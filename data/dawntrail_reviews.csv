76561198000744467,0,0,english,"My first play through of Dawntrail, coming off of Endwalker and Shadowbringer's, was sub par story wise, like most people.  However, going back through a second time with some friends just starting the game I had to take a step back and look at the reasons why I was peeved at it.   No matter which way I cut it, it was my own expectations which let me down.   I mean how many universe and world ending situations do we need to be happy.  And if the whole expansion was just sitting on a beach sipping mai tais and playing shuffle board, people would complain about no meaningful things for us to do.  Cant have a whole expansion of gold saucer 2.0, we need to do -something- and trouble always follows so that is expected.  The player character doesn't get to have nice things.   They are earmarked by the universe to suffer a lot and that is what this is.  More suffering, and if you look at it from that lens, its not being cynical, it is on par for what the character is constantly dealing with from a story perspective and from that angle, its not that bad at all.  Again, they do not get to have nice things, including a 'nice' vacation.  This is weekend at Bernie's guys.  Let it ride.I could do without the damn follow missions though.  That is more annoying than innovative.The zones are pretty streamlined.  The dungeons are pretty fun and so is the later content.  How can you not jam out to honey b lovely.  There will be more content to come and its not too late to salvage the story bits and bobs, but we have to express a slight amount of patience right. . .  how could any story we play through compare to just saving two planets and a whole universe more or less.  Its hard to meet the expectations of that build up that has been gassing up for 10 years and expect the next toss to be JUST as good as a decade of a story.   It started pretty slow too but it made sense in the end.  Be honest, when you were rocking out a real reborn would you have expected or anticipated heavens ward or shadowbringers?  Would you have said at that moment you would be sobbing on the long walk in ultima thul - no I wouldnt have thought that at all.   In ARR I did not like any of those characters either.  This is the start of another story and if the design team for this sandbox does anything good, its learning from what mistakes they have made and to try and provide a quality experience and build upon it.tl;dr:  Any new story in this game cycle would be hard to match up to provide the same satisfaction to the past 10 years of overarching narrative that just got wrapped up - and the actual gameplay content is still fun and continues to offer fun new sights and excitements.  Except those damn follow missions.  They can go to hells.",1728546795,0,0,positive

Maybe it doesn't feed into the power fantasies of some or the more likely case, these people saying the story was weak just skipped it.I personally found the story to be great, in fact, its up there with Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Lets be real, If we were to have yet another story where its basically the exact same formula, it would be boring. This expansion brings to you a new experience, not as the warrior of light but as a mentor in the story where, through your actions and experience, you help a character grow into a hero. The start is slow, yes, but Dawntrail is the start of a new adventure, in other words this should be treated the same as ARR, the foundation of the story where the following expansions will hit hard.MY ONLY ISSUE is that Y'shtola's english voice actor sounded a bit off, but that negligible. (I think it was something to do with the studio she was in, noticeable echo)So yeah, story was great, If you think it sucked, then good for you I guess? Pound sand, respectfully.The dungeons were amazing, I love the improved battle mechanics where AOE's from bosses are not just orange shapes on the ground but instead shown through their actions. This made the dungeons less brainless and more engaging. This system gets even better with the trials. I am excited to experience more dungeons and raids with these kind of mechanics.The music is seriously one of the strongest parts to the game, the dungeon music is great and good god are the trial OST's reaching new levels of peak.On an emotional level, Dawntrail has made me cry D:Overall, I seriously recommend this expansion, but do not recommend skipping the story. For an expansion that a good handful of people called terrible, it only shows that they skipped through major parts of the story and got lost in the end. So lets not send death threats to the team behind the game, this is not the friendly FFXIV community I know :D",1728328592,3,0,positive

76561197993284870,0,0,english,"The real answer to the backlash to Dawntrail is unmanaged expectations. It's like everyone's forgotten that there's still a game at the core of FF, which is still cruising along with lots of good-quality gameplay content. The reason this is down in the mixed territory is because of people too deep in their feels about the story, which was never going to match the peaks of the last two expansions capitalizing upon years and years of building exposition and investment. Outside of that, the FFXIV team has benefited from the time invested seeing what players engage with and care about, and continues to largely meet people where they are with the content they put out. If your number one consideration with playing FFXIV is the story, you might be a little put out, but if that's your number one consideration with a game, you're probably not the MMO type of player. A solid expansion with what looks to be plenty more patch content in the months ahead.",1727831425,3,0,positive
76561198005252176,115626,7338,english,"I didnt jump straight in since i was put off by the bad reviews and come off a long play session through endwalker of 4 months straight after already returning after endwalker's story content, so i took my break untill I felt the FF14 itch and proceeded to come back when it felt right.Starting off with the bad.. Well.. I usually play in Japanese voice acting but i really wanted to hear the hubub about Wuk Lamat, and oh my lord everybody is 100% right it was so bad holy moly, Apart from that the story itself is really boring too, took me 3 and a half hours of story/cutscene watching and fetching to kill 1 mob for a quest objective YIKES.. SquareEnix as a whole probly had alot of grip on the team to add a character like Wuk Lamat, she seems so..out of place during the whole experience like she was super rushed in for the ""woke"" trend big companies are eating up right now, Its hard to argue it here aswell with such a terrible character to lead the story forward..IMO, just play in Japanese Voice..for your own sake.. (Fun Fact: Japanese Voice Makes the Praetorium custcenes faster too :D ) Now for the good things i really liked.New class abilities: They go hard, love em they look sick as like all ff14 skills and its why i choose this over other MMO'sMobs/Bosses/Dungeons: They are top tier,  End game is your usual endgame for ff14 really fun and engaging especially this time around where the difficulty has been bumped up quite a notch for regular content I enjoyed it. I felt the same during endwalker they bumped up the generally difficulty, its not insanely hard but you will probly die once or twice then memorise the pattern etc.The mobs arnt too bad this time around with Copy/Paste there is alot of brand NEW mobs added which was quite nice not seeing different variants of old creatures, I Commend them for that Well done.I truly believe this is worth the pickup if you like FF14 Endgame especially on a sale, If you are just playing specifically for the story..unlucky heh..",1727761818,6,0,positive

I think this is also a great starting point for someone new and then run NG+ for older content. After playing DT I felt much more inclined to go back and experience the story not because I had so many questions but because now I knew what kind of experience I was getting.,1727736235,7,1,positive

L'aventure se fait avec notre équipe et pas uniquement avec le Guerrier de la lumière.Certes, l'épopée est longue au début mais est nécessaire pour nous faire apprécier chacun des personnages.Les zones sont magnifique, les musiques époustouflantes, les combats a couper le souffle.- Les jobs Viper et Picto sont très cool à jouer.- Si vous aimez l’ambiance été, vacances, futuriste et découverte de nouveaux horizons, ce DLC est top.- Je dirait que le seul défaut non spoiler de cette extension est le doublage anglais. Ma note est de 19/20.En espérant que mon évaluation vous aura été utile. - N'oubliez pas d’apprécier chaque moments avec les guerriers de la lumière.

76561198051091739,79556,8942,english,"As a Puerto Rican fan with thousands of hours in this game across many platforms, Dawntrail felt like coming home to me. It's rare to see a game within the fantasy genre (let alone high fantasy) do anything resembling the mythos or aesthetic variety of Latin America without just going full Mayan fantasy purely. From the zones, music, fashion designs, linguistics involved in naming versus presentation, and so on, you can really feel the love and care put into making up for earlier expansion shortcomings in making sensitive choices with respect and research to the people whose fantasies they represent. I didn't expect nearly all of the Americas as they were to have a fantasy here, let alone a complex representation of diaspora that is so common among the stories and legacies of many within the Caribbean, South America, and beyond. I love Tural and I hope to see more of it even outside of MSQ content, given its massive size in this universe. At the very least show us some of the Northern climates or the vast deserts that they hint at. (It reaches from the north to the south poles!) Beyond that, I found many of the themes and characters surrounding love and unity to be very touching. For this reason, Part 1 (Yak Tural) for the Rite of Succession is 9/10 for me.Part 2 (Xak Tural) feels like it suffers two glaring problems: Pacing and Priorities. The story evolves into itself at rapid pace and the fun exploratory worldbuilding surrounding the first half of the expansion falls to the wayside for questlines that are either end-of-the-world or completely unrelated filler with almost no in-between. I found myself questioning why the Rite of Succession left out the peoples here when they were part of Tural's unity and made up huge swathes of its capital city's demographics. I wondered why we had only begun learning the history and complex motivations surrounding a major villain in the 30 second lead up prior to fighting them. I wondered why we were not shown more of the visual horror surrounding the iconography of a major character tethered to Solution 9 and its people, etc.This half suffers not from a lack of good ideas, but from a rather peculiar way of showcasing them, in what order, and either with a lot of build-up or absolutely zero at all. To me it feels like they ran out of time to do all the things they wanted with Xak Tural before release and that these may have been shifted as things to be explored in the post-MSQ patch series. With that in mind for the initial experience, the battle content, big major scenes, and presentation was all memorable! But felt quite unearned with how fast it occurred in a lot of places. For that reason, Part 2 of DT (Xak Tural) is a solid 6/10 at best for me.I admit I have a bias starting from the first sentence of this review. I love JRPG tales about friendship and love (FF8 was my first) and especially worldbuilding. I've nothing to say about the voice acting other than that the VAs were all great picks, it was just the voice direction that needed work in some parts (I wish ENG Gulool Ja Ja was as vocally bombastic as his JP counterpart prior to Mamook, for example). I've played this expansion twice now both in JP and ENG and found that characters matched each other's vibes and energies well.All in all, Dawntrail is an 8/10 for me and within my top three of favorite expansions for the foreseeable future (so long as the post-MSQ content doesn't radically alter my opinions for better or worse). Please consider Tuliyollal housing due to the post-DT world state and Solution 9 interiors for apartments!",1727693866,13,2,positive

Heavensward Story and Stormblood without Post Content was mid and I think/hope this will be the sam. Especially after the copious amount of ""Feedback"".As a sidenote: If anyone says this game has a great community, they are lying. If anything this expansion showed my what entitled crybabies they are.

76561198044845170,0,0,english,"Mixed is probably the right rating for this expansion:Positives+ Fight design is less plodding and more focused on being faster-paced. In extremes & savage, there is little repetition of mechanics and when they are repeated it's often with a twist applied. There is far less reliance on body checks to halt progression and as a whole savage has been much more fun and a lot less miserable/frustrating. For regular content like dungeons, I feel a lot less fatigue with the Lv.100 Expert dungeons compared to the EW equivalents (Stigma Dreamscape and Smileton).+ Some graphics update features were quite good; additional grass/foliage adds a lot to scenes in a subtle way, a lot of effects and locales look a bit better (but not universal). On the whole good changes, though some tweaks were not to everyone's liking and some oddities exist.+ The new zones look cool and have nice vibes to them+ Role Quests were good fun this time around.Negatives- Poor MSQ story structure and character building; there was a lot of promise in the concepts and characters, but the way events and moments were laid out and presented ultimately bungled that potential. The way in which the player engaged with the story through tasks, instanced battles, etc. was also quite poorly set out with a lot of reliance on dialogue & fetch quests, not a lot of innovation on those tasks, and not peppering enough combat in the right places to help alleviate it. Instanced battles were also quite repetitive; the player fights the same enemy type in the first 3 battle instances, with 1 & 3 being mostly the same, and 2 forcing a moveset that's 1 button with very little cooldowns to use.- Job design had little rework; long standing issues from as far back as ShB are still present in some, like MCH's disjointed AOE issues and wildfire being a problem for those with high latency. Most jobs were given a lazy addition of a few follow-up actions on their existing actions, some of which exacerbate issues they had in EW (Reaper's burst, for instance, is quite rigid and having a follow-up added to the very end makes it even more so). Damage potencies on jobs have gotten even higher, leading to heavier swings in damage variance for those without guaranteed critical hits and more heavily punishing players if they slip out of the shared 2-min damage windows.- Graphics Update implementation left a lot to be desired; some crucial options missing (bloom intensity for instance), and the technology used for AA relies on motion blur (TMAA) which strains the eyes. Some players have been driven out of the game because of that issue alone. As for me, I had to go back down to FXAA and tinker around to find a good balance. Audio continues to be muddy in a lot of places. Some locations and lighting look quite flat (Quicksand for instance) or outright bad (off the top of my head, the lighting in Brute Justice's arena is very dark).- The two-dye channel implementation has been quite questionable for a lot of pieces of equipment; some resort to setting the 2nd dye channel to be something asinine like the thread on buttons rather than something more prominent. Other pieces that would have benefited greatly from a 2nd dye channel, on the other hand, have been left with 1. In general, a bit of a baffling set of decisions were made.- This is a personal opinion, but I feel zones are needlessly large and it hinders adding personal touches and flair to them. ARR zones continue to be the best in the game for all their little locales, attention to detail, and special FATEs that actually influence the settlements and areas around them. Since HW, most zones (not all) have suffered from just feeling like giant maps with enemy groups spattered throughout them. ARR zones, on the other hand, have enemies that feel like they're native to the area, mixing together, and factions in small camps tucked away into the corners.OverallIt's an odd one; some aspects seem great and are moving in the right direction, while other aspects are stagnating or getting worse. The change in fight design, if it holds, will help immensely going through the middle and end of the expansion; particularly if it extends to the upcoming field operation. I feel that's more important overall than the MSQ quality, but it'll likely leave a sour taste in people's mouths if it doesn't show improvement. I've a feeling there are some good ideas in the works, but if they aren't executed correctly then it's going to be really disappointing.",1727287125,23,0,positive

76561198143210446,0,0,english,"I have a thousand hours in this game, played through all content and take my time with each and every story. Here are my thoughts after spending 100 + hours on Dawntrail.Story: The story is bad. Period. Anyone who claims otherwise under the guise of, ""it's a new adventure it's supposed to be slow"", ""you can't compare it to shadow bringers and endwalker that was a culmination of 10 years of story..."" either has no idea what components and ideas make a good story or they refuse to take off their rose tinted glasses because they believe Yoshi-P and his dev team can do no wrong. There is a way to write stories that are slow that make you question the narative and entice you to dig deep and understand the entire picture. Every FF expansion does this EXCEPT Dawntrail. If you asked people what they think the main theme is to every FF expansion you'll likely get different answers because there are many themes and many ideas that make you question what is right and what is wrong. Dawntrail does that for about 1/20 of the story near the end, the rest of Dawntrails story theme boils down to ""If We UnDeRsTaNd EaChOtHeR We WiLl AlL GeT AlOnG"" And it is forcefully shoved in your face throughout the entire expansion when you are not doing completely mundane tasks. Quest Design: Uninspired, I'm not saying the other expansions had better quest design but when there is a good story that keeps you intrigued uninspired quest design can be forgiven. When the story literally makes you fall asleep or makes you want to walk away and play a different game, have uninspired quests can be a deal breaker, and many times during my play sessions it was. I literally had to stop and just go do something else. It took me a month to finally finish the story out of sheer will. Trials/Dungeons/New Raid: Now with the absolute pitfall of a story and boring quest design there is a ton of positives when it comes to the Trials/Dungeons/Raids. They are absolutely fantastic. Well balanced, semi difficult, and good music. They absolutely nailed it with the actual game play. This alone makes me still recommend this expansion.Overall Thoughts: The story of Dawntrail is an example of poor writing. Make any excuse you want, the actual narative and writing of this story is fundamentally bad. Many people blame it on the character Wuk Lamat but even if you replaced her with a well voiced character that would not change the foundational issues with the character and the story. The quest design needs to improve. In this day and age having generic fetch quests, kill quests, etc. will lose players. Yes I understand that these quests build upon the lore and have meaning behind the story which makes them better than most mmorpgs but that doesn't matter. There is a better way to tell the story from boring unimaginative quest design and hours of cutscenes. If they don't change that in the future then FF14 will start to go down the path of WOW where everyone rushes through the story just to get to the ""real game."" I would hate to see this wonderfully narrative focused game to go down that path. I still hold Yoshi-P and his Dev team in high regards and the reason why I am very critical of this expansions story is because I know that this Dev team is capable of writing complex and compelling stories. With that being said the actual endgame of Dawntrail so far has been wonderful and for that reason alone this gets my recommendation. But for anyone who buys this expansion or plays ff14 just for the story be warned. The story of Dawntrail is mediocre at best and abysmal at it's worst. ",1727053889,3,0,positive

76561198850270853,23458,18,english,"[SPOILER ALERT] When I first got into the dlc I had a very bad expectations thanks to all the fuss and drama. I've been sick which allowed me to finish the story in one go in 4 days and I'll be honest if this is what is called ""ABYSSMAL DOGSHIT!"" ""POOR WRITING!"" ""THE WORST MMO DLC EVER!!!!"" nowdays then I'm starting to lose the hope in humanity.The first half of dlc is a solid roadmovie where you visit all the nations of Tuliyolal and learn about their culture while helping Wuk Lamat compete in Rite Of Succession. During the rite you complete quests and solve problems of these nations and by doing that you come to understand their culture and customs all of that forms the main theme of Dawntrail that is ""Only by understanding and respecting each others traditions we can achieve peace"". Somehow that philosophy is wrong for someone or its not ""realistic"", well if you want real politics you can look in the window, because this is the whole point the lesson that Gurool Ja Ja tried to teach his Promises and that only Wuk Lamat could understand because others tried to scheme or brute force their way through the rite while Wuk Lamat being neither strongest nor smartest but by being honest and friendly get herself friends and connections because when you think of it Wuk Lamat didn't do anything except swinging her axe for the whole thing while scions, us and others did all the dirty job that allowed her to go through all trials. But isn't it exactly what leader is supposed to do? Treat others with respect to rely on them and divide power between capable people to ahieve the result? And the fact that she awknowledges her own flaws and makes Koana the Vow Of Reason for the better of the nation is alone shows how much she grows as a character in comparison to what we started. And yet some people still struggle to see that probably because its hard to relate to big furry cat or trans VA or something idk what happens in the heads of the ""BASED"" people who seriously think that Serious Sam, Postal or Duke Nukem are peak of gaming. Not to mention numerous other characters having their arcs that trace throrought the whole dlc and have their conclusion and somehow people still pissed because their favourite Scions did nothing and didn't get their screen time yeah I wonder why new characters with new arcs dominate in the new dlc when old characters had their arcs developed for the PAST TEN (10) YEARS, seriously people bring up NUMBER OF VOICELINES SAID by characters saying that Wuk Lamat being at the top is somehow takes away all the time from others but would they try to look at GLOBAL amount of lines said by characters in all story they would probably find Urianger's or Minfilia's blabbering on the top and that is somehow is different (Btw Sphene is 2nd place with half as much dialogue because she is literally is Wuk Lamat's antipod and theirs is the main story conflict but this is for later). All of that just to justify the ""boredom"" these players feel probably having 5 minute tiktok attention span for doing small unimportant tasks in an goddamn MMO the genre that's whole philosophy is built upon that you as player must by doing small unrelated unimportant tasks level up and build your strengh to face the gods. Yes without all that shit if they'd just allowed you always do interesting shit like dungeons or raids they would neither been interesting nor had any meaning. And that whole thing about doing quests to gain characters trust and friendship is still somehow different that what you've been doing in Ala Mhigo, Doma, Ishgard, Garlemald and so on. Okay next goes the little Western arc that people call ""filler"" even though it moves the Namikka arc, Erenvile arc and introduces you to characters that will later help breach the barrier and defend Xak Tural later on. Even referencing ShB and just like in ShB you get this cool moment where all characters gather to build something so you can access new dungeon which is epic. Somehow once again these people don't get enough fanservice even tho there is shitton of it like when Endwalker starts playing and dragons appear in the skies or the whole Alexandria thing being one big tribute to FF9. Then begins the second part of story which introduces the said Alexandria and queen Sphene that questions the story theme and creates a very dramatic conflict between her and Wuk Lamat. There we dispose of chaotic evil trash that being Zoral Ja that some people believe is the main antagonist for some reason (which obviously is Sphene and not Zoral Ja) and for some reason people compare him to Emet-Selch (are you stupid?). Zoral Ja is a typical chaotic evil psychopath that was created by failing to live up to people's expectations that turned him into hating everything and doing all the shit he did the only purpose of these characters is to become a quick fun encounters for us to beat the shit of them and feel good about it (and yet its still somehow different from Zenos or Ilberd), it is exactly because there are all these different shades of evil that allow us to appreciate villains like Emet-Selch or Sphene or Hermes. And then even he gets his arc awknologing his child and passing his bloody legacy to him in the end. Then we get to the PEAK when we enter the city of gold the living memory where all the Endless are and that is one big tribute to FF9. This zone is something special, the feels it gives by just being there vibing to music and the unimaginable work of artists deserving to be exhibited in museums. All of that beauty that you yourself destroy freeing all the Endless's souls just to turn in all to black, devoted of colors, souless monument without music and that hits SO HARD and that thing alone justifies whatever shit that happened in the story. How would you possibly complain about that? And still some people tell that it should have been different that ""What right we have to ""kill"" all these ""living"" people to save our own. Did we become Emet-Selch ourselves?"", that we should have found a way to save everyone. No dipshits this conflict was built like it should have been what else you think supposed to happen when Sphene herself said that she is no more than ""bearer of real Queen Sphene memories"" and that Preservation intentionally created her to be a mechanism that is whole purpose is to find a way to sustain the Endless and the only way is to feed them with Aether which means to destroy your own world? She even went as far to ask you ""Could you have done different?"" and the answer is no you yourself killed Emet-Selch, Elidibus and Lahabrea in the same manner who's goal was too to deliver his breathren at any cost by rejoining the world. This living memory is just Amaurot 2 that filled with artificial constructs of people's memories trying to simulate ""what ifs"" while feeding on a Aether of living beings. This is another impossible Utopia like what Ascians tried to achieve, saving it its like saying Arasaka in cp2077 is good. ""When one nation wishes to destroy another war happenes"" so the best we can do is to understand and remember that they existed same like with Emet-Selch. All of the complaints look to me as if group of insecure kids are mad because they didn't get their ass licked by their favourite fictional characters because they were expecting a ""vacation"".In the end of this what I wanted to say is that real BAD or ABYSSMAL DOGSHIT stories doesn't do that. You don't even need to go far for examples take any modern Blizzard shit, any modern Bungie shit, Lost Ark; from other genres, any Ubisoft game hell even some Square Enix games like Stranger Of Paradise or FORSPOKEN - those are pure examples of bad writing. Bad stories doesn't know what they are about, they don't care for character arcs either forgetting them or not finishing them bad stories doesn't make you think or feel anything. This one did make me feel so at worst its mid and with the amazing music, encounters, locations combines into solid 7/10.",1726859958,0,1,positive

76561199120059783,0,0,english,"DawnTrail isn’t an action-packed expansion filled with massive battles or moments where you’re the undeniable hero. Instead, it places you in a more supportive role, focusing on trials, cultural exploration, and personal connections. For me, the slower pace of the story made the adventure enjoyable, especially as the final quarter of the game shifts gears, introducing more tension and mystery.While the number of dungeons and trials may be limited, they stand out for their increased difficulty. Unlike previous expansions where I could breeze through them, DawnTrail demanded my full attention. The emotional depth of the story towards the end struck a chord with me, making me tear up as it reflected relatable struggles. The unexpected twists and the emotional climax made the ending truly memorable, surpassing even Stormblood in my personal ranking.Now, onto some constructive criticism. There's been a lot of polarized reactions, with people either loving or hating the expansion—sometimes for reasons that feel unwarranted. For example, some have criticized the voice actor who plays Wuk Lamat for being trans. This comment from people can be ignored. Frankly, that shouldn’t be an issue. While I found Wuk Lamat a bit overly positive at times, that’s more a writing choice than a performance problem. Ill will say there is a moment at the end where thought "" very odd and a little forced"". There were moments when her delivery felt flat, and I think the direction could have been stronger. On the other hand, Y’shtola’s audio quality was disappointing—it sounded compressed, as if it wasn’t recorded in a studio, which I hope gets patched in an update.A few plot points in the latter half of the story felt forced, as if they were written to move the narrative forward without fully making sense. Despite these issues, I had a lot of fun with DawnTrail. It may not reach the heights of Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but it's a solid start to a new arc. I’m excited to see where the story goes next and to experience the emotions the writers aim to evoke. Does it have flaws? Yes. But is it a bad expansion? Absolutely not.",1725857945,2,1,positive

I understand that people are not happy with Wuk Lamat but I think a big part is the poor performance of her English VA (voiceactor). I play with japanese dub and english subtitles right now. In Endwalker both was set on english but the recent change in performancequality was just too big for me. If a character like Wuk Lamat takes the spotlight, the VA has to be on top of his/her game. But that's sadly not the case. Gameplay is still the same as always. The classes get new and fancy spells, new dungeons/trials with fun mechanics, plenty of sidecontent and a story worth listening to. It's a shame so many people hate on the game but in comparison to the older addons it's a solid expansion 7.5/10. It's not revolutionary or the best I ever played but I can guarantee everyone who's not sure if he/she should get the game don't worry.

I've played for about 5k-ish hours, done several pieces of side content to completion, and have a pretty good grasp on the story. The story for this expac is not as good as ShB or Endwalker. Yes, they're trying something somewhat new, and while that was the end of a decade long story, this is trying to do something different. My issue, and a lot of other people's, is how the WoL is treated and Wuk Lamat (oh boy). Personally, I'm completely fine with having my character take a step back and getting to a sort of normalcy in the MSQ that you didn't really see since the first part of ARR. You're just a normal adventurer, doin' normal tasks and not treated like the gods' gift to earth. My issue is that I don't think Wuk Lamat can carry the story on her back considering how much free time is given to her. Her story feels like it stopped evolving halfway and it gets very bland when the story actually gets kind of cool. The voice acting is also questionable, but I blame bad direction. Content-wise, it's great. I'm glad we have more difficult encounters in normal content now, and the raid series is actually quite fun this time around. But that's outside of the normal MSQ questing that can be as monotonous as ever. It can get pretty bad. Personally I blame the lack of more instanced fights. There's maybe 2-3 the entire MSQ. A lot of quests end up being ""talk to three NPCs, where one of them has actually useful information.""My normal, ""should you buy this"" doesn't work here since the other DLCs are bundled into this. There's no point in skipping an entire expac. As MSQ goes, it's definitely weaker than the last two expacs, but Im hopeful in terms of content. Plus, this is still excluding the patch quests. Some of the best story in the game came from patch content (namely 3.3 and 5.3).",1725372682,0,0,positive

The devs stated from the get-go this would be a lower stakes expansion after the excitement that was EW and that we would take on a more supportive role as opposed to being the 'star' of the story. I guess some people lack basic reading comprehension. Anyways, Dawntrail is a great feel-good story that achieves its mission statement of being a much more relaxed and less dire scenario, it was never going to reach the same heights as ShB or EW because it was never meant to, we just watched the overarching plot of the last 4 expansions and base game be resolved, it's time for a break. It's paced very well, you don't dawdle in any one area overly long, the story beats are all very well done even if you can see one or two coming, there were even two particularly emotional bits in particular that got my eyes genuinely watering. Soken as per usual killed it with the music and both new classes are a blast to play. The new locales are gorgeous and the climax and post-story dungeons and raids are all excellent, there's also a LOT of FFIX love in there that will make any fan smile. Also Wuk Lamat is a great character, she has very real growth over the course of the story and isn't the 'Mary Sue' people make her out to be, the fact the same people that complain about how 'awful' she is also directly harass her VA for 'ruining' the character should tell you all you need. I don't like to address people whinging over nothing in reviews because that ultimately has nothing to do with the actual game, but with the blatant review bombing DT has gotten I feel it prudent to point out that the whinging will only ever be just that, and the personal failings of people to manage their expectations is not reflective of what is a very well done expansion.",1725311190,3,1,positive

76561198113301612,0,0,german,"Rezension zu Final Fantasy XIV: DawntrailEinleitung:Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail stellt die neueste Erweiterung des weltweit beliebten MMORPGs Final Fantasy XIV dar und markiert einen bedeutenden Wendepunkt in der Geschichte des Spiels. Als vierte große Erweiterung nach Shadowbringers und Endwalker war die Erwartungshaltung der Fans entsprechend hoch. Nach dem emotionalen Abschluss der langen Geschichte um Hydaelyn und Zodiark bringt Dawntrail die Spieler in neue Gebiete und bietet ihnen die Möglichkeit, die Welt von Eorzea weiter zu erkunden, nun jedoch mit einem frischen Abenteuergefühl und einer neuen, unverbrauchten Handlung.Geschichte und Setting:Die Geschichte von Dawntrail entführt die Spieler in eine bisher unerforschte Region der Welt, bekannt als Tural. Diese neue Welt ist von tropischen Wäldern, weitläufigen Stränden und uralten Tempeln geprägt. Das Setting erinnert an südamerikanische und mesoamerikanische Kulturen, was sich in der Architektur, den Kostümen und den Bräuchen der dortigen Bevölkerung widerspiegelt. Es ist eine willkommene Abwechslung von den bisherigen Schauplätzen, die oft eher europäische oder asiatische Einflüsse aufwiesen.Die Handlung selbst dreht sich um eine mysteriöse Prophezeiung, die das Ende eines Zeitalters und den Aufstieg eines neuen Herrschers vorhersagt. Die Spieler werden in die Rolle eines Abenteurers gedrängt, der mit der Aufgabe betraut ist, die Zukunft dieser neuen Welt zu bestimmen. Die Geschichte ist weniger düster als die vorherigen Erweiterungen und vermittelt stattdessen ein Gefühl von Aufbruch und Abenteuer. Dennoch fehlt es nicht an dramatischen Wendungen und tiefgründigen Charaktermomenten, die die Spieler in ihren Bann ziehen.Gameplay:Im Gameplay von Dawntrail hat Square Enix bewährte Mechaniken beibehalten und gleichzeitig neue Elemente eingeführt, um das Spielerlebnis frisch zu halten. Die Erweiterung bringt zwei neue Klassen, die beide sorgfältig gestaltet wurden, um verschiedene Spielstile zu bedienen. Die Viper, eine DPS-Klasse, die sich auf schnelle Angriffe und hohe Mobilität konzentriert, und der Geomant, ein Support-Job, der mit Elementarmagie und Heilfähigkeiten glänzt, bieten sowohl für Neulinge als auch für Veteranen neue Herausforderungen.Die neuen Gebiete in Tural sind weitläufig und laden zur Erkundung ein. Die Vielfalt an Landschaften, von dichten Dschungeln bis hin zu alten Ruinen, bietet den Spielern zahlreiche Möglichkeiten, sich in der Welt zu verlieren. Das Erkunden dieser Gebiete ist ein zentrales Element der Erweiterung, wobei die Spieler ihre bisherigen Mounts und Fortbewegungsmittel weiterhin nutzen können, um die weitläufigen Areale zu durchqueren.Ein bemerkenswerter Aspekt von Dawntrail sind die neuen Dungeons und Raids, die auf eine Mischung aus herausfordernden Kämpfen und cleverem Design setzen. Die Dungeons sind weniger auf Open-World-Elemente ausgelegt, sondern bieten durchdachte, instanzierte Erfahrungen, die sowohl taktisches Geschick als auch Teamarbeit erfordern. Die Entwickler haben dabei ein gutes Gleichgewicht zwischen fordernden Bosskämpfen und Rätseln gefunden, die das Tempo des Spiels abwechslungsreich gestalten.Zusätzlich bringt Dawntrail auch Verbesserungen in der Handwerks- und Sammelmechanik mit sich. Es gibt neue Rohstoffe, die gesammelt und verarbeitet werden können, sowie anspruchsvolle Rezepte, die die Kreativität und Geduld der Spieler auf die Probe stellen.Grafik und Sound:Grafisch zeigt Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail erneut, warum es eines der schönsten MMORPGs auf dem Markt ist. Die Entwickler haben sichtlich viel Zeit in die Gestaltung der neuen Welt Tural investiert. Die detaillierte Flora und Fauna, die leuchtenden Farben der Landschaften und die lebendige Darstellung der Städte und Dörfer tragen dazu bei, dass sich die Spieler in diese neue Region vollständig eintauchen können.Auch die Charaktermodelle und Animationen sind von hoher Qualität, was besonders bei den neuen Klassen auffällt. Die Viper bewegt sich mit einer fließenden Eleganz, die ihren Kampfstil unterstreicht, während der Geomant durch seine majestätischen Zauberanimationen beeindruckt.Der Soundtrack von Dawntrail ist, wie von Final Fantasy XIV gewohnt, herausragend. Komponist Masayoshi Soken hat erneut einen Soundtrack geschaffen, der sowohl epische Momente als auch ruhige, besinnliche Augenblicke perfekt untermalt. Die Musik wechselt nahtlos zwischen heiteren Melodien und dramatischen Stücken, je nachdem, was die Handlung erfordert, und bleibt dabei immer im Gedächtnis.Community und Multiplayer-Erfahrung:Die Community von Final Fantasy XIV ist bekannt für ihre Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft, und Dawntrail macht hier keine Ausnahme. Die neuen Gruppeninhalte, wie die extremen Prüfungen und Raids, fördern das kooperative Spielen und belohnen Spieler, die sich gut abstimmen und zusammenarbeiten.Square Enix hat außerdem das Matchmaking-System weiter verbessert, um Neulingen den Einstieg zu erleichtern und das Erlebnis für erfahrene Spieler angenehmer zu gestalten. Die neuen sozialen Features, wie erweiterte Gildenhäuser und verbesserte Chat-Funktionen, tragen ebenfalls dazu bei, das Gemeinschaftsgefühl zu stärken.Fazit:Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail ist eine herausragende Erweiterung, die das Fundament, das mit den vorherigen Erweiterungen gelegt wurde, erfolgreich erweitert. Es bietet eine fesselnde Geschichte, frisches Gameplay, atemberaubende visuelle und akustische Erlebnisse und eine weiterhin starke Community. Für Fans der Serie ist Dawntrail ein Muss, und auch Neueinsteiger finden hier einen idealen Einstiegspunkt in die Welt von Final Fantasy XIV.Square Enix hat es erneut geschafft, die Erwartungen der Spieler nicht nur zu erfüllen, sondern sie sogar zu übertreffen. Dawntrail zeigt, dass auch nach über einem Jahrzehnt Final Fantasy XIV noch immer eines der besten MMORPGs auf dem Markt ist und bleibt.",1725279377,1,0,positive

76561198089795897,0,0,english,"Because the reviews are overrun with one to two line sentences of people who just don't like the protagonist of the Dawntrail MSQ, I thought that it would do the  game justice give an actual review.I feel like a lot of the reviews are missing the fact that the story development is re-entering a world building phase for the most part, as Endwalker closed off a lot of the over-arching cross-universal threats. Stakes in Dawntrail are relatively lower at first and is inundated with fetch and ""go talk to""-quests, as JRPGs and story-driven content is wont to do. However, the core facets of the game remain strong. For new players you will be received by a predominately welcoming in-game community with a very helpful player-base. Story-wise, if you're new, you'll start with A Realm Reborn, which is heavily story driven and can drag on as it is dedicated to introducing the player to the personalities within the story and developing a world in which the story takes place. These are characters that have now been a part of the story and a lot of avid fans of FFXIV for up to 14 years now as the original release for the 1.0 version of the game was 2010. Casually, you can expect to progress through that story in about a month, but more hardcore gamers can complete it in 2 weeks with a multitude of YouTube videos available online to supplement any missed details. From there, there are a multitude of robust expansions that bolster the story line and the capabilities of your characters.For those who have left FFXIV in past expansions and were thinking about returning with Dawntrail (as I did), you can expect there to be more of what you've already experienced with continuous updates and patches being released to the progress Post-MSQ storyline. The most recent Savage Tier is fun and relatively challenging (it's appropriate to it being the first tier) with the new Alliance Raid crossing over with Final Fantasy XI. New jobs were released with Viper and Pictomancer - both of which have a smooth game play flow, and currently very often the dominant DPS in raids (Reaper is still very relevant, as is Monk). Overall the game is still great, the Dawntrail expansion story line is immersive and fun, but keep in mind the world-building that is slated to take place as the story is having to develop a new overarching antagonist for the coming years.",1725225942,2,0,positive

And that can definitely come off as worse then the previous expac.  stakes are considerably smaller and our char is not in the spotlight here.  Wuk Lamat is very much main char here and this can be jarring for people that have gotten used to us being in the forefront.  This expac is the start of a new storyline in the series and we are very much put in the mentor role to these new chars.  mostly because we are the god destroying warhead of the previous storyline.  If it feels lackluster it is only because they have to introduce these new chars and show their growth.  If you compare this expac with the first one of the previous storyline, base ARR it's about in the same place.  all the interesting things in ARR happened post patch.  I do not worry about the story.  let them cook.

Its honestly the weakest link of this expansion so far and thats a bad thing for an mmo thats touted for its story. Characters just aren't developed well. Certain characters get far more screen time than equally important ones. The entire Shaalaoni region feels like filler. The pacing and tone can be wildly off at times. There certainly are good spots though, particularly near the end.Additionally I think the game's narrative is harmed by it's predictability. If you've played the last 3 expansions you can tell exactly when you're gonna get a dungeon or trial as they're always at the same level and it feels like they had to shoehorn in a reason for doing these into the narrative to make it make sense.Class design is also steadily getting worse. New classes are good but old classes keep getting gutted especially dark knight. Many classes are not fun on early levels.Despite that the areas and music are amazing(excluding Smile). The dungeons and trials, while very predictable in design, have been a blast and the new savage raids are some of my favorites to date.All in all if you're this far in then I'd buy it.

76561198040219861,0,0,english,"We all know the real reason this expansion has gotten so many negative reviews.We all know why Wuk Lamat is mentioned in every single review, positive or negative, as the single most defining factor of the expansion, despite being a relatively well written character.We all know why people are complaining about the writing being anime, or the story being going form point A to point B and triggering a cutscene, despite the fact that that's all the game ever has been.We all know why, that despite the game having the best combat since release, people are undervaluing how fun it is.We all know why people are saying the story is lackluster, despite being far better than ARR and even Stormblood, as well as the post EW story that came just before.We all know why the steam community posts are so toxic here.It's because Wuk Lamat's VA is trans.So people have to critique the VA work, and then it spirals into hating all forms of DEI.Check the actual player numbers, how good the player retention is, how the peak player count is higher in Dawntrail than it ever has been. Talk to your FC members, ask them how good this expansion is and how much fun they're having. You'll quickly see how much of an echo chamber the steam community is, of transphobic negativity.Dawntrail is probably the best expansion they could have done coming out of Endwalker. Setting up a new world full of interesting societies and communities. A character driven story, where the focus is on family and moving on past the end, all with a meso-american inspired tie in (including the Spanish inquisition, bringing the idea of salvation with them). The best content the game has ever seen. The most diverse and unique areas that we've had since Shadowbringers. Lovable characters who are strikingly down to earth and relatable, yet equally flawed and forced to develop. And one of the best antagonists I've ever seen in a story, keeping the momentum from earlier expansions.With content like 24 man savage and the next tier of raids on the way, Dawntrail is shaping up to be more fun than Endwalker, even if the story is lower stakes and doesn't revolve around you being a universe saving god for once.",1725123027,5,1,positive

I enjoyed the first part of the msq for """"allowing"""" me to do more side content in the areas i was visiting like a tourist/adventurer would do, without having to worry about the world ending or whatever. The second part of the msq is where the story actually picks up but again, the pacing is so all over the place where its hard to get very hooked at, not to mention that at some point the Wol should have said ""its woling time"" and handle the situation ourselves, instead of having Wuk Lamat randomly appear at spots.Never the less, the overall story experience is good and Alexandria does bring up some good morality questions to ponder about like most FF titles do.The side content is where DT shines through with very fun Dungeons and Raids.Admittedly like most people here said, its very hard to follow up Endwalker and it's build up with a new story that doesn't end up feeling ARR. But unlike ARR this time, there's much more fun stuff to do and the story isn't always a slop.Side note: but i'd recommend playing this with the Japanese VA this time and this is coming from someone that always had the English cast on. It has nothing to do with the voice actors, but the actual voice directing this time is horrendous.

I LOVED Dawntrail, not because i was forced to babysit someone, I loved Dawntrail because of the cultures, the differences in life styles, the explanations as to each one of their histories and how beautiful this unknown region is to the player, and to this character we babysit is going to rule over. I feel like this is forgotten information, between the time it took for them to complete post EW, and the time it took them to release dawntrail, but towards the end of Post EW, you sign a verbal contract with this person you are 'forced to babysit' to help them on THEIR quest to become the ruler of THEIR land. It is at this same time that pieces of the puzzle are slowly brought together to allude to the players friends are also going to this unknown land that the person who is babysitting is going to as well. I knew from that moment that this was not going to be my story, and that should be ok. Yes, it was a bit frustrating to see all the epic moments taken away by this person we are babysitting, but to say that is the soul reason why you dont enjoy the expansion, and downvote it despite liking literally every other part of the content is a bit petty.The player character in ff14 has always had the sense of adventure and trying to do what is right. Helping someone learn the culture of their region that is absolutely terrifying for them shouldn't fall out of the player characters alignment. with that being said, we do not decide to stay with this person either, in fact she offers a place for us to stay should we be stopping by on our adventures.So, over all, We(the player character) agreed to the arrangement (of having the spotlight off of us) in post Endwalker Content as we explore someone else's story.

The setting was likeable, the pacing wasn't bad (to me Endwalker's pacing was terrible), and the smaller stakes throughout were a nice change of pace from world or universe ending threats. I'm someone who likes being introduced to a lot of new things, though. If you prefer a lot of action then you'll be disappointed by the story (though the dungeons and trials are superb). If you wanted to see more of the scions then you won't get to see a lot of the usual cast, though Wuk Lamat does bring a different type of energy than the usual smooth, smart, cool scions.The first two thirds of the expansion tell the story of Wuk Lamat's growth from a naive, unsure claimant to a confident and able ruler. The story introduces you to a new continent and the (fairly shallow but overall likeable) cultures in the new areas. It has some smaller conflicts that get resolved throughout and a fairly large conflict gets resolved at the two thirds mark. Yes,  you do follow Wuk Lamat as a mentor for most of the first half. You have little agency and mostly support her and mentor her through cutscenes, which can be frustrating if you like to be the main character. I didn't mind seeing her story develop, though the beginning was a little slow with just following her while she does mundane tasks (at least you get to meet the new cultures).The last third is interesting, starting with resolving the main conflict of the first two thirds. The rest of the game wrestles with the conflict of living in the memories of the past at all costs, or letting the past go but carrying those memories forward. The ending, basically ""memory heaven"", is fairly unique and the story is enjoyable. To me it was a very strong last third, and solidly cemented this game as my second favorite expansion. Combat in this expansion, at least for the classes I play, has been a blast. Dungeons have a lot of quick thinking required and don't feel like you're going through the motions while beating up a damage sponge. The final boss was absolutely the best combat experience I had in FF14. The classes I play were fortunately adjusted in a way where they play more naturally and there's less awkward cooldown delaying or rotation correcting. Overall, I highly enjoyed it, but I am also someone who loves fantasy cultures and politics and a good exposition dump.

76561198138831939,245841,2452,english," Incredibly tragic to see this expansion wrapped up in culture wars bullshit from every side. I have zero interest in talking about that, however, other than to acknowledge you can dislike things without becoming exclusionary and bigoted.  Outside of that though, I think this was a lovely expansion for the game and well sets the scene for what we can expect going forward with this next 'arc' of the MMO. It's a story that puts our characters in the backseat to allow us a trip to a new world to see things from their perspective rather than ours. It's rather elegant how they managed to pull off most of a story like this without it feeling like we are unjustly involving ourselves in matters. And what a place itself it was to explore! Tural and it's people are a delight and it inspires me further to write narratively about the universe. Characters are great too. Wuk Lamat as our protagonist is an immediate standout for all the bubbly warmth she brings to the party, but there's hardly any character that feels awful. Sphene perhaps is a bit akward but that more has to do with pacing. On that note: the pacing is my only real significant issue. I think the first bulk of the expansion with the trials to become dawnservant were all reasonably and well paced. But as we dip into spoiler zones it becomes a bit... crammed in. I certainly liked a lot of the elements present, but it just felt very tacked on to the expansion. I think it would have worked better if it was explored in patch quests more and we placed a bigger focus of Zoraal ja. There are a few other little things to nitpick, like that I feel like some of the voice direction was poorly guided in certain scenes-- I liked Wuk Lamat and Erenville for most scenes but yeah there is a few where it comes off as poorly managed rather than actual failings of the actors. And I also really would have liked to see more from Krile in this expansion. But otherwise? This is a breath of fresh air for the setting that was sorely needed and well earned after the events of Endwalker. I would say they're really about even in enjoyment, with both being very good with only really some pacing issues.",1724609260,3,2,positive

76561198031800261,96936,73,english,"It is insane to me that people hate this expansion's story [i]this[/i] much. There are plenty of valid criticisms to make about Dawntrail but the discourse around this expansion is so toxic, it puts me in mind of the way people talk about Star Wars.There are a few key points of contention that make this story so divisive in my opinion (mild spoilers):1. You & the Scions are not the MCs, we play mentor roles instead.- This is a very subjective topic, but for me I am unbothered that we are off to the side. Dawntrail is the beginning of a new story arc for FF14. Having just finished the last decade-long story arc, it makes sense for us to play the part as mentors to the new characters after all we've been through.2. Wuk Lamat is the real MC.- It would be reasonable to say that Wuk Lamat has the absolute most dialogue in the story. Personally, I loved her character arc: it is a typical hero's journey about growing from a relatively weak and ineffectual character to someone worthy of being the MC. I think her arc ends too soon though, and I can see how if you bounced off her character, you would be very unhappy about the amount of screen time she occupies.3. Tonally, Dawntrail swings between highs and lows a lot (and the lows are pretty low).- I would honestly argue that this is the case with every single FF story. Every Final Fantasy has really high emotional peaks in-between long periods of really low energy messing around. Whether or not you are a fan of this style of storytelling is up to you, but I think it is unfair to attribute this to being exclusively an issue with Dawntrail. Even in Endwalker, I can remember long periods of wandering around doing menial tasks despite the universe-ending stakes of that expansion. Dawntrail doesn't even come close to feeling as bad as the low points of Stormblood or A Realm Reborn.There are plenty of other criticisms about the story, but they have been talked about to death. These criticisms are also so toxic and vitriolic I don't find them worthy of acknowledging.Aside from the story, the actual content of Dawntrail is amazing. Square Enix knocked it out of the park for me with the music, zones, dungeons, and trials. Some of this content is in contention to be the best in the game for me; the battle content in particular I think is the best in the game without a doubt. The dungeons and trials really push the limits of what players can achieve within the bounds of ""normal"" difficulty, without feeling painful. The graphics update can really be felt in the zones, dungeons, and trials: they are all filled with a level of visual complexity that wasn't possible in previous expansions on top of being carried by CS3's now top-class art direction. My only gripe with the content is that quest design feels really old still: I can only tolerate being told by NPCs to talk to other NPCs so many times.Dawntrail is excellent on the content alone and an easy recommend if you're already invested in FF14. The story isn't perfect, but I found myself really enjoying it when it was hitting its high points, especially in the final zones. There is also a lot of room for the story to improve, as it's pretty clear that it isn't over. FF14 has a history of delivering exceptional epilogues to even its most poorly received stories. I think the haters have genuinely forgotten how bad it used to be during the Stormblood/ARR days or aren't aware of how good we have it compared to other MMOs.",1724489530,0,2,positive

The problem is the pacing of the story, Wuk Lamet can get annoying at times, and frankly some of the questlines are just poorly written/ended.Pacing of the story: The first half is a SLOG to get through. Don't get me wrong. It does have its interesting times. But you're tasks with running around learning about cultures while you have a cartoon villain try and cause you problems at every turn. And to be honest the villain is the best part. It's comical how little effect he has on anything. The second half comes in and gets very interesting very quickly which was a great change of pace.Wuk Lamet: I won't say a ton since I'm sure other reviews will say way more than I will. But this character is, frankly, very poorly written and gets annoying very quickly. And a lot of the things she says just feel cringy. It hurts to hear sometimes.Questlines: A lot of quests in this just make no sense. They have plot holes to them. Lots of them. People not knowing things when they should (The float you repair is a prime example) and (minor spoilers) there is a large scale attack from a stronger force that happens at one point. Lots of casualties. Later on an attack happens again but it's like it was nothing.Considering the technology scale of the outside force realities to Tuly... it just doesn't make any sense.One other issue I had with this expansion. Proper ambiance and scale of the country. I felt like the amount of people living in the place was probably like 1000 people at best. The main content (dungeons, trials, raids) have been fantastic.

The story itself is fine, the initial idea of the succession contest is a fun way to have someone else in the spotlight. This someone is Wuk Lamat, someone who's been met with some...very mixed reception. I don't mind her, but she's not on the level of the other secondary main characters we've received over the story. And i don't exactly blame people for disliking her since she sticks around the whole story and is typically the addressed npc during quests. Without spoiling anything the story switches to the second plot around halfway through similar to how Endwalker did it, and the second half of Dawntrail is [b]very[/b] good in my personal opinion.

I think this is all a step in the right direction, and I hope that SE allows the team the creative freedom and ability to do more. The MSQ is... contentious. I personally enjoyed it, though I do have issues with some of the writing. My biggest gripe is the fact that several characters didn't get the proper justice. [spoiler] Mainly, this is directed towards how Krile was written. A lot of this is bias because I do believe that Krile was heavily shelved in Endwalker, and this expansion had me excited for more Krile screen time and character development. I feel like its in that area where I was let down with how little we got. This does make me hope for more in the post patches, but I can't help but feel it could've been done a lot more justice in the MSQ.

As someone who had no grasp of the MMO world, how it worked or anything else, I could never have imagined that I would fall in love with a story so much. It helped me and so many others through lockdown, through anxiety and depression and brought me unforgettable memories. I cried, I laughed, I made friends through the way, cleared extremes, savages and tried my hand at ultimates and lots more. The entire MMO from ARR to DT has a lot to offer, with something to do for almost everyone if you know where to look for it. I was looking forward to the new expansion and I did not hope for anything in particular, I did not know what to expect but I did know that after Shadowbringers and Endwalker it would be a hard story to top. As it turns out, the writers of Dawntrail did not try to top it, instead, just like in ARR they set out to create a new story. Instead of returning to the waking sands, we spoke to Wuk Lamat. After saving the world from destruction, it is our time to step back out of the limelight to let other characters develop. While there are some ways in which this maybe could have been approached better I do not believe that the story itself is bad. In fact, the second half really starts to hit hard and once you've finished the MSQ and start on the Raids, they're really truly beeeautiful and beeerilliant. I do not want to spoil anything so will just say that the end of the MSQ once again had me in tears and prompted a name change for my WOL . Something I had been considering for a while anyway and this story cemented it. I cannot wait to see where it will take us and i HOPE it will go where we are all speculating it will, to meracydia to find out what happened with a certain race who found themselves somewhere entirely different. A story happens in chapters and much like ARR and the following expansions led to a culmination of gigantic proportions which still sends goosebumps down my back, I believe that the team working on FFXIV will do a fantastic job.

Most of the dungeon/trial content is fun aside from a few bosses. The story is thankfully better than Stormblood but at times it feels lazy and unengaging. It gets better about halfway through, but there's still parts that feel very predictable and feel more like either a callback to something that's already been done better in prior expansions or is just a trope that you've already seen ten times.My biggest gripe is the amount of moments that were avoidable through common sense, I understand bad things need to happen for the story to be interesting but I get really sick of the WoL standing still while someone gets murdered for the fifth time.The music isn't notable aside from the main combat theme, and the song 'Smile' is straight garbage, I had assumed an annoying youtube advert had started playing and had gotten annoyed sifting through my tabs trying to shut it up.TLDR: Buy it for Pictomancer lmao (And Bakool Ja Ja he's hot)",1724172234,0,0,positive

I'd recommend it with some caveats Mostly comparing it to the last expac, EW, as it's the freshest in mind.Content so far has been better than EW's 6.0/6.05 launch and dungeons are more involved. Fights in the new raid absolutely clear the snoozer that was Pandemonium. If you actually enjoy the gameplay of 14, you'll be super happy with how bosses/mobs are more engaging than they were in EW. Story is a mixed bag. If you're here ONLY for the story, you'll probably rate it lower, but I actually didn't mind it. Not the best, but also not as bad as people make it out to be from my view. Not as good as Endwalker's ending though. Perhaps a bit unfair, but EW/ShB set a high bar DT would always struggle to overcome.Balance/Gameplay mostly fine. Some classes are great, some need help. It's about equal with EW here considering it builds on EW's baseline. It could get better/worse.Hard to rate Dawntrail because we've still got like 2 years of content in the pipeline. ""Mixed"" is a good rating so far: The base 6.0 launch has high highs and low lows. It could get better in time, it could get worse in time. For now I'd give it a 6-7/10.

Dawntrail presents a wonderful slew of new plot threads to follow after many were wrapped up with Endwalker and provides ample breathing room to explore the new worlds and cultures being presented in the expansion in a way EW definitely didn't. As each character becomes more nuanced throughout the story, I find myself thankful for what is left unspoken-- because often in real life we also don't know a person's full motivations. Wuk Lamat's positive attitude and growth reminds me deeply of my little sister, but even then I think she's a fascinating foil to the experienced (and at times jaded) WoL, and an echo of a time long past through our days in A Realm Reborn. I was nervous for this game coming out of Endwalker, which featured a post-patch I thoroughly despised, but Dawntrail was surprisingly refreshing, lighthearted, and fun.",1724129693,3,1,positive

76561198008106517,0,0,english,"[h2]Story:[/h2]To start, I feel it worth mentioning that the previous expansion, Endwalker, was the culmination of eight-or-so years of narrative buildup and a conclusion to the overarching story introduced with the game's re-launch. I mention this in part encouraging anyone who reads this review to approach Dawntrail with healthy expectations, and to (hopefully) add a bit of context to any comparisons you might've heard between it and prior expansions (Endwalker, Shadowbringers, etc). This is a new story, with no prior foundation to build off of. It's fairly lighthearted if not a bit campy at parts, low stakes, and largely independent. While none of that excuses (nor is it intended to be such) the areas in which the story falls flat, I do also believe that its position in the expansion lineup warrants good faith on our part. [h3]The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:[/h3]I have around 7,500 hours logged on steam. I've played this game pretty consistently since Heavensward, and consider myself more-or-less up to date on its story. Much as I insist upon taking this expansion in good faith as its own entity, there are still healhty comparisons to be made between it and one of FFXIV's previous installments.Dawntrail is presented as a reprieve from the events of Endwalker, and goes to great lengths to dissociate from them as a whole—sometimes to an extent of dissonance, feeling like it outright dismisses them. It introduces and focuses heavily on a new set of characters, who either accompany or vie against you. Familiar ones also return, often filling supporting or secondary roles. The premise and structure of its story borrow heavily from the likes of Stormblood: you're called to a far-away land to help another character along their coming-of-age journey, which unfolds in two distinct chapters or parts. Unfortunately, these similarities to Stormblood also extend to its shortcomings too. The story is overly ambitious in its scope, especially for something entirely new, and this comes at a clear cost to its pacing. It's simultaneously a slow burn and jarringly brisk, willing on one hand to take its time to lay foundations and establish characters while on the other beginning and resolving entire arcs in brief. A knock-on effect of this is that certain parts of the story feel under-utilized, worthy of far more run-time but ultimately crunched to fit. Character writing is similarly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from thoughtful and motivating to feeling neglectful, or even shallow and immature. Vocal direction for quite a lot of the cast was all over the place, full of strange or outright bad reads. Don't get me wrong: this review is a recommendation for a reason. At its strongest, the story is a joy to experience... but those moments are often between a lot of stumbling.As a whole, I enjoyed Dawntrail's worldbuilding. The culture and identity of the new continent were a massive focus in the story, and they're presented beautifully. Each of its zones and the many peoples that live within them were fun to explore and unravel, and I couldn't help feeling  rather impressed by the level of detail on display throughout most of them. With that in mind, I also felt like the writers were more than a little gunshy around the darker, grittier aspects of Tural's history and struggles. FFXIV's willingness to delve into tragedy, evil and bitter reality were hallmarks of its previous expansions, and while all are present in this one too, the story has a habit of pulling its punches.Suffice it to say, Dawntrail isn't perfect. I really feel like its story struggled under its own weight, its inconsistencies and shortcomings routinely felt. It spends a lot of its time emphasizing upbeat notes of friendship, unity and togetherness, but seldom does it challenge any of them meaningfully, to a point of feeling almost disney-like at times. Beyond everything I've expressed thus far, though, what'll probably make or break the story for you is its main character: Wuk Lamat. She has easily three times the volume of dialogue than any other character in the story, and is involved in nearly every facet of it from start to finish. Like Lyse in Stormblood, it affords you no room for ambiguity whatsoever; either you'll love her or she'll grate on you. [h3]In other words...[/h3]I enjoyed my time with Dawntrail's MSQ, and would happily recommend it... provided you go into it with the right expectations. It's a fun-yet-flawed and ultimately rather safe experience. While I appreciate what it was trying to do, I can certainly understand why it's been divisively received. The story needed more time and more setup. Given both, it could've been a lot, lot more.As with anything, your mileage may vary. [h2]Mechanics:[/h2]Mechanically, Dawntrail is simultaneously the strongest the game has been in quite a long time and highly illustrative of the game's biggest issues. Most encounters offer a very good balance of complexity and approachability, all while maintaining the same standard of spectacle present throughout most of Endwalker. I'd rate the trials in particular as being some of the best I've seen to date, and I've played a long, long time. Jobs appear to have seen relatively decent improvements, and the devs absolutely nailed the two new ones introduced alongside the expansion. Unfortunately, Dawntrail also introduces combat mechanics that suffer greatly from server latency (though thankfully, they've thus far been contained to two encounters), becoming frustratingly inconsistent at even moderate ping levels. I still feel that jobs retain a prevalent degree of homogeneity, differing in their rotation and throughput moreso than what any one job offers to a group. Your role is your niche, rather than the job you main.Likewise, your experience through content will change dramatically based on the role you choose to main. Tanks (which I say as a tank main) are largely independent in just about any form of group content with proper use of cooldowns, capable of outright soloing the majority of dungeon bosses and even trials past their respective checkpoints.[h2]Technical stuff:[/h2] Graphics, music, spectacle... everything offered in Dawntrail is perhaps the best Final Fantasy has ever seen, and certainly a strong contender even among other MMOs. I could go on and on about how much I love the art direction. Each of its zones are beautiful and distinct. The OST carries on with Endwalker's habit of using regional themes to create interesting and very memorable tracks, admittedly with a few exceptions. As mentioned above, combat looks and feels good. It's a fantastic show of progression, and I sincerely hope they keep it up going into Dawntrail's post MSQ patches. [h2]Controversies:[/h2]Probably getting jestered for this. Oh well. Mock me with free steam points for having an opinion! \o/You may or may not have seen word floating around about controversies involving Wuk Lamat's english voice actress. She's been incredibly vocal on social media about using her position as the voice of the expansion's lead character as a platform to push real-world politics. Sooner or later, something she's said (or the community reaction to the things she's said) will no doubt cross your ear.My advice is to make up your own mind on where you stand regarding such things, to separate the work from the person, and to take everything you hear with a pinch of salt. Sena's thoughts and opinions are her own, not Square's. Enjoy the game for what it is, offer feedback if you feel so inclined, and let Square deal with the rest.[h3]In conclusion...[/h3]Dawntrail is worth picking up. Whether or not you enjoy it as much as I did/do, it's a great show of potential for the future of the game. While I do think the writing team need more time to find their legs, I'm genuinely excited to see where it goes from here.",1724038034,85,14,positive

76561197998757419,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is not as bad as it seems. It came out after Shadowbringers and Endwalker that were fantastic so we got used to really great things and end up being disappointed with Dawntrail which is an okay expansion. Not great but not bad either. It's in the good territory.The main quest is fine. Wuk Lamat is the main character of Dawntrail and obviously you'll see her a lot. I like her, I think she is kind of cute and had some cool moments in the MSQ.Problem is, Wuk Lamat is always there, everytime. Everywhere you go, there she is. When she is not there, the plot is about her. She is overshadowing almost to the extreme every other characters. Everything in Dawntrail's MSQ has Wuk Lamat. You spend 90% of the MSQ speaking with Wuk Lamat.Krile also got the short end of the stick. Even when it was about her and her past, Wuk Lamat had to be there and intervene. Dang, when it was her time to shine and do something, she failed and she got replaced by a blue baby. In the final zone, Krile got her fifteen minutes of fame and then goes back in the shadow being no more than some NPC that follows you like a minion.Same for Erenville. We start to explore a new zone with Erenville and then have to look for something related to Wuk Lamat. In the final zone, Erenville gets some emotional moments but not too much because Wuk Lamat is there and had to say something, be it relevant or not. It felt like the meme with the guy with a vein popping from his forehead whenever Wuk Lamat doesn't talk for 10 seconds.The main antagonists were okay. One is like lizard Zenos but with daddy issues and the other is really nice and cute but made the wrong choices. The final boss fight was great! Until somehow Wuk Lamat manages to come in to motivate the WoL and ends the fight for us. I sighed really hard when I saw Wuk Lamat bargeing in MY fight against the last boss.The Main Story Quest is good if you like Wuk Lamat but if you don't like her, yeah, it's gonna be tough.Combat contents are a step-up from previous expansions. Cool new mechanics and a lot of fun. If you are a story skipper and only enjoy the game for its combat mechanics, you will have a great time in Danwtrail. Graphic update is fantastic. My WoL is even more beautiful than before.Side contents are great too. Many side quests have great lore and some even made me tear up in the final zone. Job quests are mixed. Some are really good, others are boring. The new raids are fantastic and fun and I have high hopes for the alliance raids.And also. Don't play with the english dub. I'm a weeb so I played the whole game with Japanese Audio but I saw some videos with the english dub in Dawntrail and wooooow the english dub is not good. The english voice actor for Wuk Lamat has no energy, no emotions. They either sound robotic or amateur. The memes about Wuk Lamat screaming in lower case are very true.French dub and german dub seem to be good or great though.Anyway, I still recommend it because all in all, I did enjoy Dawntrail. Not as much as the previous expansions, but I had a good time. I believe from this point on, it will only get better unless Squeenix wants to put Wuk Lamat everywhere again.",1723939813,1,0,positive

My speculation to choosing of the voice was to score SE some ESG points. Yes, you can hate my review for stating an obvious fact that is prevalent in the West's ideology. Her overwhelming appearance in the MSQ, the frequent escort and and occasional chase of the NPCs was, the piss poor pacing of story and level progression was awful. I was very hyped to see characters like Krile that left my interest piqued  towards the conclusion of EW to be let down witness a spotlight so dim and taken over again by a piss poor take of a Naruto character, Wuk Lamat once again. Surprised!?  On the positive note. I loved that Yoshi made the  battle content refreshing and engaging. I did not expect DT to beat HW thru EW in terms of story telling by no means. I was just not expecting such a mess of writing and pacing. I have seen a lot of video reviews to defend the story, but even with that, it is undeniable that it could have been done better from their underlying tone.

The Arcadion, our very first Non-Main Quest content, is by far the BEST thing of the expansion. If it continues like this, then surely the Alliance Raids, the Deep Dungeon, the Field Operation, Exploratory Zones and Beastmaster will also be just as good.Now... won why do I think that Dawntrail is WAY inferior to Shadowbringers and Endwalker...I know, I know, it's not 'right' to compare with these two. But you'll have to agree with me that coming to Dawntrail after 4 years of peak storytelling, world building and development is kinda hard to deal with this story.And yes, the big elephant in the room, Wuk Lamat. She is a bad character, she is obnoxious, and the main story focuses on her SO MUCH it becomes tiring eventually.. It also doesn't help that her VA is clearly not as professional as the others.Soundtrack is really good though, except the ending theme 'Smile' which I refuse to comment on how bad and cringe that was.So, a TLDR in case you are still reading:Positives - Combat, Boss Battles, Arcadion, Honey B. Lovely, Soundtrack in most part, Side Content in general.Negatives - Story, Pacing, Wuk Lamat, Lacks development in some characters and in overall is not as good as Shadowbringers and Endwalker.",1723606822,2,0,positive

If the patch content isn't up to Stormblood level, I think this will slip beneath SB in my ranking.As good as the mechanics, classes, and some of the post-MSQ content they've introduced is. The story quality takes off a couple of points and so drops my review to Not Recommended.New review: 5/10------------------------------------------------------------------Haven't found the sixth new zone and the last stretch of the story yet (I've basically just started the level 99 quests), so my review is subject to change, but I've done most of the story and think I've seen enough to review it.I wish Steam had a middling option rather than just thumbs up or down, because that's firmly where I lay...but your opinion on Dawntrail will hinge--as the other reviews have said--entirely on whether or not you like Wuk Lamat.She is this expansion's main character--everything that happens in the story is centered around her, while everyone else is just kinda there in the background. I quite liked her, and she made for some good comedic and heartfelt moments, but I also can very much understand why people *wouldn't* like her. In many ways, she feels like discount Hildebrand, so if you like Hildebrand, you will probably like Wuk Lamat's comedic parts and some of the slapstick involving her.The biggest issue, I think, comes down to the tone of the story and the insistence on including her *in every single step of every single quest, even when she has no reason to be included*. The tone is all over the place here, where serious moments (especially in the last third of the expansion) often give way to weird bits of MCU-style comedy that seem out of place before going back to extreme seriousness. I expected this expansion to be a step down from Shadowbringers/Endwalker in quality and it was exactly as I expected. This was supposed to be a lighter-toned story after the seriousness that was ShB/EW's (and *especially* EW's) existential dread, but while the first half was a somewhat-lighthearted romp with some genuinely good moments (the section involving...let's say your culinary skills...is one of my favorite questlines in FFXIV period, it was very smart writing), the second half gets extremely serious after the terrible ""Western"" section (which I will talk about below) and dives right into EW-tier existentialism which was...jarring...to say the least. But unlike with EW, the expansion is almost too afraid to commit fully to the existentialism, and keeps pulling back with whiplash-inducing intensity when it feels like it's getting too dark.Dawntrail feels very much on par with Stormblood (if Ala Mhigo arc was inspired by HW and Doma arc was inspired by EW), in the fact that you have little bits of good mixed with some bad, and that seems to be a general weakness of the writing team with character-centric storylines. It's a tale of two stories of average quality, which is rough since at least SB had the excellent Doma arc to balance out the terrible (and thankfully much smaller) Ala Mhigo arc. Wuk Lamat is very much DT's Lyse, when the writer is trying to tell us she's Hien...so take that as you will.Overall, I enjoyed it personally, but I think the criticism and ""mixed"" reception is warranted. It's not *as* bad as ARR (or even Stormblood, but not by much), but it's a definite step down in quality from ShB/EW, and though beginning an entirely new arc after Endwalker was *always* gonna be a lower point for the game, and I can see them laying the seeds for the new arc, I do think they could have benefited from tightening up the questline and cutting out some of the padding. The fourth zone in the game and its associated quests (I think it was the late 95-96 level range: the ""Western"" part of the story) is *very* bad, some of the worst story content in all of FFXIV, and I feel that the zone was included purely because they needed to have exactly six new areas and they only had five plotted out.tl;dr: Dawntrail is a mixed bag, with some very high highs and some extremely low lows, and your mileage will vary depending on whether you like the protagonist of this character-centric expansion. Final score: 6.5/10And, just for general context, my rankings for all expacs, best to worst, are as follows:1) Endwalker2) Shadowbringers3) Heavensward4) Dawntrail/Stormblood5) A Realm Reborn",1723434595,1,0,positive

Every dungeon and trial (as of writing this) was incredibly fun, music's still got bangers and the areas were interesting and surprisingly varied. The normal raids in particular were a LOT of fun to go through. (I haven't done extreme/savage thus far.)...So about the story.I'll be honest, I'm part of the group that actually really liked it. Heck, from what I gather, I'm one of the few who actually preferred the first half of the story over the second. It was a really nice time just getting to get acquainted with the local areas and the people that inhabit them. It became pretty clear to me very early on in this half that this was Wuk Lamat's story first and foremost. And because of that, I didn't particularly mind the amount of screentime she got. Different strokes for different folks, but it worked for me. I thought she was really entertaining and seeing her views on her ideals change over the course of that first half was a really nice story. I very much appreciated the comparatively lower stakes and chiller tone. (Also Bakool Ja Ja is hilarious. Shoutouts to Dick Dastardly.)As for the second half, I still like her character, but I do wish that two certain other characters got greater focus starting from the fourth area onwards. In this regard, it started pretty okay. But the story started focusing back on Wuk Lamat quite quickly. Given how central Wuk Lamat's character and relations to the central themes of the story and the antagonistic faction are, I can definitely understand the choice. But regardless I do feel like her role [b]as protagonist[/b] should have ended with the first half, and I sympathise with the people who felt her character was overbearing, even if I don't necessarily agree.In a lot of areas, the story felt like a different take on some core aspects of Stormblood. What with a character besides the Warrior of Light taking up the role of protagonist and the main story being split into essentially two halves covering different areas. And as someone who considers Stormblood to be the weakest [b]expansion[/b] story-wise, I felt like it worked out! Your mileage is definitely going to vary, but as for me, I haven't had as much pure fun with an MSQ's story since 4.1. There's a clear foundation being laid here and I think it will pay off. It's far from a perfect story, and definitely not even close to Shadowbringers or Endwalker in terms of emotional investment and excitement, but regardless I had a lot of fun with it!",1723402066,0,0,positive

I enjoyed the journey just as much as I have in any other expansion. Yes, there are tiers, and I'd probably rank Dawntrail around Stormblood, but I got to see new vistas, had new experiences, and for what I play the game for—the scenery, the ambiance, and spending quality time with my loved ones—it was worth every cent I paid for this expansion, both for myself and one of my loved ones. I have no regrets and look forward to what the game will bring in the future.Breaking things down a bit more, the combat and content scare me a bit since I’m kinda casual. It was tough, and it feels like the difficulty just keeps ramping up. I remember when we all struggled with dodging AOE pools and those obscure mechanics like the Chimera in Cutter’s Cry. These things are child’s play for veterans now that the game has evolved into something much more action-oriented. Jobs like Black Mage suffer most since the pace is so wild that they can’t sit still long enough to get off their best attacks. Bards, Machinists, Dancers, and melee classes shine at this pace, with every skill being hair-trigger and instant. But casters like Black Mage, Red Mage, and Pictomancer really suffer with their long cast times. Healers manage well since, while we’re casters too, we don’t have rotations to worry about.Over the years, the game has gotten faster and much more challenging. For those who love escalating difficulty, there’s plenty to enjoy in Final Fantasy 14. For those who are extremely picky about the story, they might find Dawntrail disappointing, but staying positive is crucial. A roller coaster has ups and downs on purpose—if it was all up, there’d be no moments of relief. Almost everything else, aside from the story, is above reproach, except for some of the wilder grind fests the devs created to keep us subbing and working.What we all need to do is be patient and keep an open mind about the future. Let's be optimistic! Keep enjoying what we love most about the game rather than focusing on its only real downside. That's because it’ll only get better.",1723318691,3,1,positive

However, there's a lot to be disappointed about as well and, if I'm being honest, that's what sticks out the most. The storytelling has always been the main hook for me in 14 and this expansion falls well short of the game's own bar in that regard. The MSQ has an intriguing premise and some great moments peppered throughout, but these elements are wrapped in a tortilla of pacing issues and plot contrivances that bog down any real attempt at storytelling. And, to top it all off, the character writing is just odd. Characters that we've grown to love over the previous decade are hollow facsimiles of themselves, all of their charm stripped away in favor of surface level name recognition. And the new characters are a VERY mixed bag. There are some highlights, but the main new cast just falls flat for me. I don't even hate Wuk Lumat, I'm just disappointed in her portrayal. She could have been a fantastic addition to the main cast, but instead she winds up a shallow, one-dimensional cardboard cutout that takes center stage in every major plot moment. I'm at a loss when trying to recommend this expansion. I will absolutely continue playing the game as the endgame content has me hooked, but I am wary of the direction the writing staff is taking things. With CBU3's history of responding to fan criticism, I'm hoping for another Stormblood moment where the writers take a critically different path moving forward. I don't know how many poor stories the ""story MMO"" can handle.",1723045842,17,5,positive

No, that doesn't seem right...."" to highlight just how much this expac forgets that your character exists and has been really key for 5 expansions running.To summarise, buy for the repeating content and the battles, the fighting and the new environment and graphics update, and try and pretend the story doesn't exist.",1722710138,4,0,positive

Même si Wuk Lamat occupe une place prépondérante dans l'extension, la deuxième partie est, selon moi, excellente et fait avancer l'intrigue générale du lore de FFXIV tout en ouvrant de nouvelles perspectives prometteuses, potentiellement aussi captivantes que Shadowbringers. Cette extension marque le début d'un nouvel arc narratif, il est donc normal qu'elle commence ""doucement"". N'oublions pas que Shadowbringers et Endwalker étaient aussi réussis grâce au contexte qui les précédait.Je comprends la ""haine"" autour du personnage de Wuk Lamat, même si je la trouve exagérée. Je ne pense pas que cela gâche réellement l'histoire que les scénaristes ont voulu nous raconter. Que l'on aime ou non, cela reste subjectif.Passons maintenant aux points FORTS de Dawntrail, qui pour moi incluent TOUT LE RESTE. Les zones sont magnifiques et agréables, les quêtes de classes sont sympathiques (même si elles n'atteindront jamais le niveau de Shadowbringers dans leur contexte), et les musiques sont incroyables. Sincèrement, je trouve que Soken et son équipe se sont surpassés. Les donjons et les défis sont très bons avec une difficulté et des mécaniques intéressantes, et les RAIDS DE L'ARCADION sont EXCELLENTS.En conclusion, malgré une histoire qui peut en rebuter certains, tout le reste de l'extension est superbement travaillé, apportant un certain vent de fraîcheur.

76561198026296553,0,0,english,"I personally didn't care much for the story at first, and ended up skipping cutscenes to get to the the content I generally care about, which is the dungeons and fighting and such, which are admittedly very good. I tend to skip cutscenes in general, however, I have had some thoughts on the story itself that may help others understand why it is structured the way it is.Looking back on it, I think it was the right decision to not have the WoL solve every problem and instead have Wuk Lamat solve them. The whole point of the story is to decide on a new successor for Tuliyollal, and the WoL obviously can't be that, far too busy saving the world and exploring or whatever. But, even if that weren't the case, it would be bad taste to have a foreigner from across the sea come and magically solve all your issues through their own might... Like thats obviously incredibly imperialist messaging for a story that seems to be trying to get an anti-imperialist message across, [spoiler]such as with the whole deal with the Alexandrains[/spoiler].I think the main thing the sours the story for people is how much of it is conveyed through cutscenes. Many people would probably feel like the WoL isn't sitting back on the sidelines if they, as players, weren't also sitting back on the sidelines watching cutscene after cutscene play out. Had more of the story been told outside of cutscenes, I don't think people would have such sour opinions. Take, for instance, a part near the beginning where you are reading the stone pillars to learn a bit about Tuliyollal's history. It could have been handled with interaction points in the world itself, so you would have to physically walk to each one and examine them, which, at the very least, would give the player something to do between examining them, and keep them just the tiniest bit more engaged. Many other cutscenes could have been, and still could be, converted into something similar to this to keep players engaged with the world, instead of just sitting back and doing nothing, but I digress.As for job changes, I've never really been one to mind how ""complex"" or ""high skill ceiling"" a job is since I level them all and just play the ones I personally feel like playing at the time. I believe most of the challenge of the game comes from the encounters rather than the jobs themselves, so making the jobs simpler and the encounters harder seems like a step in the right direction for me. They just need to work on keeping them flexible (e.g. make flare star NOT drop when you switch to ice).In short, the WoL had to be sidelined for the majority of the story in order to keep them from becoming a foreign savior type who shows up and solves all their nations issues. This would be less of an issue if the player weren't also sidelined via excessive amounts of cutscenes. However, combat and especially encounter design seems to be improving for the most part and I look forward to leveling all the jobs to 100 and doing the new encounters.",1722382460,3,2,positive

It's been a really long and action packed experience, and I while I didn't really love it in ARR, I have come to love this world, the characters, and everything else about this game over the course of my playing it. Particularly crafting. God I love crafting.Anyway, the story has been phenomenal, and while I do have my favorites (Shadowbringers, thank you for fully hooking me into this experience like no other), the plot has been progressively growing and growing in importance of what we're doing for several xpacs. I've laughed, I've cried, and I've been blown away by the sheer scope of what we've had to do. And because of that, I'm really happy they toned it down a lot, and gave us something where we're not the focus. We're along on someone else's journey, after having a crazy one of our own. Is it a perfect story? No. Is it a great story? Not particularly. Is it good? Yes. And I'm happy with good. I played with english VA's. I took my time, I walked, I talked, I let myself be fully enveloped in the world, the contest, and while the story was a little generic anime ""with my friends, we can accomplish anything!"" That isn't exactly new for the series.And in my letting myself just kinda go along for the ride, I found myself getting more invested than I probably should have. I've been going through one piece lately, so I've learned to just roll with a lot of stupid silly things and accept it and move on, and that might have helped here in way. I was crying in the last zone very heavily over characters I didn't even get to know very well. Even more so when it was around characters I actually did know. It was a nice neat little story. Nothing amazing and mindblowing, but enjoyable. I still recommend it because overall, it's a worthwhile use of time. If you can just roll with the punches and try to have a good time, you'll enjoy it. I'm hoping there's some build up to using certain plot points in future expansions.",1722322483,0,1,positive

In addition please stop attacking the VA for being Trans the bad pacing and story has nothing to do with them, hell the voice acting itself wasn't even bad. The main issues with the story is that it's following up SHB and EW (an impossible feat already) bad pacing, bad writing and too much of a new potential companion entry that could've been nice but it's pretty ruined now.

While the story was pretty amateurishly written in a lot of places, it stuck to its themes of family and understanding very solidly, had a lot of great and touching character moments, and interesting (but sensible) twists.  Even with some really frustrating scenes where I felt like my character was handled the idiot ball, I kept thinking to myself how much FUN I was having meeting people from all these new cultures and wondering about the lore implications of each new reveal. It was also pretty nice to just be an adventurer again and not have NPCs smooching my character's rear every five seconds just because he smiled in their general direction.The combat content has been hugely improved from EW, too. The new jobs are unique and a lot of fun, and the combat instances have mechanics that kept me on my toes, sometimes even in the monster packs between bosses. Only one dungeon was boring to me, but since it was the lv 99 dungeon at least I won't see it in roulettes very often. The raid series continues to deliver with great combat content and an interesting story with a bombastic WWE-style framing. Each floor has a unique song, too. I've died a LOT and had a great time doing it.I'm really looking forward to seeing what the team delivers for the patch content!",1722159059,16,1,positive

There was always going to be a weaker story for this one, after the dizzying heights of Endwalker and Shadowbringers they need to slow things back down to start us off on a new story and I can understand that a good way to do that is to shift the focus from the WoL who at this point is basically an unstoppable force of nature. So making us more of a guide to someone elses adventure makes sense even if its not the most popular choice. As far as the expansion as a whole goes though, the new graphics update is beautiful, the new areas are stunning and interesting, the new dungeons and fights are challenging and exciting. The story may have its issues but its a far cry from deserving the screaming crying hate mob that seems to have descended lately. Though I dont want to judge everyone who was unhappy the sad truth is the hate seems more politically motivated than people actually judging the product as a whole but I digress.My experience with Dawntrail has been a positive one over all.

76561198123817434,0,0,english,"The expansion as a whole is a 9/10. Unfortunately the main story quests are the absolute weakest part with it being maybe a 4/10 ON ITS OWN. Everything else about the expansion is new and fresh. The new zones, dungeons, trials and extremes are all exciting and have new somewhat experimental mechanics that are fun to learn. The normal raids are where it shines the most. If you're a fan of WWE or anime tournament arcs, then it's worth going through the fetch quest visual novel that is the MSQ. The main story (as much as I enjoyed it in the moment) is a ride through a lot of low risk story beats that feel like beast tribe quests. Our characters take on a mentor role, which I like. We're the Kakashi to Wuk Lamat's Naruto, but my god is it hard to actually sit through her loud and cringey ""i'm gonna be hokage"" declarations. I don't mind her being the main character, but the story focused too much on telling us that she's like Naruto/Midoriya and too little on showing us that we're a badass powerful mentor like Kakashi/Aizawa. The solo story instances don't involve very much gameplay, and in less unique ways than in previous expansions. We stalk a lot more people, fight waves of people, or stalk people while fighting people. This is normal, but compared to something like a certain solo instance in Garlemald we have less to do and it is way less emotionally impactful. I guess what i'm saying is they could have fit a lot more in terms of gameplay like playing as other characters more often even if it's just Wuk Lamat, or showcasing how strong our character is while still making it a mentor moment. With all that said, this expansion is a 9/10 but the msq is a 4/10. It feels like there are more missed or fumbled narrative and gameplay opportunities in the Dawntrail msq than than the entire light and dark saga combined. However, the side content is so good that it pushed me to finally queue into and complete my first two extreme fights and join my FC static to prepare for my first savage raids.",1722044148,1,1,positive

However, it is clear the development team was hard at work formulating the new content, areas, music and themes that went into this expansion. For that reason I give a positive recommendation to the expansion itself. However all the shortcoming fall upon the story, not since stormblood have I skipped the cutscenes this much. With its shoehorning of Wuk Lamat’s character into the spotlight, to the cringe worthy dialogue and delivery by her voice actor; this expansions only problem is quite literally Wuk Lamat’s presence. But all in all, I am looking forward to content to come given the ex trials and raids are probably some of the most fun I’ve seen in this game in a long time. I am more than willing to give Square a pass this time for their exemplary work and let them have the benefit of the doubt that this story can be turned around. My honest opinion is very simple, stop letting the failed band kid that is Hiori direct the story and get literally anyone else from the side quest team a time to shine. Don’t hire a tranny to deliver half baked voice acting that ruins that last stand of the final trial to the point that it’s become a meme. Finally, be faithful to *US* as the main character to get shit done instead of literally playing babysitter to an incompetent Hrothgar that has probably the least compelling character on the entirety of a main cast who’s sheer ideals would run the country into the ground if it wasn’t for her competent brother carrying her at every turn.TLDR; I would’ve unironically rather conquered this continent and spare my character from suffering through a monotonous journey with a shitty tranny VA that made me rather listen to a language I don’t even understand.

Tuve personajes que me gustaron y otros que no, hubieron algunos agujeros en la trama que fueron ignorados para que la narrativa se envolviera en torno a una solución que los escritores tenían planteada.Pero aun así, fue una historia agradable, que me mantuvo enganchado, y que no se sintió alargada a propósito (como fue en múltiples puntos de Endwalker y en el arco de las Hadas de Shadowbringers), y el desarrollo de mundo que entrego Dawntrail me pareció espectacular.Algunas otras cosas notorias que me gustaron, fue el tamaño gigantesco de todas la zonas, el diseño artístico que tomaron para las ultimas zonas, las referencias a cultura Latinoamericana en el nuevo continente, y la expansión de lore para personajes pre-existentes.Lo peor sin duda, fue el tema de el audio. En múltiples escenas del audio en ingles, se escucha como los personajes supuestamente están gritando, pero en su lugar, el actor entrega la linea como si estuvieran hablando muy fuerte en el micrófono.Y lo mejor para el final, las nuevas clases y el contenido de combate: Las dungeons y trials en Dawntrail son excelentes, y después de un decepcionante Endwalker en este aspecto, Dawntrail entrega un buen balance entre desafió y accesibilidad a los jugadores.

76561198393146651,0,0,ukrainian,"Почну з того що граю вже давно і як багато інших полюбила цю гру за її круту історію( хоча для мене ФФ14 це перша онлайн гра, до цього я грала тільки у стаціонарні фіналки, але у 14ту дуже не хотіла йти із-за того що для мене онлайн ігри були незвичні). Також у мене з найулюбленіших це частини Шедоубрінгерс та Ендволкер і після закінчення Ендволкеру я вже не сподівалась що вийде щось потужне(до речі пост-Ендволкер мене якось не дуже зачепив), але Даунтрейл мене здивував. Я бачу що багато людей скаржаться що наш герой вже якийсь другорядний у цій історії, що багато квестів у яких треба говорити з Вук Ламат і це трохи дістає. Але друга частина історії дуже зачепила мене і викликала сльози.Тому залишу плюси та мінуси і деякі рекомендації( сподіваюсь корисні для людей). також мої плюси і мінуси будуть не тільки про історію але і про оновлення графіки загалом.У фіналках взагалі багато тексту і не рекомендую вам пропускати діалоги, ну може тільки якісь маленькі побічні квести( сама іноді так роблю коли вже дуже стомилась читати, але саме основний сюжет краще не пропускати і хоча буває так що здається що у діалозі щось неважливе -краше не треба. Також рекомендую не біжати по сюжету стрімголов і грати повільно, бо деякі люди за 3 дні пробіжались, не відчуваючи сюжету заради того щоб дістати всі ачівки, відкрити усі данжі і ходити-хвастати новою бронею і т.п. Потім ви будете відчувати що історія нудна і що якось усе швидко закінчилось. Знаю, що у кожного у цій грі своя методика і можливо хтось грає тільки заради данжей, пвп і т.п. Але якщо ви хочете саме дізнатись весь лор та історію краще не скіпати нічого. Почнемо з мінусів:- Як і усі мені теж трохи набридли квести де треба поговорити з Вук Ламат, пробігтись на велику дистанцію, повернутись знов назад - але якщо не намагатись робити все за короткий строк то історія відчувається довгою. Я розтягнула все десь на 3 тижні( грала загалом вечорами) тому що намагалась проходити в день трохи головний сюжет та прокачувати деякі класи(особливо нові - Viper та Pictomancer).- Головний персонаж Вук Ламат може здатися вам наївним/поверхневим або занадто емоціональним(але я потім звикла).- Ваш герой тепер у цій частині не головний, а виглядає другорядним але ближче до кінця перетягне більше уваги.- Іноді мені не дуже подобається, що мій герой у деяких ситуаціях не діє, а стоїть на місці та слухає антагоністів по півгодини та наприкінці нічого не робить, але це знайома проблема ще з самого початку гри.- у Солюшн Найн не додали дошку маркета та Inn room( я вже мовчу про те що нема зони з квартирами та домами, але сподіваюсь що у наступних патчах додадуть).- Якщо ви захочете пограти новою расою жінки Hrothgar то будете розчаровані, що замало зачісок( тільки 4 на кожне обличчя). Також чомусь у всіх 4 голів жінки Hrothgar чомусь різні зачіски а хотілось щоб хоча б ці зачіски були доступні на всіх головах.

Мені наприклад сподобалась ротація(на високому рівні) у AST, але не дуже сподобалась нова система карт(раніше було цікавіше). Також додався непоганий швидкий ривок у білого мага. Піктомансер та Вайпер - нові цікаві професії. Піктомансер здається на даний момент один із найсильніших кастерів та й візуально гарний, а вайпер теж візуально круто виглядає(такий швидкий і нестримний), має непогані функції у пвп, але і мінуси теж є( я у пвп не експерт тому краще шукайте на нього відгуки профессіоналів у темі пвп).P.S. Я не претендую на те що ідеально все знаю у цій грі, так як гра англомовна все ж таки + я не фанат важкого контенту хоча іноді можу в нього грати зі своєю Free company(до речі теж англомовною), я більш граю заради задоволення, заради історії.

FFXIV already reached its peak content with Endwalker and to attempt to top that wouldve been even worse than what they did with Dawntrail. Knowing this I fully enjoyed Dawntrail and what they did with the DLC. Is it better than Endwalker? Shadowbringers? Stormblood? No its not!

76561198026757478,0,0,english,"An underrated story whose themes feel like a poignant follow-up to Endwalker. I went in with pretty low expectations given that this expansion was a new start for the plot, with little to build on. I was very pleasantly surprised with just how much they managed to achieve with it. Even post Endwalker, this game shows no signs of easing up on dealing with weighty philosophical themes, continuing to explore them through it's uniquely humanistic writing.As long as you're actually willing to give it a chance, rather than write it out entirely over nitpicks, you should have a good time. Unfortunately, for a lot of the user base, they had already decided the expansion sucked before it even came out. This really isn't an exaggeration, by the way.The bulk of the complaints seem to be about the story's deuteragonist, half of the blame is placed on her dubbed lines, half of it on her writing. The former while admittedly sloppy every now and then, is very clearly just an issue of bad voice directing, but is nearly entirely pinned to the voice actress instead, likely in no small part due to certain hateful beliefs held by many of her critics, which absolutely also motivate a great deal of the hate for the character. The latter, meanwhile is either about her sheer prevalence in the story (something crucial to prevent this from just being some awkwardly outdated white savior story) or about her personality, which really shouldn't be an issue unless you're a cynical husk. Personally, I found her quite endearing from the get go. Imagine if EW had mixed reviews because people thought the loporrits were too silly, even though loporrits being silly is such a small part of not only their time on screen, but also an even smaller part of the rest of the expansion. This is basically what's been happening with Wuk Lamat, somehow.Ironically, if only more players managed to take the themes of this story to heart, the reviews would be far better.Also, Viper is pretty fun.",1721787854,2,1,positive

76561198045964562,73062,159,english,"8/10 (as of 7.0)Dawntrail is a new beginning for ff14, as with the end of endwalker comes a new dawn. Just as ARR had hiccups for having the job of starting a new long story, Dawntrail as well shows the same hiccups along the journey, and while done in a much better way than ARR, falls short of the storytelling that was previously done in shadowbringers or endwalker.StoryThis is probably the aspect that will easily be criticized the most, even for someone like me who still enjoyed the story a ton. Dawntrail's story can be split into 2 parts, and without getting too deep into spoilers, will have your enjoyment of each side, especially the first half, solely on how much you enjoy a certain character, or to be exact, Wuk Lamat. Luckily I did enjoy her presense, but I still felt like the 1st half does having really poor pacing issues and weaker writing in general. I know people didn't like how we are not the main character of this expansion, but from what we have had to deal with for the past expansion, it was a nice change of pace. It still can't be avoided however of how much I wish that 1st half had better writing, cause it took me awhile to start getting into the expansion till like maybe lvl 92 msq. The 2nd half does get better, with a huge shift in tone, but still suffers from the same pacing issues as the 1st half, and writing that not only lacks in certain aspects, but urgency as well. There are a ton of moments that the story wants you to start panicking, only for you to stroll along like you have all the time in the world so you can ""better understand the people"". Of course some of the best moments in this expansion WAS understanding others more, but it still affected the pacing way more than how ff14 pacing usually is. Overall I still feel like Dawntrail was a good overall story, but ranking wise is nowhere near shadowbringers or endwalker, and is probably around the same level of either heavensward or stormblood for me, specifically the x.0 storylines. Still enjoyed it more than ARR and believe it to be a very good story still, but knowing that its the world building expansion, would had liked a bit more better writing now that we have experienced EW and SHB.CharactersSome strong ones, but overall wasn't as strong as previous expansions. The best highlight characters were Krile, Wuk Lamat (her expansion), Erenville, and the other supporting characters such as Koana and The three Ja Ja, but mainly the father and Bakool Ja Ja. Many of the Scions apart from Krile were a bit one note this expansion. We got to experience mainly Alphinaud and Alisaie as they tagged along with us the most, with the other Scions trickling down later on, but they and the rest of the scions (apart from krile again), didn't really experience a character arc this time around. While they do share screen time, Their writing in general felt more of a side treatment compared to previous expansions. They were still prominent, but weren't nearly as strong as before. Even with those complaints, they were still very good, as I really did enjoy Wuk Lamat's character growth throughout the expansion as she realizes her potential as the leader. Krile FINALLY getting the arc she deserves was a treat as well, and Erenville being the main tag along was a ton of joy to experience. Alphinaud and Alisaie still have strong moments throughout the story, albeit not the focus of this expansion. Koana's 1st half story arc was a ton of fun alongside the other contestants, especially Bakool Ja Ja. While the big main villain of this arc wasn't as strong as before, I still understood their reasoning even if I wished they were fleshed out a bit more. I still got teary over some scenes with the characters, even with ones I really didn't expect to cry over, and while the pacing was not that good this time around, still had those highlights that I love from 14's story.GameplayWon't go over the base gameplay, just the new additions, also haven't done the new raid series or anything apart from msq yet. I loved the dungeons and trials this expansion, ESPECIALLY the dungeons as they felt not only challenging for a base msq dungeon, but had great songs and bosses to go alongside. The trials were also a ton of fun not only storywise, but especially mechanically. I am glad they are starting to make the msq encounters more challenging and engaging compared to previous expansions, and I hope they continue along this path. The new (or more enhanced) stealth mechanic this time around was good, of course was just the same as endwalker, but with visual indicators this time. For the new job additions, I played thru with summoner, which quite honestly their new additions this expansion were fine, as they didn't add much apart from solar bahamut, which does feel unique with the AOE heal, but not new enough to change how I do my rotations at all. Thew new jobs however are SO MUCH fun, I have been loving Pictomancer so far, but plan to level up Viper as I enjoy just how fast their rotation is overall. If there is one thing this expansion did the best, it was in the gameplay department.MusicA much different approach to the usual songs we hear from Soken, and my god did he nail the OST for this expansion cause it is GOOOODDD. Many of the zone themes, especially towards the end were so damn good, and I just loved all the new songs that were introduced this expansion. While the ONLY complaint I have is the lack of new songs for scenes like the sad moments, or happy moments (or just a new song whenever the characters just talk about something), but still overall was fantastic as always.Last Positives/Nitpicks-Planning to switch from SMN, as im starting to get a bit annoyed how dead simple their rotation is.- Still loved Wuk Lamat, even with all the complaints- The difference between 1st and 2nd half were jarring, but were tied together much better than how stormblood handled it.ConclusionOverall was a very good expansion for a x.0, especially with how it has to start the world building and a brand new arc. However it still has its faults that prevent it from being as good as it could be. I understand why others feel very mixed about this expansion, as while other departments were improved a ton, the story obviously wasn't as strong as previous expansions. I know that the previous writer has now taken a more back role, so new blood is writing the msq, but I do hope they figure out their tempo and write the patches with much more care than the base msq. Still very good for msq, but would had liked the same writing quality as we had before.8/10",1721688435,1,1,positive

I welcome the developers actually treating us like players who have cleared 4 previous expansions worth of content. Art direction and OST is primo shit as usual, however audio mixing during MSQ cutscenes is hit or miss. Why does Y'shtola sound so much more tinny than the rest of the cast? Wuk Lamat's VA is fine, by the way. I do feel that her VA could stop holding back whenever it's time for a loud, emotional scream or yell, but besides that she delivers a good performance overall. I struggle to believe that people aren't being overly critical of Sena Bryer's performance because she's trans, considering a few right-wing grifters have posted about this game in the past month.The MSQ is pretty good, might have a couple pitfalls, but still solid. I reiterate that the haters must once again be smoking crack when Stormblood is right there and far worse in many respects. Are you really going to tell me Wuk Lamat is a worse protagonist than [i]FUCKING LYSE[/i]??? That aside, the story is a 2-part affair, the first half being what is easily summed up as FFXIV's Shonen Anime Tournament Arc, and the 2nd half a return to some larger stakes that one will find to be more in line with previous expansions. I'm really curious to see where they take the story now in the patches to come, especially given the events of the final area in the story.Overall a very fun expac.

76561197993957474,0,0,english,"I am leaving a positive review, but like many other comments here that would be similar to mine, I have some concessions regarding Dawntrail (and now that I have a bit of time, for any who see this now, here's some elaborations, updated as needed).The Good: The setting, the graphics upgrade, the music, and the fights.  The update was definitely needed (though I know it's not unique to the DLC itself, but still), and the new areas you explore and the mechanics in the fights are really well done.  This definitely shows off well in the later fights, and even when I did the content on a consistent basis, I still needed to put my thinker to work to get past some of the bosses.  Also Soken and the crew who made the tunes for the expac still know what they're doing, as there's no lack of bangers in the zones and fights!The Bad: Inconsistencies and shortcomings, trust parties (just one aspect).  With not saying anything of the story, there are some flaws in the main story that had me raise my brow a little where something is stated, only to be contradicted later on for no reason, while the class quests had things going on that our WoL would have definitely seen coming based on prior experience...just seemed kind of weird and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  Another thing (though it's more a minor gripe) is having some roles in the trusts being filled in odd and inconsistent ways.  I can understand something like in earlier content before the trust system came to be prevalent in ARR and HW, but it feels awkward seeing a certain class healing when it shouldn't.The Inbetween: The story (parts of it), Wuk Lamat and voice acting.  The first half of the story was kind of straightforward and bland-ish, though I was kind of expecting that, with only a couple moments that kind of shocked me.  Later on though in the second half it gets wild, and I really enjoyed it compared to the first half.  And yes, there has to be something for Wuk Lamat.  I've heard things about her voice actor, but I won't open that can-o-worms and just stick to a couple other points of more importance to me.  Wuk Lamat is indeed adorable, and I overall enjoyed her throughout the story, and it was indeed focused around her.  At times later on she seemed very up front when other characters (as well as the now-former scions) should have been able to take the stage again in a more prevalent way.  And while this isn't a big ordeal throughout most of the story, at some points Wuk's voice actor could have done better or needed better direction at very hard hitting points in the story, especially near the end.That's all for now, but this may be edited down the line with future patches.",1721611401,2,0,positive

Yeah, she has a lot of screen time compared to other characters, but I genuily loved her character and how it developted.I believe the ton of negative reviews comes from the fact that everyone wanted another SHB kinda story, I already knew this wasn't going to be like that since it's more like a expansion to have fun here and there, without a world ending event or something like that, so under my perspective, I really loved this expansion story wise, that being of someone that didn't expect something epic of sorts.The gameplay is what takes the cake, the trials/dungeons/raids have a lot of fun mechanics they played with, and I hope they keep the same philosophy on future content, it feels hard but fair at the same time, but overall, it's really fun.",1721586572,2,1,positive

The first half of the MSQ had the road-trip parts of Heavensward and the focus on new cultures of Stormblood - my favourite parts of those expansions - and the second half was amazing for fans of the series with all the FF9 references and twists. The gameplay in the dungeons/trails have improved yet again and are the most fun they've ever been, and the cutscene direction/animation has taken another jump in quality.Unfortunately, I think there's a couple big caveats which explain the mixed reviews. To have a good time with Dawntrail, you'd need to be fine with an ally taking the spotlight (think Lyse in Stormblood) and be OK with a massive drop in stakes. I think if you went into Dawntrail expecting another Shadowbringers or Endwalker you'd be disappointed - this feels way more like a return to the first couple expansions.If you're fine with that, I very much recommend Dawntrail!",1721576495,5,0,positive

 she works just fine.  you don't have to necessarily like it and that's fine, but like, it was plainly obvious barely ten quests into the expack that Wuk Lamat's character arc was about her personal growth and the more i go through it, the more i feel like people just kind of stopped paying attention because she wasn't suffering enough.for the people who are annoyed that Wuk Lamat et al are kind of saturday morning cartoony about the story morals:probably the most valid complaints here.  the expack is a bit heavyhanded, but i feel like it's fine.  it didn't have to be another masterpiece like Shadowbringers, we aren't in the peaks of the Hydaelyn & Zodiark story or anything.  it's a new story and it's okay that it's not blowing your kupo nuts clean off.  i'm an adult, i don't need all my stories to be super dark and mature and brooding.  besides, there [i]is[/i] interesting conflict here.  you look at the intercommunity conflicts inside all the different turali groups and tell me that's not good enough.for the people who are annoyed at ""Speak with Wuk Lamat x 236529375273"":you're her advisor dude. you were literally HIRED TO SPEAK WITH WUK LAMAT.  of course a lot of the expansion is going to be spent talking to her because again, the story [i]revolves around her.[/i]  you've been advancing the entire story up to this point by Speaking with H'uevar Thyfuque and the only reason it's annoying now to people is because it's the same person more often.for the people upset at DT's story being a rehash of previous story arcs and other characters/stories:media literacy is dead.  everyone copies from eachother.  xenophobia, people doing horrible things for sympathetic goals, and [i]characters being focused on[/i] are not unique concepts to one place and time.  sorry you had to find out this way.  if you need what you experience to be completely different from anything you've seen before, go read a manual for some specialised factory machinery or something.for the people who find the sound balancing and voice-acting bad:bad sound design?  literally who?  do you guys not touch your sound settings at all?  everyone sounds fine to me.  honestly the ""worst"" voice-acting i've heard so far were from the Yok Huy, and it's only because i'm fighting a sore throat and listening to people gargle gravel like chunky Listerine was making it worse.  i've always had to adjust [i]every[/i] game's sound settings, no matter how highly its sound balancing is praised.  it's not DT's fault you play your games with /bgm 100 and deafened yourself.  you're a grown ass adult, adjust your damn audio to what you need.also Wuk's VA sounds perfectly fine.  i feel like you guys are more upset about the voice act[i]or[/i] than the voice act[i]ing[/i] and don't wanna just say it out loud.",1721561859,5,0,positive

76561198083446895,0,0,english,"First, to get this out of the way. The narrative and character writing is certainly a disappointing step down from Shadowbringers and Endwalker, if not the rest of the expansions. Most of the comments do a pretty good job explaining why, even if I feel some of the reviews are worded a bit dramatically. There seemed to be major issues with voice acting direction. Even the old characters sounded really off compared to their previous appearances. Sadly, it wasn't just Wuk Lamat.If MSQ was the only thing in this game, I would be let down.That said, everything else, the encounter design, the zones, the music, the graphics and art direction, and the most recent raids, Arcadion. All of these are, no joke, the best I think they have ever been in this game. And that is why I am giving this a positive review. In these respects, the developers went above and beyond. I had lost faith in their ability to create interesting normal content. Since Shadowbringers, jobs have been homogenized, and combat encounters have become boring, for lack of a better word. Though jobs are still homogenized, the devs finally seem committed to bringing some of that uniqueness back in the future, and though I had a lot of doubts, after what I've seen from Dawntrail, with combat that is WAY more engaging then anything in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, the devs have exceeded my expectations. I have become cautiously optimistic that they will deliver with the jobs as well.And one more thing about the writing. The Main Scenario Writer for ARR was Kazutoyo Maehiro. Though the writing was lacking there, after the experience gained and lessons learned, he would go on to write Heavensward, which is largely considered to have been a massive step up, story-wise.The Main Scenario Writers for Stormblood were Banri Oda, and most notably, Natsuko Ishikawa. The writing there was lacking as well, but they were able to find their groove and play on their strengths, with Oda taking on the worldbuilding and lore, While Ishikawa did the Plot, Characters, and most dialogue. They were able to turn things around really quickly in post-Stormblood, giving us some of the best story content the msq has ever seen, writing Shadowbringers and Endwalker (6.0).Likewise, now the writing team has changed again. This is why I think the current story was lacking. It has been a pretty clear pattern, but if the pattern holds, we just need to let the new writers cook and keep the helpful criticism coming, even if their first big expansion was a dud. Athough the msq was disappointing, I'm feeling optimistic about the future of the game for the first time in awhile. We have the most post-patch content scheduled to come out out of all the expansions. The post-game content that has been released so far has been excellent. And the developers have finally gotten their encounter design into gear... It took them long enough.All of this is to say, keep the helpful criticism coming, it'll help the writers and devs in the future. If the patterns of previous expansions hold, the post-patch content and next expansion are going to be bangers.",1721504671,183,6,positive

Overall the story is somewhere between Stormblood and Heavensward for me. It has it's moments but the negatives of the story kinda even it out to be an overall meh story. I was hoping for a Krile and Erenville focused expansion and the Write of Succession comes as a side and not-so important part of it. It wasn't sadly 'till the very end where we get barely anything with them. Characters (only write about characters that I remember from the main MSQ):- Wuk Lamat is a horribly written and horribly voiced character. Her personality and world view can be changed just like Lyse to become a bearable (and sometimes likeable) character BUT they NEED to replace the English VA. You can clearly hear in multiple occasions that the English VA is actually a guy. It completely ruins the immersion. They shouldn't ditch the character just write her better + change the VA to an actual girl. Was forced to change to Japanese just because of her.- Coana is a character that I woudn't expected to like in the end but I was pleasantly surprised. Nice character with a potential to grow. Would love to see him in the Patch MSQ.- Bakool Ja Ja had an expected character turn from being a bad guy to become an ally. The reasoning was very Final Fantasy XIV like so it's nice. Another character that we may see more in the patch stories. Also he earned a meme status.- Krile and Erenville was is the background 'till the last zone. Barely any character development. This expansion was their chance to grow. I only hope that they will in the patch MSQs. Both of the characters deserve to be in the spotlight more (especially Krile).- Sphene was pretty much an ascian-wanna-be character in my eyes. She wanted to save her people no matter what (just like a certain ascian) and was programmed to be successfull no matter the cost (just like a certain ascian). She had potential to be a great villain and they didn't fully explored the possibilities.- Zoraal Ja was an obvious choice to make as a villain. Did his job pretty well.- The other Scions were there just to be there. We could've just cut them and the story wouldn't change at all. - Estinien was also there... for some reason. :/Zones:Every single zone is beautiful. But they feel empty. I really really loved Shaaloani's look and feel and it's clearly expandable.Music:Soken did it again (except one Disney ass song. I am not sure who wrote it but that song was a HUGE miss). As of today, we already have the Arcadion raid available and the music there is phenomenal. All of them are a hit.Misc:- The Dungeons, Trials and the Raids went through a huge improvement and all of them are a 10/10. Except Trial 1 (including extreme) which was a bit weaker than the others but still an excellent fight. People complain about the difficulties of the fights but those peeps are just bad players in general. Not even casuals honestly. Please don't listen to them. 90% of the players are happy with the currently fights.- The New Housing Items are nice.- The Graphics update was a nice surprise. It didn't changed much but it improved where it had to. Can't change a lot on an old engine without a complete overhaul.- AST went through a rework which made the job much more predictable. The ""Astral"" and ""Umbral"" draw's cooldown is still way too long. Instead of 55 seconds, 45 would be much better.- SCH is still my favorite healer. It didn't changed much but the changes were pretty nice. Would recommend SCH over most of the healers.- GNB's got some niiice improvements. Love the Lion Heart combo + the additional Continuation AoE. - MNK is a questionable one. The job in Endwalker was really open for multiple combos. In Dawntrail however, it gotten streamlined. Not a big fan of that, The Beast Chakra Mastery is a nice addition, the Enhanced Riddle of Wing + Riddle of Fire are a great additions. - Black Mage has been a letdown for me. The new ability is really weak, the removal of Paradox during the Ice Phase was a misstake. It's still a fun job but they need to increase the potency of the new ability. - VPR is a new job, great concept, great execution. love the positionals. If you are great with any melees, VPR is going to be a treat!- PCT is the other new job. I am not a fan of it at all, but I see why people like it. It needs a nerf though.Overall:7/10 I hope that the expansion is a 2nd Stormblood (The main MSQ was meh but everyting else is great)",1721466806,4,0,positive

I don't dislike Wuk Lamat, how ever i can see how people dislike being dragged around, while there are other characters they have had joining them for years that are ignored (i also got tired of seeing Wuk Lamat like many others).Overall, the story feels both rushed at parts, as well as dragged out. Sadgeville and Krille got done really bad imo, and the resolution to that was painfully disapointing. There are simply to many instances, that feel odd or out of place, to list a constructive list in a review. It kind of feels like, the current MSQ was intended to be both the MSQ and post MSQ, and got cut up and mutilated to fit.Its still not a terrible introduction story imho, and in terms of value for your money, the combat content is a hard carry for what your getting atm.

76561198014070133,0,0,english,"Hello! I have finished the MSQ and got a taste of most post game content, and as an avid lover of FFIV, I have some opinions. I should point out, I primarily play tanks and healers and tend to get all of them to max level, with select DPS used.PROS:Graphical changes, they look nice on a higher end PC.Most of the new mechanics were a refreshing take on old indicators. It made you have to look more at the boss and environment, meaning knowing your class matters more. I would argue in groups, or if you are blessed with a voice chat based raid group, healers are needed more than ever to make calls on positions and abilities, since I feel like most tanks and DPS look at their feet while playing. Another thing, is the mechanics are repetitious enough that there is no excuse in some of these that people don't identify them after the 8th instance of it occurring. This is a nice increase in difficulty in some places.Healers feel strangely diverse, mostly due to later game content requiring so much healing. I am preferring the White Mage over the other three, but truly loving the Astrologian changes, as it feels like the thought and impact from before matters with each card. I see the complaints that people have, but it genuinely feels like you have to think more about who and when to use a card than draw a card till you get a symbol. Whether you are tossing them on a tank for a buster, or on that DPS that just will not leave the AOE. Scholar is about the same as its been for a bit, and while it sometimes is a struggle to heal up on a Sage, the class always has felt more preparatory than panic-response based. When you know the fight it feels so nice on Sage.Tanks feel diverse in a different way, playing or healing a warrior or paladin is so much easier than the gunbreaker or darkknight. Honestly healing the latter two in any content feels like hell at times, depending on the quality of said tank, and playing as them feels like you need to know the fight better to use your mits well.DPS is hard for me to say. I play SAM, DNC, SMN, and now VPR. Viper feels good, barring some very busy moments, to more boring moments. It has upcoming changes as of this month, and while people are making mountains out of molehills, I am hoping the changes just spread out some of the chaos to make other parts less boring. Samurai feels about the same barring some mild changes that make it just feel less exciting. Dancer is gorgeous with dance of the dawn, and otherwise the rotation feels smoother with some of the 90-100 content for it. Summoner is my only normal class I haven't leveled yet, but hoping it kept the smoothness of endwalker.The story was interesting, and for the most part a pro. I like the main cast this time around. Wuk Lamat was fun, but clearly naive and has growth. Perhaps a bit frustrating at times in the story, or too simplistic, but for the background, it makes sense. The sibling dynamic was interesting. The roles of the characters in part one made sense and the logic about why they were doing what they were doing. Voice acting in English was about what is expected, there was no stunners but for a bunch of unguided voice actors it was manageable. There will be particular gripes in cons. The first part of the story was refreshing, learning about the new land/lore. Incorporating the ideas of food and rituals into subcultures of the greater land. The overall purpose of the story both 1st and 2nd parts were good, but we will discuss my gripes with the 2nd part in cons. The lore and logic additions to how the world works in part 2 make for potentially interesting opportunities for expansions in the future though.CONS:In the story, let me tell you. The first part had the pace, rising action, the stakes, the mini-micro villain. The second, felt forced, or rushed. It felt like some horrible amalgamation of the pacing of stormblood and heavensward.  While the stakes were clear, and there was a clear challenge, and the scope as it was revealed was nice, it was so weird to see them just.... be so inactive or inefficient. The absolute patience the characters had, despite the stakes, was jarring. Most of the cast is battle hardened at this point and flat out know better. Two of the cast members clearly were supposed to have more ties to part 2, but it felt sprinkled into a story that you could remove both of them from, change some lines, made a couple generic NPCs that just were helpful, and overall it would not have impacted anything.Voice acting was about as good as the English voice acting could be. But its time to call out one horrendous mistake in this expansion. Its one thing to fake an accent, its another thing trying to have 10 different voice actors fake it inconsistently. If Wuk Lamat was supposed to be that present or the teams rep of the country, everyone should have listened to her voice lines and recorded theirs after to mirror the accent, or had better guidance. Whoever the main focus is, the voice acting needs to mirror the idea. Not a bunch of people trying to fake a Spanish, mid-american accent. And why do half of the characters in this supposedly recently (last 100 years) isolated country, lack an accent all together, when their parents or children they grew up with in these villages have them?Combat issues: The ""busy"" phases of a couple trials/bosses. With how aoe's work in this game, those busy phases are vile. When half my party isn't lagging but clearly doesn't have the latency I do, I see them getting smacked with damage they really wouldn't have to suffer through with a less chaotic phase. It favors people with flawless internet. The player base. I don't know what happened to you all. Even in endwalker, there was tact, decorum, class. I have had more people rage quit or downright refuse to listen to logic or reason this expansion. I have had tanks that downright refuse to use mits. Healers get so mad at people they won't rez them. There have always been nut cases, but this has gotten downright wild. On occasion this has been an absolute struggle. It takes 5 seconds to say, ""I don't tank/heal, give me some time."" and hopefully you can help them or guide them through the dungeon. But the tact in parties has been disgusting lately. People thinking picto field buffs people that stand in it, people still doubling up dance partners. ITS 2024 PEOPLE. Some things don't work like you want them to and you don't know how they work.Conclusion:The story was alright, just weird in the second half. Flashy and challenging but even for fantasy logic and peoples actions it was a stretch at times.I do think highly of the class additions changes, and hope they just can fine tune viper a bit.I would recommend playing it, as its FFIV and its nice be with friends and just continue adventuring.",1721411377,1,0,positive

However, a consistent theme across both is fun and challenging new content and story themes that will reoccur later. Unfortunately, as I've seen with a lot of other reviews, many have not completed the expansion before leaving a review. You're gonna find that the first half of Dawntrail is primarily character establishment and scenes that aren't all too action-packed. Your enjoyment of the expansion will come through slowly watching characters establish themselves, learning about Tural, or speculation and theorizing. I found the latter to be most enjoyable! There's really two things you need to know before setting in: 1. This expansion is not about you. They did say that this is about the Warrior of Light pretty much going on vacation, so the stakes aren't going to be super high from the outset. 2. Patience. The themeing of this expansion isn't going to be super obvious to you at first, but just like Shadowbringers and grief and Endwalker with despair, you're going to be ending this expansion with taking away something that is beautifully done.3. Don't be too harsh on Wuk Lamat. Some people are annoyed with her character, but she grows a GREAT amount. With that being said, once it hits the emotional moment of 94, the expansion goes crazy. Rush it if you have to get to the good parts, but savor it, it all comes together in a very beautiful way that made my grown ass cry multiple times LOL",1721338797,1,1,positive
76561198096320395,0,0,english,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but since Dawntrail has had very mixed reviews I figured I would write one -- as a WoW veteran who has been playing FFXIV since Shadowbringers. Most of my playtime is real (3,000ish hours as of writing this), I do not AFK overnight in Limsa haha.First things first, I want to get the combat out of the way, because it's the main positive thing I have to say about Dawntrail. I've been a relatively casual player, doing new main patch content on release (MSQ, new dungeons & raids) since I caught up. I used to be a Heroic and occasionally Mythic raider back in my WoW days, but I didn't have the time to take WoW seriously in college so I decided to take a more casual approach to FFXIV, a well-deserved break after spamming Mythic+ instead of doing my homework lol. With that said, Dawntrail's combat has been a great middle ground for me! Others may disagree, but I think Dawntrail's combat so far has been engaging enough to pay attention to avoid dying but also not turn off your brain sort of fights yknow? I've been playing the game long enough to know what most mechanics do just by looking at the boss or the cast-bar, but Dawntrail added more unique mechanics into the mix to spice it up and not be the same type of mechanics that I knew too well. I don't want to go on and on, but the combat is the reason why I ended up upvoting and not downvoting. It took some thought, in all honesty, but I think this expansion is worth it for the fights alone. Especially the raid that just came out!Now, for the story. I will not go into spoilers, just in case anyone reading this wants to attempt to experience any of the previous expansions or this one. One major thing I need to address is that FFXIV usually puts story first, this is a story game at the end of the day and the cool raids are just an extra plus. There is no skip for new expansions, if you skip you are forced to play through the current installment. Just so we're clear, I LOVE the story. I was never a skipper, I read every MSQ up until Dawntrail's release. I do usually skip blue quests but some of them I pay attention to.Dawntrail's main story is basically split into two parts. The first half is about Wuk Lamat's journey to becoming Dawnservant, and the second half is something completely different (to avoid spoiling), like it doesn't even belong in Dawntrail. What's funny though, is that I enjoyed the second half more than the first half. As I said, I skip blue quests, especially tribal quests, because they do not interest me. The first half of Dawntrail felt like a really long tribal questline, something that's usually side content that deep lore enjoyers probably love but most players do not care. That was my issue with Dawntrail, personally, each area felt like a history lesson that you'd get out of side quests shoved into MSQ. Dawntrail is the first expansion in which I have skipped cutscenes within MSQ, and a lot of them... I skimmed through seemingly important dialogue, but a majority of unvoiced cutscenes were skipped. I thank the ""several cutscenes will play in sequence"" warning for making me pay attention when an important event is coming up lol. Important note: For those who would call me a skipper and complain that I cannot speak for people who actually read everything, I watched my friend play through the entire Dawntrail MSQ without skipping. I didn't miss anything, haha.Okay, now for the second half. This is where it got interesting for me. I loved most of the second half, until the final zone. It's hard to speak of the final zone without spoiling, so all I will say is: it was drawn out a LOT. The zone itself was beautiful, WAS (you will know why when you get there), but I heard you can NewGame+ to bring it back so that's fine. As for the story, we're there on urgent matters but the characters pretend we're not and we spent hours exploring instead of stopping the big bad asap. I'm pretty sure I spent almost a whole day in the final zone, and I skipped some dialogue because I wanted to be done. Dawntrail really just makes you want to skip even if you're not a skipper, I'm sorry.The second trial also felt more like a final fight than the third trial (the last one). The second trial is probably my favorite fight in the game, from the music to the mechanics to the boss design. TLDR they were cooking with the second half of Dawntrail and then they had to make it go on and on for more XP or whatever and it made me madge. I would downvote if the fights weren't so fun.",1721334763,1,1,positive

76561198181066145,219285,7878,english,"Final fantasy 14 has always been a sort of thing I return to when im in a really hard stage of my life. It has helped me through some really tough times and for that I am really thankful. I originally stopped playing it after Endwalker as some things happened in the game that made it impossible for me to not get a bad feeling playing it, I always was afraid that that was it, my escape from reality and favorite piece of fiction being unenjoyable for me, but Dawntrail has somehow revived the love I felt for the game twofold.A lot of people really dislike the story and honestly I cant quite see why. Its basically two stories in one and neither felt rushed or out of place, they truely had something for everyone and it changed up its theming often enough to keep you on your feet, while still having lasting characters and storylines that actually made you look forward to what comes next. Not only that, It tackled some really dark themes like death, grieving and mental health issues really well, showing a light to some things I didnt think FFXIV had the balls to touch. Wuk Lamat has been critizised as being one dimentional and a cliche but to be honest I think she was written to be exactly like that, as that is part of her flaws, which she notices and fixes throughout the story. She has a sort of bell-curve development, where she at first thinks her optimism was foolish but then sees with how fucked up the world can be that this sort of optimism is what gives us energy to push through, you just need to know how and when to use that energy and determination. Wuk Learned how to be HERSELF better rather then how to learn to be someone new and someone else, and honestly, with the amount of characters that change completely in the story it fits in pretty well.The other characters I loved as well, i didnt like that Gulool and Bakool had little screentime but for the bit they had, i really liked them. The little side characters that had their short arcs were enjoyable as well, the entire rite of succession was the low-stakes fun adventure we really needed after Endwalker, and what followed was phenominal in its own right, Sphene and Zarool were really really well written in my opinion and going through Living Memory for the first time was something I honestly wasnt prepared for, the fact the music even cuts out and all the people you met in your short stay just... dissolve makes you really think about what is someone. Is it flesh and blood or can it be a machine and memory and is it right to preserve that. Its honestly a really good and also dark thing to think about and the MSQ did a wonderful job doing that. The first half does the fun adventure well, the second half does the more deeper, darker tones well, its a really good combo.Lastly a lot of the gameplay things the expansion added are great, the new jobs are awesome, many of the reworks are super important and the quality of life is great as well. Of course we got an entire graphics overhaul, designed with suggestions by the fanbase, and it looks wonderful. It really makes me hope that FFXIV will stay around longer, we get more quality content like this and that passionate works of art like this can stick around in the bleak era that gaming is in right now.",1721325671,0,0,positive

I won't go so far as to say it's my favourite expansion but it's definitely up there for me competing with Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The story - I loved the story. I love the characters, I think it's an interesting exploration of cultures and areas, of different peoples and I don't care what anybody else says, I like Wuk Lamat. I think she is an interesting character, filled with self doubt that a lot of people can relate to and overcoming it with the help of those around them, I like the competition being between one who thinks only of advancement, one who thinks only of war and one who thinks only of the people and how they could all learn from each other if they tried, and how easy it is to go down the wrong path. I really enjoyed the second half too, I love visiting another shard and seeing where another flood went down, this one a flood of lightning, and the technology they use. The use of souls and preservation of memories is especially interesting especially with today's advancements on AI and could very well be a future people see in 100, 200, 300 years, memories being tracked and uploaded to live forever in a world created just for them on servers. Maybe a bit far fetched, but not inconceivable and that's super interesting to me. The duties themselves are all fantastic, there is difficulty in even the casual dungeons and trails and the new raid is my favourite out of every expansion. I like the new jobs, I like the old job adjustments. Not much was added to the jobs but it didn't need to be, and they feel fantastic. Very good expansion.",1721324420,0,0,positive
76561198076786855,0,0,english,"Best expansion to date. Ignore all the people crying about the story. The story in ff14 has always been EXTREMELY overrated, it's usually 95% filler and 5% substance. I actually thought DT was like 80% filler and 20% substance, which is a big improvement (especially the second half). The dawntrail story was my favorite of any expansion. It didn't try to be super edgy like the previous three instalments, and the plot points and character motivations make a lot more sense (yes there are still plot holes). And it made me cry more than any other expansion. But whether you like the story or hate it, that should have no bearing on your feelings about the expansion overall. The story is such a tiny part of the game that you will only play through once. Even if you hate the story, in every other metric Dawntrail is by far the best expansion they've ever released. It has the best zone design, the best music, the coolest glams (so far), the most interesting fights, the coolest mounts (there's a freaking flying squirrel mount, and the extreme trial mounts are unbelievably cool), and they've said that they're planning for DT to have the most content of any expansion. The first raid tier is the single best raid tier I have ever seen (savage to be seen), and pretty much everyone in duty finder has agreed with that sentiment. tldr Dawntrail is the best expansion they've ever made, ignore the story haters.",1721320749,1,0,positive

D'autant plus que quand je vois des gens comparer la ""méchante"" de l'extension à Emet-Selch alors qu'il a eu quand même x années de développement autour des Asciens et que celle de Dawntrail a eu quelques cinématiques, je ne vois pas en quoi c'est comparable...Bref, je vous conseille de vous faire votre propre avis, et de vous rappeler que les aspects positif d'un jeu ne sont pas nécessairement à considérer comme normal et acquis, il est rare d'avoir une sortie d'extension sans problème de serveur, avec des développeurs qui réagissent très vite sur les problèmes, que ce soit les bugs, ou l'équilibrage des classes. Donc n'écoutez pas les gens qui disent que tout est à jeter juste à cause de Wuk-lamat car c'est de l'ordre de gens capricieux qui ne vous donnent pas un avis complet et objectif (Comme moi, mais que voulez-vous, je sais apprécier les bons côtés de la vie, moi).",1721310378,2,0,positive

And unfortunately i did not. Just think if Naruto, Goku, Asta and Luffy did a fusion dance and the thing that came out was the worst of their qualities. That is what Wuk Lamat is. Just a lame, loud, annoying, unlikable character who pulls off almost as many talk no jutsus as Naruto himself. And i get we are supposed to be backing her, but she legit has no redeeming qualities that a ruler of a NATION would or should have. Another thing i noticed was the very lack of battle scenes in this expansion. It was 30 hours of go there, talk to people about their culture, talk no jutsu them, than on to the next quest. It was very boring and it was almost to the point where i was skipping cut scenes. I get it, this is a new arc so they need to world build but this is nearly as boring as ARR without any of the highs that ARR brought. I also hate how they kinda force her down our throat all the time. When we need to go talk to people ""You're with Wuk Lamat"". When there is a battle cut scene ""You're with Wuk Lamat"". Like forcing her down our throats WILL NOT make us like her any better SE. SE tried to make a lovable, goofy character like Luffy or Naruto and failed miserably. Also Wuk Lamat showing up in her brothers trial was cringy and not needed at all, makes the replay ability go wayy down. Hell i wish we got the chance to defect to the second promise or something. Another thing. Alphinaud and Alisaie. Useless. Why are they here SE? They provide literally nothing substantial to the plot besides to say the most obvious shit ever. They don't move the plot forward at all, you can remove them and the plot would remain the exact same. I thought this was going to be the expansion where we explore SOLO, not with the twins.  I just love how one of the main focal points of this expansion (Krile) barely does anything. Are you serious? where this should have been her time to shine she literally doesn't do anything until the last quests of the expansion. I dont even want to get into the whole shitty tournament thing going on and how i spent like 3 hours with what was glorified beast tribe quests. Or i dont even want to get into Bakool Ja Ja and how his shitty backstory does not explain his actions at all, like if he wanted to make sure all the dead kids werent for nothing, why did he just fucking release that continent destroying bird . His actions do not match the motive, shitty writing SE. All in all, this expansion was a snoozefest with easily one of the worst written main cast characters we have ever had being shoved down our throat constantly for 30 hours. Easily worst than Stormblood, taking stormbloods spot as the second worst expansion so far.Now onto what i do love, i LOVE the graphical updates, good job SE.

All the dungeons and the trails have been really well designed and I would even say it's some of their best fights we've gotten on a long time. The only reason I don't give this expansion a 10/10 is simply cause the story is a bit on the weaker side this time around, and to be honest this was completely expected. After capping off an entire storyline with Endwalker I feel like Dawntrail had little chance of competing with the story. I will say that I enjoyed most of it though, and I think they are testing out how to write there story going forward. If they can do a better job going forward from here then we'll easily have another expansion with story on the same level as Shadowbringers again.

Yes, the story isn't as good as Shadowbringers or even Endwalker, but remember that those two built upon no less than 3 expansions worth of story that came before them. In my opinion, ShB is still peak with Heavensward coming as a close second. I think Dawntrail is better than Stormblood, and if you still enjoyed that one (as I did) you'll enjoy this one too. While I thought the main NPC character, Wuk Lamat, was a bit annoying at first, she grew on me as time went by. The second half of the story picks up the pace quite a bit so if you think the first part is too slow, it gets better I promise.If you're more interested in the actual dungeons and fights, I got good news. With (imho) only one exception, the dungeons are all great and gorgeous looking to boot. The new city hubs are both grand and with good music, so great places to chill in between content. I think the crafting is getting a bit stale as it's pretty much the same as it's always been for the last 4 expansions, but it's still good enough to get the job done.All in all, a good expansion so far. With its happier tone it's a refreshing switch from all the death and horror of Endwalker, and I think that's necessary for the story going forward. The developers has stated that the Hydaelyn vs Zodiark saga is over and a new one is beginning.I'm looking forward to what's coming next.",1721199294,0,0,positive

76561198101509927,0,0,english,"SpoilersDawntrail... Here we go. The new graphics are great and they even fixed some of my major gripes from both of the benchmarks about my WoL. I was pleasantly surprised when I first logged in. The eye movements look so good on the characters. The new zones have stunning landscapes that are breathtaking and foliage density really makes it impressive. I still have no idea why I had so much fun doing random rock climbing excursions. The double dye system is too much power and now I greed for even more. I celebrated when the glamour dresser expanded but with new glamour horizons sacrifices will have to be made to fit it all. Some of those new rewards are going to have me locked in for a while. Looking at you fancy new Wings of Resolve and Ruin. The music. Pure genius that set the tone perfectly for every zone and led my emotions around like the wave under a surfboard I was happy to ride. One dungeon in particular causes me to up the pace almost too much because I'm jamming out and not paying enough attention to the party. This orchestrion gathering is going to be brutal because I'm impatient. The finale song felt a bit out of place compared tbh. The ambient sound design is really well done. I noticed it especially in the new main city and it really helped me immerse myself. The new jobs are great fun but I am partial to viper because balancing the rotation speed with positionals, while dodging new mechanics I'd never seen before, seriously upped the battle high for me. And all jobs got lvl 100 abilities with flashy new vfx so I'm not complaining. As a whole, I definitely had a blast with this expansion. Still wrestling with the desire for world travel it ignited. I did not see that coming. My budget can't handle that. I don't seek out people so suddenly wanting to go meet people from a culture I know nothing about is odd. Increasingly having to tamp down searching out every cave, beach, temple, ancient artwork, waterfall, and weird rock formations that look interesting. The mountains nearby barely cut it. Travel brochures have become dangerous to me, thanks Yoshi P.I for one, greatly enjoyed this expansions story. This story did not rerun a previous expansion to make us do the same old plot lines like so many other games do. Just enough to tie it all together. After being the hero and saving the star, my WoL got the chance to step into a mentorship role. I wasn't sure about the babysitting at first but Gulool Ja Ja offered me a good fight as a bribe. I actually came to quite like the tone shift from always chasing down the problem, to stepping back. With the WoL experience giving them the judgement for when they were needed. After all my WoL has been through, all the lesson's learned, it does the people a disservice to solve all their problems for them. Encouraging others to grow is a difficult balancing act. Teetering between too much or too little aid. I'm so proud of my WoL for guiding Wuk Lamat so well. She was sheltered and naive, but smart enough to recognise this and brave enough to take the steps to correct it. Even when her courage faltered and the self-doubt crept in she learned to trust us over her own fears. This expansion was full of subtleties you have to be paying close attention to or you will miss them. Maybe too subtle at points. For example she only appears to trust you at first but only because she hopes for you to be someone she trusts. There is the trust that someone will keep to their word verses the trust involved when fighting for your life. The deep trust of your fellow scion's is contrasted well with the ever increasing depth of trust Wuk Lamat has for you. Her immediate upset at being called her familial name she gave you permission you use by a certain Queen showcased this, and her growing political awareness by allowing the Queen to use it regardless. An unintended psychological trick on Wuk Lamat's part but one that worked in her favour later. She even proves her growth by taking back a request of her's she gradually realises you cannot accept by the simple fact of learning your WoL nature. I like that she recognises her own inexperience and relied on her brother to make up what she lacks instead of getting a inflated idea of her abilities because of the WoL's aid. Much like ARR you spend time learning about the land and the people in it. As a lore hunter, Dawntrail was full of goodies and hints for me to ponder over. The foundation for this new house has been laid but the design is a mystery. If the dungeon and trial designs are any indication I'm going to have a great time. I had a lot of fun in these fights with some of the new tricks being thrown at us. The neighbours however will never understand why I was cursing at cacti and then switched to cursing at teacups. If you know, you know. I cycled through wonder at the new sights, curiosity about the myriad peoples, and then the contentment in getting to know their ways of life. Also feeling cheated at getting to see the gate but being shuffled away with only the promise of maybe getting to see it later. But as always in this game as soon as the right of succession was decided I was on pins and needles waiting for the hammer to drop. And drop it did. Good old XIV punching us with the tragedy feels. Anyone else see that little child crying over the dead body of his mother? I had to take a breather after seeing that. Sphene could look as sad as she wanted but I had zero forgiveness to give after that massacre and the clear harvesting of some energy from the dead. I almost hissed at my computer whenever my WoL would smile at Sphene in a cutscene and I wanted to give Wuk Lamat a good bonk for liking her. This game had me entirely hooked once more, hating a fictional character so much that I need a break with a punching bag. Meeting her people which just happened to all have devices on their heads? That our people had just been assimilated into? Was literally drowning in suspicion. Souls as currency? There is learning other peoples way of life but not when it involves the souls of your murdered people Lamaty'i. It seemed like they were trying to parallel your WoL story with Emet-Selch but between Wuk Lamat and Sphene. While we didn't need to learn the lesson of irreconcilable differences have nothing to do with the morality or personality of the people involved, Lamaty'i certainly did. So I'll give the writers a pass on that one. Solution Nine still didn't catch my interest because I was far too ready to be the villain and burn the place down. They hinted at it a bit too strongly so the big reveal of them essentially being soul cannibals and wanting to kill us all so they could live fell flat for me. I just wanted to fight already and they drew it out to the point of irritation. That many hints that things weren't as they seemed felt jarringly like being beat over the head for finishing the puzzle early. Uno reverse on on the subtle. The good fight soothed that irritation some. They tried to force sympathy for Sphene was my issue. But the theme of this expansion seems to patience, for both the player and their WoL. The passiveness of the WoL made sense in the right of succession but as soon as you get the possibility that this might be another star endangering event that passiveness clashes badly considering the WoL past experiences. Not the right time for mentoring I'd say. It's not that Sphene is a poorly put together character, I just get repulsed by that personality type. Which is a very very round about way of saying that strong emotional response might actually indicate she's a good character by eliciting such a reaction. Not that I'll admit it. One character did not ruin this expansion for me thankfully. Take that XIV writers I'm getting used to your emotional whiplash. All in all, I'd recommend it. This is just the start of a new journey and theorising what is around the bend is part of the excitement! I can say I got what I came for with Dawntrail. ",1721180158,0,0,positive

Regardless of the story, though, the scenery and fights included in the expansion wasn't bad at all. I really enjoyed exploring the new areas, especially with the new graphics update.

76561198020229553,175340,162,english,"Despite the mixed reception Dawntrail actually surpassed my expectations. Spoilers are inside this and as such read at your own risk but I will do my best to black out spaces. Starting off Dawntrail Follows two Epics in which the story of FFXIV was concluded after years of waiting. To summarize here how I feel about the previous DLCs. A Realm Reborn is where I started playing the game and despite its rocky footing it was something special if a little fetch quest heavy. Heavensward (My Personal Least Favorite) laid foundation for what the game could be but had to ride the dick of the promise to see Ishgard from 1.0. As such it falls short and feels a little out of place but makes up for it in its patches. Stormblood while not received well pulled to story back to focus with the Garlean Empires influence on a global scale and introduced some of the best fights into the game. The Critically acclaimed Shadowbringers and its patches are a masterwork of writing and its bosses are great but differ from Stormblood with more cutscenes within the fights which I personally dislike. Active Time Maneuvers however help to break this jarring change. Endwalker opens strong by pulling almost all threads from previous DLCs and the base game into one narrative. Unfortunately Endwalker falls short with its villain as they feel rushed in like they ran out of ideas. Not to say I don't like it I do its just down with Heavensward for me as I feel it needed more time to be written better. With my personal views on previous DLCs out of the way so you might better understand where I am coming from I think that Dawntrail is the perfect new beginning. The story while simple is perfectly polished and ties itself neatly together. Wuk Lamat seems to be a little hated among the fanbase but I think this is due to the [spoiler]""I get sick on vehicles""[/spoiler] bit that they just repeat for the first half. The joke was not funny at first and was not funny when they last did it. That being said taking a side role for half the DLC as the Warrior of Light is refreshing if not a strange choice. That being said I think this makes Endwalkers Lackluster ending better. From this point forward there will be spoilers as I go in depth. [spoiler] Dawntrail opens after the patches of Endwalker where we traveled to the 13th to help Zero and deal with Golbez. Wuk Lamat whom I will be referring to as Lamaty'i from this point forward seeks our aid in an upcoming tournament to decide her peoples ruler. One of four contestants she has traveled the ocean to seek foreign aid at the behest of a friend. We arrive in Tural and are introduced quickly to its Ruler. A good man who seeks to uphold peace he knows his time is coming and seeks to prove who should rule the throne. A game of trails ensues where we learn of the culture of Tural and its many peoples. The wars it has gone through and how it has impacted the lives of the contestants. As the contestants learn of their people they grow in a way that befits rulers excluding one. The true son of the king bent on bringing war sticks true to his path. [/spoiler][spoiler] Through many tests Wuk Lamat and eventually her adopted brother learn to work together and he drops out of the race to help her to win. The head strong rival a non heir to the throne even concedes that Wuk Lamat is best fit. Suprise suprise with the help of Azem she wins and is crowned the Vow of Resolve and chooses her adopted brother to be the Vow of Reason to rule alongside her. The true son to the king bitter by his defeat steals the key to the prize of the contest and enters before we can. A portal to what was likely the twelth gives way to an advanced civilization which eats aether to sustain itself after its calamity. Becoming its king the true son attacks Tural and starts the war he wanted in the first place. [/spoiler][spoiler] As Azem we push to the front lines to assist and learn of its many people as is our duty as a member of the convocation. Choosing to stop the war and eventually save the source we take down the leaders of this civilization before they can do the same to us dooming them to their original fate in order to save our realm. [/spoiler]As far as the story goes I like it alot. It shows us what our role in Ascian society would have been and gives more insight into what issues they caused. If I had to guess what will occur next I would say one of two things is possible. We are either going to go and check out the landing place of the dragons Meracydia and learn what is left to learn on our realm or we are going to head to the 4th, 8th, 9th or 11th shard like we did with the 1st. It is our job to see everything and understand as many cultures as possible. If I had to give Dawntrail an overall theme it would be the Acceptance of Loss and Moving Forward. Next I would like to go over gameplay changes. While I am not well versed in all classes or content I will give my best based on how I usually play. Before this DLC I mained the following Classes. Tank: Paladin, WarriorDps: Samurai, Dancer, SummonerHealer: Sage (Don't play it much though)After this DLC this has changed to this. Tank: WarriorDPS: Samurai, PictomancerHealer: None Before beating this DLC I got 7 Classes to level 100 easily. Leveling up did not take long outside of the first day when I picked up Pictomancer. The New Classes Pictomancer and Viper are welcome additions however of the two Pictomancer stands out. When it was not Green Mage I was a little disappointed and from trailers I thought I would hate it but it is some of the most fun I have had with damage comparable to Blackmage in Stormblood. Viper on the other hand feels lack luster which is a shame as I have been waiting for another Sword DPS for a long time. There is nothing wrong with it but there is not anything right about it either. Its okay. At the time of writing this though I am only Level 96 with it so if they suddenly get better in 4 levels I might change my opinion. Dungeons fucked this DLC. All of the dungeons are good including the post game content ones with one of the post game ones being my favorite in the whole game. Trials are hard as fuck. Something that changed this dlc in comparison to the last few is the speed of combat in instances. Dungeons now have bosses that hit hard and quick giving you little reaction time. Zeromus was fast before but all things in this DLC outclass his speed with some fights even feeling like Savage content. With this change though they introduced a warning system to alert you the first time something is about to happen. You are also punished harder for ignoring mechanics by any means including through Rez and knock back resistances. Role Quests which is a mechanic I hated when introduced but grew to like by the end of Shadowbringers are ruined by this DLC as they take the piss out of them for a joke storyline. Think Hildabrand level of stupid shit but tie it to finishing the dlc instead of being side content you can choose to skip. Dawntrail is a solid 9 for sure.",1721112343,0,0,positive

The dungeons, trials, new classes and new class actions are all up to quality so I won't be arguing about those things. Story is a mixed bag for me. I don't judge it as harshly as a lot of people have but I won't try to beat around the bush. The story is weaker than the last expansion but that isn't really fair to discount it. Endwalker was the payoff and climax of over ten years of storytelling. Dawntrail is the start of something new. So I kind of went in expecting it to not be quite as big. I'll say that the first half of the story was jarring to me, I actually had trouble going through it for a bit. I felt like the big event of the first half was rushed with not enough I guess challenge for the character it centers around. I felt like the villains of that arc were a bit too easily folded. The second half of the story was where I really enjoyed it. I liked the new world we got introduced to and the characters we met. The villains felt better than the ones from the first part though I know people will be arguing about what happened for a while.

The new classes are great, picto is fun with big damage and viper is my new favorite melee dps. If you want One Piece with a bit of sci-fi craziness I would recommend this expansion full sale. If you want to wait for a sale that is cool too, but go in with your own opinions as of course everyone has their likes and dislikes.",1721081417,1,1,positive

[h1]Story[/h1]Tbf, the story is kinda ""talk to Wuk Lamat"" for like 100 times and more a movie with plotholes than a game, but Endwalker had more cutscenes, just saying.For me personally, the story was mid at best, the first part was enjoyable, but also avoidable at all points. The second part felt rushed and the villian was terribly written tbh. The whole situation was just unneccessary, rushed and the end was underwhelming imo. I'm honestly tired, [spoiler]that villians in FFXIV change their minds after we defeated them.[/spoiler]But, in the end, the characters were fine (at least for me) and I never felt like wanting to skip a cutscene. [h1]New stuff[/h1]Like I said, an expansion offers more than just a new story chapter. - 2 new classes (2 DPS, Picto is fun, Viper is less fun in lower level range), both are unique in their playstyle- new dungeons (I felt like they raised the difficulty for all dungeons, in the newer ones, both healer and tank need to know their stuff, otherwise it's a wipe when pulling wall-to-wall). - new trials (they are rough, especially the last one)- new environments (they look great and unique, but feel empty sometimes tbh)-  new gearsets (they look fantastic)[h1]graphics update[/h1]Another huge point of DT release was the graphics update. Mostly lighting got fixed and we have new textures here and there. The game doesn't look as fantastic as Cyberpunk, but that was never the point, so nothing to complain here either.[h1]content patches[/h1]Y'all should also not forget, that we now get (at least) 2 years of free content patches, including relic weapon, tribes, new trials, new dungeons, ally raids, normal raids, savage content, and more. [b]TLDR:[/b] Story aside, the new content is great so far. Graphics got a huge update, the new dungeons and trials are well made and the normals raids will be released soon.

76561198063750560,0,0,english,"Where to begin with this review. Let me just stress that if you're trying out ffxiv, play the trial up to and including Stormblood. If ARR/HW hasn't caught you in story and Stormblood hasn't entertained you with gameplay. this review isn't even worth considering. If you're sticking around, then expect Dawntrail to be more of a Stormblood-like expansion. It's certainly larger, prettier and more interesting. TLDR; Dawntrail is an easy 9.0 from me.The good: Every zone has a story, looks amazing and there is something interesting going on. There are various stories to follow, plenty to keep you interested and lots of growth happening. It's happy good times. Until it's not, and then things are badass. The story essentially cuts into two chapters, both of them could have been an expansion in it's own right, but by compressing them together like this it's a coherent story which almost doesn't overstay it's welcome. The dungeons are phenomenal spectacles of vista's, with interesting mechanics and good looking drops. The trials test your mettle and prove to be great story beats as well.The bad: Talk 3 three people, and then speak with Wuk Lamat again. Even though she's story centric, i'd love to have ditched her once or twice in favour of Erenville, Krile or the 4th promise. She overstays her welcome, and as other critics have pointed out, the voice acting misses a beat here or there, and because this happens in pivotal moments, it feels like the difference is rather stark between the EN and JP localizations. That said, if you take regular breaks from the story, Wuk doesn't become too overbearing. Since a few days after finishing the story, I look back fondly on the adventure there was. And that rather ebbs away the critic I had for Wuk as well.What remains then is a cool adventure in new lands. In my opinion, Shadowbringers and Endwalker shined because ARR, HW and StB setup an amazing story and they could land it. Dawntrail has to stand on it's own legs much more, this causes you to dig through a lot of setup before you go anywhere. This can be rewarded in future expansions, so whilst it affects the pace of the story, it breeds potential. The story sets up a few new hints at potential arcs of what can potentially come.",1721029140,0,0,positive

For some it'll be an ideal break from the themes of grief, loss and the god killing spree we went through in Endwalker, now having the chance to go out for some fresh low risk fun adventures in a new land while mentoring Wuk Lamat in her rites; but for others who crave the fanfare of being the main character in grand god killing adventures, this will feel like a boring trudge through mud, specially because [u]DT at its core is about Wuk Lamat, family, respect and love (and those can't be developed with rushed in new characters).[/u][b]This being a new story will make it or break it for many:[/b] If you dislike the new introduced characters, you will likely be bored of the rest of the game bc we aren't in the main spotlight and neither is this story about the Scions who joining us, but if you loved the new characters? You'll enjoy seeing them grow and get stronger with your help.If the second half of the game doesn't hook you in with its twists? Then you'll most likely be left with little of interest for anything upcoming since this isn't about our already established ascians anymore, and this plot is still on it's baby steps and unfolding as the first chapter of a new saga.Do I recommend this expansion? Yes! Will it be for everyone? Depends on what they want from it, so no.Personally, I'd say Dawntrail isn't your [i]""oh it's like ShB, the best expac where everything is good and 100% guaranteed you'll like almost all aspects of it bc it's so different from the previous expacs"".[/i] DT is a ""feels good like comfort food"" type of expansion that to me felt like a fresh breeze after all the doom and near universe end from Endwalker. This feels like it's a good starting point for the story that will be unfolding into interesting paths.Regardless of how I might feel about the characters or main story though, I have to commend the whole creative and research teams. The new zones are incredibly beautiful, the respect, research and love poured into it can be seen from all of the details and references to all North, Central and South Americas, and it can be felt. The gameplay mechanics have been upped for the trials and dungeon bosses, and it's been A LOT of fun running around trying to figure these new things out (and dying along every new person trying to figure these out too).",1721027275,0,0,positive

Is it to the level of the best of the best this game had in its ten years? Not really but the ""Smile"" arc is by no mean bad, by the end of the expansion I had mostly memory holed most of the ""Dawntrail"" arc and I had forgiven altogether how bad those first 20h wereIt deserves its mixed review score, the questline was extremely long and despites a lot of QoL, it was reminescent of how sluggish ARR felt at times, its lack of mostly any encounters and a boring story about what another review called ""a very long tribe quest"" warrants more than enough such a lower score compared to the other expansions, Tural is by no mean a bad place, I enjoyed a lot of its lore and some of the tribes were interesting but like an anchor preventing ships from leaving port, Wuk Lamat's bad writing prevented anything good to truly come out of it, even more emphasized when every issue is solved by a glorified ""we can be friends""The last 10h of the game were rejuvenating to say the least, if some of it was still REALLY long, it was significantly more meaningful than anything done in the other 2/3 of the expansion, I must conceed this however, the ""Dawntrail"" arc fit extremely well for the end of the ""Smile"" arc and did not feel all in all entirely wasted, even Wuk Lamat believe it or not""Dawntrail"" arc? 2/10, entirely deserves to be crowned ""Worse than A Realm Reborn"", please don't bring up Wuk Lamat near me I will cry""Smile"" arc? 8/10, the real meat of this expansion, filled with enjoyable and great content that unlike the rest would be to my eyes immensely memorable, if it wasn't for the first 60 quests it would place well above Stormblood in my opinionConclusion?

I enjoyed it, but it was a story that got better overtime. That isn't to say that the early hours were bad, but I much more enjoyed the later half of the story. Wuk Lamat was alright as a character. Given the plot, it makes sense that she'd get a lot of attention. I just don't have too strong of a opinion on her. I was more interested in Krile's story in the expansion and I was happy with how they fleshed out her backstory and character.The first arc of the story was straight forward, if not predictable. To be fair its one of those story arcs with an ending you can see from a mile away. However, there were some surprises that I enjoyed throughout it. I'm unsure if this was just me, but the second arc of the story felt ""faster."" Despite that, I'll probably remember it more than the first half. At first, I was unsure of the different direction, but I quite liked where it went. It was satisfying to play through from beginning to end.[spoiler]When Yoshi P said to do the Aloalo island content before Dawntrail, I didn't see much of a connection except maybe one or two references to it in the first half.

However, the delivery of some lines in key moments felt flat or out of place and it took away some of my emotional attachment to the story when it could've added so much more depth (think of that incredible Lina moment in Shadowbringers with all the emotions the VA delivered, it's what I'm referring to).Finally, while this can seem nitpicky from my part, the main voiced track just felt out of place and didn't click with me at all. I wish it did because FFXIV OST is one of the best aspects of the game for me, but it just didn't and it also took some emotional attachment away from the scenes and ending. The OST in general is really nice, though and I'm looking forward to have it officially released!So I recommend the expansion because even if I have issues with all the points I mentioned above, the dungeons and trials are amazing and there's room for a lot of fun and engaging gameplay after finishing MSQ and the story in general is nice, just not great. I'm looking forward to patch content.P.S.: SE, please think about reverting some key changes that took away all the fun EW BLM had! The changes aimed to kill non standard made standard really clunky as a result, at the same time raising the skill floor and lowering the ceiling. This takes a lot of the complexity away from the job and overall standardization is terrible, let the jobs have personality and specific requirements.",1720896429,1,0,positive

Like ARR, Heavensward and Stormblood, you are playing a part in someone elses story. If you hated ARR, Heavensward and Stormblood's story then Dawntrail is unlikely to appeal to you. However if those expansions did work for you, great! Dawntrail is much more refined and polished than any of those three. Is Dawntrail as good as Endwalker? No, of course not, Endwalker was the satisfying conclusion to ten years of build up, Dawntrail never stood a chance, but it is a great starting point for wherever the devs decide to take the story next.As for the battle content, Dawntrail absolutely excels.

76561197989082217,0,0,english,"I was surprised to hear this expansion is getting mixed reviews, and from what I gather it's mostly about one character that has a big presence in this expansion not being liked much. I am reminded of how many people did not enjoy another character from the Stormblood expansion. It is bewildering to me that this would be enough, but then again I enjoyed the character and their growth throughout the expansion. I understand that the fact that the player character is taking more of a supportive role in this new story rather than being the main character. It would be fair to say that this time the main character is Wuk Lamat and I understand how it might upset some people. But to the point of not recommending the whole expansion? I find that bewildering.Personally, I decided I loved the expansion at the level 95 dungeon. Though I was annoyed at some of the story. If you could divide the story into three parts, I would say that the middle one was a bit weak. But it picks back up by the end and finishes nicely. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling anything.More than anything, there is a richness in the world which is expended drastically in that expansion. The environments are beautiful and some of the music is breathtaking. As some of the latest expansion, it tackles themes that are o so interesting to me. While some of the great stakes and themes are similar to those previously presented, they are seen from a different point of view or at least offered with a different enough presentation to feel fresh and worthwhile to think about.The music is simply amazing, as ever with this game. The combat, though I wish SquareEnix would bring back more responsibility regarding tanks and positioning the enemies, is great, some of the changes to classes are much welcome and the difficult fights so far have been enjoyable.All in all, I can hardly fathom talking to someone about this expansion and hearing them say they hated it. Mostly, someone might disappointed about something might have been handled, but everyone in my FC have thoroughly enjoyed DT and so have I.If I have one complain that I agree with a lot of people on here, it's that the villains' motivations are not as clear as they should have been, or take time to come into view. It could have been done better, agreed.But overall, I have to voice my opinion, the game's good.",1720788434,2,0,positive

The second part of the expansion was fantastic, but she always had to be there with the fucking power of ""loving eachother""... Even in the final trial they managed to force us to recede because someway she had to come and resolve a situation that basically we already resolved. It was nice seeing her in the first part, but I think it was more fitting for her to go out of the main spot after she became dawnservant; having her in the second part was useful only to put in the shadows all the other characters, like Krile and Erenville that without her could have been explored better instead of having their entire personal motivations resolved in 2 quests each.END OF SPOILER AND PERSONAL RANTExcluding the terrible pain of having the story of an entire expansion ruined by a Naruto, the rest of the expansion is really good.- Some of the best combat content we have seen since HW- The graphic update really made the new zones something wonderful- The 2 new classes are quite fun to play and the other classes are still good (for me)- Music on top as always-  Even fate bosses are goodBut still, even with everything else so well made...

The new characters are charming and intriguing and the settings of the new zones are highly interesting. The music is - as always - S tier! The new dungeons are fantastic and bring new mechanics and refreshing spins on existing mechanics (pun intended ;) ). Some of the fights in the MSQ are surprisingly challenging in all the good ways: No unfair mechanics or tedious dragging out past their welcome. It's always nice to return to FF14 and have a quality game waiting for me.There are some issues imo but they do not warrent a thumbs down! The story suffers from a pacing issue but I go against the grain and will say that it's not slow enough. Hear me out. (And mild, story beads hinting spoiler ahead.)There are ideas and character development that could have been expended out further in the first half of the MSQ to flesh out the world and the villains. My impression was that unfortunately Dawntrail suffers from being in the shadow of the gargantuan world-ending threats Endwalker introduced and overcame and the writing in this expansion seems to feel the need to escalate the stakes to a slightly less but still world-ending level in order to measure up to its predecessor expansions. I would have welcomed a purely political-drama expansion campaign as the promised/memed ""vacation expansion"" that gives the cast their due time to shine and develop with the hint of the upcoming threat to our world at the very end as a cliffhanger to be picked up in the patches and the next expansion.",1720773686,0,0,positive
76561198105453903,0,0,english,"I went into this new expansion/saga fully expecting it to be a slow start. New dangers and threats mean you're basically putting a hard reset of the high stakes.Looking back on realm reborn, I only turned to this game because another MMO basically burnt me out, and despite ARR's rather dull story, I was still captivated enough to try something entirely different with a completely change of pace in a new world.Coming hot off the heels of Endwalker where all of creation is at stake, trying to sell an expansion on the idea of it being a holiday is hard, but to CBU3's credit, they've yet to fully let me down and make me hate a game, so I played it.From start to finish, I rode the waves of the story, and let things play out...And I loved it. All of it. The change of pace was a refreshing. For this story you are no longer the main character, you get to sit back and let someone else go through growth in their rise to be the Dawnservant (Basically the king and/or queen of the land).You watch them go forth with some pretty lofty ideals and despite the resistances they meet, things workout... whilst also competing alongside an interesting villain type and a rather cookie cutter villain type.Without spoiling anything further, I will just say I love how this story developed, how it continued to surprise me and keep me wondering. The carrot on the stick effect of finding the golden city was a joy.Now if you're going into this expecting the stakes to continuously get higher despite saving the entirety of creation in the previous expansion... just slow down, you cannot get higher stakes than that, things need to cool down or the entire series may as well have ended in 7.0I liked that things slowed down and we got to ramp things up again, it was almost nostalgic to encounter a villain that had similar ideals to the main villain of ARR and I think this was a deliberate choice narratively.So yes, I recommend this wholeheartedly.Also yes I know Wuk Lamat is a little annoying at times, she's basically a kid trying to wear big adult shoes.

76561198119570427,136819,1186,english,"So, I love FFXIV. I pour thousands of hours into this game, and even got a hand-sized tattoo related to a previous expansion done on my back - which is saying something considering it is only the third I've ever gotten done and by far the largest of the three. I would have preferred to give a neutral review than either ""Yes"" or ""No"" and I debated which to select for a long time, but I decided to give the expansion the benefit of the doubt. All things considered, it may be one of the least impressively written storylines in FFXIV, but it's still much better than most video game storylines (and especially MMO storylines).I actually like Wuk Lamat, and was excited to see where this adventure would take us and her. I was thrilled by the prospect of a more relaxed adventure full of discovery and excitement, and an opportunity to bring my WoL back to her roots as a thrill and culture-seeking explorer, searching for new worlds and new experiences for the fun and joy of it. I won't deny that some of this did happen! We learnt a lot about new cultures and races never before seen and even got a cool friendly sparring match with a very cool new character. They did sort-of succeed in giving us a kind of ""cultural vacation-y"" vibe in the first bit, but it was wrought by the burden of participating in high-stakes political struggle which just goes to show that less is sometimes more.A lot of people have already commented on how it felt more like a ""Babysit Wuk Lamat"" adventure, that her confidence grew but not her capabilities, and that other characters' personalities and ability to have an opinion in any matter got pushed to the side because ""Wuk Lamat has to do this and be cool and save her people"" - which I agree with save for one private moment near the end with G'raha Tia, which was painfully obviously written by someone else. So I will touch on a few other things that bothered me about this expansion. Heavy spoiler warning ahead, though I will do my best to censor much of it. I will split the story into 2 main plot segments - A and B. 1. While plot segment A was fun and engaging in my opinion, mainly because I loved the cultural introductions to the new races and societies (and their primary characters), it felt stretched out and took way too long, and at several parts, even someone like me who has done every single yellow sidequest in the game felt bored at times. I understand that they needed to take time to build the new world and build the new world they did - VERY thoroughly. But several of those moments of faffing about and clicking nameless NPCs and items could have been cut down and still had the same impact, and we would have finished those quests in 2-3 levels rather than 5. By making plot segment A stretch out this long, the much more complicated, high-stakes end of Dawntrail could have been hashed out better, which brings me to:2. Plot segment B felt extremely rushed - like they tried to cram the entirety of Shadowbringers into 4 levels with most of the lore and emotion-intensive parts shoved right to the end. The character we faced in the ultimate battle felt like they had potential as both a misguided anti-hero and villain, but because they didn't have many opportunities to take centre stage and were completely denied any chance to properly explain themselves save for a couple of relatively unemotional explanations of the past, they ended up feeling like a poorly hashed-out antipathetic/unsympathetic Emet Selch and Meteion hate-child. 3. There was a significant ethical conundrum explored near the end - a topic that has resonated throughout history in literature and pop culture was attempted to be brought to light. Except, how it was handled, in my opinion, was loathsomely disappointing and a terrible way to end the already disappointing expansion. This is especially felt since a similar topic had been handled far better just one expansion ago. It left me more angered at the resulting poorly executed visual effect, the utter lack of sensitivity, the identical quest structures in each zone, and the rushed cramming-in of otherwise fascinating plot points with heavy implications than stirred or morally ""educated"" by the story. It is so painfully obvious that they are trying to teach us, adult players with real-life knowledge and experiences, how to handle one of the sadder experiences in life as they quite literally spell it out - which would be somewhat fine if it was also not done as insensitively and forcefully as it was, with the writers smiling and cheating their way out of exploring any realistic conflict or emotions. Either way, I hope the post-expansion quests improve upon these issues and give us the story we really wanted.",1720765920,2,0,positive

It should be noted, that I went into this expansion not expecting it to be like Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but rather more akin to A Realm Reborn. In my mind, the first entry in the new saga and follow up to Endwalker was never going to be on that same level since it is the start of something new. The dungeons, trials, and first raids have been some of the most enjoyable ones that I've experienced with my time in the game. And the last two zones in particular have been some of my favorites. However, I think the flaw with this expansion is that it feels like two stories are happening. Without getting into spoilers, the first four zones feel like their own story and entails your journey through the competition that you were brought here for. The last two zones kinda come out of nowhere and feel vastly different than the other two thirds of the expansion. What I would have preferred is a more fleshed out story with the competition and power struggle for this new area. I'm fine with not being the ""main hero"" as long as the story overall is still good. That being said it is weird that no one talks about how you are literally the savior of the entire world. (What were the people in Tural doing during Endwalker? The entire world was being threatened not just the known world.)And as much as I loved the final third (mostly due to the references to a particular Final Fantasy, the last zone being probably my favorite zone in the entire game), I think I would have preferred if it was saved and made a focal point for it's own expansion (something more like Shadowbringers). This would have allowed characters like Wuk Lamat, Zorral Ja, and Bakool Ja Ja to be more fleshed out. Having the story revolve around a power struggle could have been much better and a compelling way to introduce this new continent. That being said, for what it was, I didn't mind the story and rather enjoyed many parts of it. But I will still acknowledge that it could have been better. While it didn't take away my enjoyment of the game, it definitely can for some people, especially if you are solely playing for the story.Ultimately, I think this is a great expansion with some of the best gameplay that FF14 has had and while the story has been a rocky start, it introduces a lot of possibilities for where they can take it. Unfortunately this means that it will most likely end up as ARR 2 for most people: a story that people will rush through to get to the good stuff afterwards. All that said, I would still recommend this expansion purely due to the new dungeons, trials, raids (so far), and jobs added into the game. I'm looking forward to the content that is added with the post-patch as what's already been announced and may update this review once it all finally comes out, but I still believe that this expansion has something for everyone and would still recommend it.",1720753238,1,0,positive

76561198041019937,570747,2235,english,"Overall, a B- expansion to an A+ game.Dawntrail is broadly as good as (and in many regards better than) Heavensward and Stormblood, but will likely be remembered as a lesser story than Shadowbringers or Endwalker. Encounter design (as of writing in patch 7.0) is excellent, with both extreme trials being a ton of fun and novel in their own regards. Dungeon structure is dramatically improved upon previous expansions, with almost certainly the best leveling dungeons so far. The first graphics update is spectacular and most of the music is to the caliber a fan of FFXIV will expect. Pictomancer is a blast to play and a real contender for the most fun job Square has ever made, and Viper is fast and flashy if perhaps lacking a bit in unique identity. Several jobs are at a bit of a low point (Black Mage, Summoner, Monk, Dragoon, and to varying degrees all of the tanks, healers, and physical ranged DPS), but there's enough variety in combat roles at this point that most people will find at least a handful of jobs that they resonate with, even if they might not be their old favorites.Most of the negative reviews are going to focus in on the character writing or voice direction of new character Wuk Lamat, but I never found myself disliking her to any meaningful degree. Certainly there are moments in the story where she comes off as naive or excessively tolerant, but in a game full of grandiose, melodramatic characters, I don't feel as though an excessively optimistic protagonist is too far out of place. Given the option to do post-Endwalker and Dawntrail over, I think Square would have elected to introduce her and the continent of Tural earlier, to present exposition that unfortunately has to be in the early levels of Dawntrail proper. As it stands, it does feel as though parts of the level 90-93 story drag on a bit, but once the full narrative gets moving it's largely enjoyable with only a few missed notes.If Dawntrail can keep up the gameplay improvements that it's introduced so far, and if the content roadmap that Square has previously shown can be kept to, then I think there will be a strong argument for it being the XIV expansion, even if the main narrative never hits the emotional highs that we've come to expect of the game. Even if not, FFXIV is still an excellent game, but some of the cracks in the formula are starting to show after a decade of iteration. Hopefully Square takes all the negative feedback into consideration and knocks it out of the park in 8.0. Until then, most will likely enjoy their time in Dawntrail, even if they may be bored for a few hours during its narrative.",1720731951,1,0,positive

O que pra mim fez total sentido. Eu li todo Endwalker e o final foi muito algo de final de uma saga, e essa DLC entra pra ser um início de uma nova saga, que sempre vai começar por baixo vibe mais descontraída e tal, é tipo SUPER normal acontecer isso. É só ver UCM, Star Wars, Senhor dos Anéis, Harry Potter ou qualquer obra contando uma saga ou jornada de personagens.  Eu até entendo o povo não gostar da Wuk Lamat como personagem, afinal gostos e gostos, eu amei ela. Maaaas falaram que é um erro ou ruim ela ser uma co protagonista ai eu acho forçar demais. A história o tempo inteiro mostra que o Warrior of Light é uma espécie de tutor/segurança dela e que se o nosso personagem quisesse não teria competição. Nosso personagem que já é alguém muito respeitado e forte é colocado como um veterano e auxiliar de alguém inexperiente na história. Isso pra mim é sensacional. Ver o crescimento da personagem da Wuk Lamat por toda a história é incrível.

76561198043799272,108379,1,english,"[WARNING: Spoiler Heavy Review]To put things simply I believe a critical review of this expac's story is a necessary consequence of how impactful this game has been on its player base. The last two expacs have been touted as possibly the best FF stories of all time, and its cemented a special place in many hearts because of that. Ishikawa managed to write two empathetic stories back to back that resonated deeply during times of crisis.Hence we all return for Dawntrail, knowing full well the stakes are unlikely to be as high, but actually I believe there was potential for that height to be reached again. WIth Shadowbringers we had a bizarre adventure in an upside-down world that made us question our perspective on righteousness while simultaneously tackling themes of grief and loss. Endwalker gave us an existential climax taking us beyond creation and purpose itself.Dawntrail on its surface could be a tight-knit found family story about coming to terms with your own birth, your place in the world, and learning to co-exist with others. A story about life's whole journey including its untimely ends. Maybe even references to Day of the Dead in this heavily Latin American-inspired journey through some of the coolest and prettiest zones the game has seen. The broad strokes of this expac could be just as powerful as the last two, but with Ishikawa stepping down as the writer and taking a managerial role, I feel the execution was lacking.What we got instead was simply told through the lens of a shounen side-arc. The emotions and villain writing took too much a back-seat to intense amounts of talk-no-jutsu. Wuk Lamat was actually a character I enjoyed, actually the entire dawntrail cast is arguably the most likeable in all the expacs, but there is too much time spent on mundane parts of the game to flesh them out. The writer of pandaemonium wrote this MSQ and I feel it shows. The villain motives could only be described as cartoonishly sociopathic, and we never really got to fully explore their cryptic backstories before just killing them. Much like the Zero arc before it, it feels like FFXIV is employing an almost gacha-game like tactic of attaching us at the hip to one character at a time, and shoving that character in our face and hoping we all come out adoring them.That said if you're here to play the game, this is the most fun the content has ever been, and the prettiest the game has ever looked. I'm leaving this review here because I hope the team takes all the negative feedback to heart on a story that I think its important to so many people to not disrespect its legacy. I'm optimistic about what it could've been, but thats just it. It didn't live up to its potential. Here's hoping the patch msq retro-actively explores what the main msq did not.",1720727571,17,3,positive
76561198345306588,227020,771,english,"Pros:-Better encounter design, expert dungeons/rou will no longer make me fall asleep like it did in EW.-Pictomancer & Viper are genuinely well done additions to the DPS roster, both are really fun to play. -All of the DT zones are beautiful in their own right with good OST.

The music, as well, is some of my favorite in the game. Honestly I cannot say that any other expansion's base (x.0) soundtrack is as good as Dawntrail's, in my personal opinion. The locations, too, are breathtaking and incredibly fun to explore, ESPECIALLY the two cities.

Well, it's taken me several days now to decide if I want to press that thumb up or down. I really wish there was a way to leave a more specific score and not just GOOD/BAD but I guess that's what these comments are for. Dawntrail had a lot of good points. Nothing overly spectacular but there's a lot in it that I quite liked. Pictomancer was super fun, I liked the music and I liked the environments a lot. The dungeons and trials were really nice as well. Not to mention that we got the engine upgrade, suddenly it's a much more modern looking game and I'm all for it. I really quite liked the end part BUT here comes the tangent to my dislikes:Dawntrail also had a few but much larger annoyances. While I did like the end part, that's like, 80% into the expansion. It's late, and it's short and it's not all that well executed. I'm fine with the main story putting me on the sideline and I can see how a lot of people dislike Wuk Lamat in part because of it. I personally didn't mind Wuk Lamat as a character... BUT, lugging her around come to feel like having a Disney princess following you around. She really does have a severe case of Talk No Jutsu and it makes any sort of character development feel super anticlimactic. It doesn't sound so bad but it's executed so poorly that it becomes sorta abrasive. Once it happens a few times you start dreading each time she's on screen. It's like ""Oh no, what important moment will she ruin this time...!?"". I understand that things are supposed to have a different focus this time around and I appreciate the challenge the writers have in establishing a new foundation, but this just feels, unfocused and poorly executed to me. The scions also unfortunately got sidelined and had very few memorable moments, except Graha trying very hard at the very end the glorious bastard. But it was also on brand with the rest of DT, short and too sudden to feel impactful. DT was the very essence of a 5-6/10 experience for me. It's not bad, it does a lot of things well, but it does an equal amount poorly. In the end I did still like the good things it gave us, and because it's already sitting on a rather low score, I think a thumb up here and a long as heck review would have to be the best answer.

He'd still have to contend with the freaking warrior of light, Doman Shinobi, Werlyt, THE FREAKING G WARRIOR, New Bozja, The grand company of Eorzea, The Ishgardian knights, All of Dravania, Vytra and his country, Garlea, The Limsan Navy and more besides.

Fates are great new jobs are great and the graphics overhaul is great.ofc im not denying theres nothing wrong with this expansion. i dont like some of the new VAs and i think the new zones are pretty bland. but its really not bad. Storblood has a weak MSQ but it has the best content IN THE WHOLE ASS GAME it was peak and it always will be so just cuz some MSQ is bad dosent mean the expansion cant be good.Ignore the dumbass MSQ andies and take advice from a actuall player who has invested time.

76561198054779268,243643,2774,english,"Loved this expansion! The music is phenomenal, the characters are fun and expressive, and the story was amazing! People are trying so hard to compare this expansions story with that of ShB/EW and thinking that's a fair comparison buts its not. Its a brand new tale that's laying out the ground work for a whole new story. ShB/EW was amazing, nobody is going to argue against that, but ShB/EW were only as good as they were because of the ground work laid out for them from ARR through StB, they were the END of a 10 year long story. And this is what DT is doing, its introducing us to a whole new story that's only just begun and they did an amazing job doing so. So if you think that maybe you shouldn't pick this up because the story is ""bad"". Well it isn't, Its good, like really good. its a narrative that's not trying to top what came before it but instead build itself a whole new adventure and I am excited to see what SE has in store for us!

The music is awesome, the dungeons and trials were and still are fun to play. The zones are gorgeous and the graphics update had me taking screenshots everywhere. The story of course started slow at the beginning but in my opinion it's as slow as all the other expansions at the beginning, so it didn't bother me too much, as I was excited to learn about the new characters. I think the first half, while slow, was necessary to develop the new characters and their motivations. It really ramps up in the second half and it has some of my favorite zones and music. Overall, I thought the story was solid, had strong themes at the end, and makes me excited of what's to come.As a warning though, if you're A) a huge fan of being the main character and doing all the cool stuff yourself, or B) you really don't like Wuk Lamat, your enjoyment of this expansion pack will vary, as it places a huge emphasis on Wuk Lamat and the Warrior of Light takes a backseat as a result. I also highly suggest playing with anything other than English voice-acting as I made the mistake of doing so because I'm used to the other VAs from prior expansions. No shade to Wuk's VA but the consistent flat delivery with the accent made it hard to like the character at first.Overall, positive experience, would recommend just on the basis of dungeon/trial content alone! Maybe post-DT will give me the corny beach/vacation fan service MSQ I'm hoping for. :P",1720663711,0,0,positive

This review may change based on the post game patches.

Some people that is gonna bother others like myself thought it was ok story is maybe 8/10. Some plot holes witch I'm sure they will touch on ( I hope) bug me. Now for the dungeons an trials. Some best we have had in years mechanicaly challenging an not mind numbing boring. If I had to rade them it be 9/10.All an all this expansion so far is 9/10 for me as the gameplay is gonna be what keeps you playing. Side note if you played FF9 this expansion is gonna be lil love letter in spots. So that made it a 9/10 instead of a 8/10 for me.,1720660414,0,0,positive
76561198120580053,0,0,english,"I enjoyed the story, quality of life improvements, graphic improvements, dungeons, trials, etc. Honestly this is probably the most fun I've had mechanically in a x.0 expansion release. Pictomancer and Viper are super fun jobs. Idk if anything is going to top the story of EW for me for a while just because it was the conclusion to a 10 year story, however I had a lot of fun with Dawntrail's story as well. I liked exploring new cultures and reflecting on themes from FF9. I also loved the FF9 references. It makes me excited to see where this story will go because 7.0 is very much the beginning of a story.If you don't like Wuk Lamat as a character or expect 7.0 to top the story of 6.0 you'll probably be disappointed. With all the Scions having finished their character arcs, I have a feeling XIV wants a new cast to focus on and I think that change will rub some the wrong way. However, again, I do think this is the most fun I've had in an expansion launch when it comes to the dungeon and trials. It's nice seeing more unique and engaging mechanics.",1720659397,3,0,positive
76561198356583841,0,0,english,"The newest addition to the best game of all time lags in some respects, but succeeds in many others. Normally FFXIV's storytelling is the star, and certainly no one expected it to meet or surpass the standard set by Endwalker, but in this expansion the story is burdened by things that 'need to' happen instead of following the natural curiosity and inclinations of the player.New areas and environmental design: 10/10, the glowy forest is absolutely peak.Battle content: 10/10, refreshingly challenging while also maintaining the ethos that players should be able to learn the fights as they play them for normal content.New classes: 10/10, Viper is smooth as silk and an absolute joy to play. I haven't touched picto yet but the aesthetic is immaculate.New skills: 10/10, Sage's AOE dot and Dancer's new finishers just *feel* good. 'Revisit' on botanist and miner is the biggest jolt of dopamine I've felt in a long time.Glam: 9/10, too much of a focus on futuristic and weirdly kinky shit for my taste, but the Dancer artifact gear alone is worth the 40$ I paid for this expansion. The two dye channels are game-changing and I have already squandered millions of gil on it. Peak content. Graphics: 10/10, The character and environment redesign is profoundly respectful of the spirit and 'look' of the old game while advancing the quality by leaps and bounds. I have taken literally hundreds of gposes in the last two weeks simply because I can't help it- the lighting, the colors, the plants, and my own WoL are an immaculate visual treat.Music: 9/10, Soken is a master at work. He took some big risks here, but the Shaaloani daytime theme and the trial boss fight music are all-time bangers. 'Smile' suffered severely from strained and uncomfortable vocals.Voice Acting: 8/10, I loved Galool Ja Ja's voice actors in particular. I would personally throw myself into the flames for the cowboy catboys in Shaaloani. Wuk Lamat's VA doesn't deserve the level of hate she's gotten, especially considering that this is (one of?) her first major roles, but no one is gonna defend that 'spheeeeeene listen to me' line. Honestly I think we might have to blame poor directing on that one.Mounts and Minions: 10/10, capybara and a very cute cat. No notes.MSQ: 6.5/10, and it hurts to say that. I really, really, really wanted to like it, but I never really felt 'involved' in the story- more like a witness. I'm a person who enjoys visiting new places and learning about the cultures, but after 20 or so hours of worldbuilding I started to get tired. I enjoyed the second half a lot more than the first. By the end of the story I had cried a few times. Despite how slow it felt at times the final area threw a grief-shaped brick at my head and left me sobbing. Even though the first half was slow, I really appreciated how the writers took respectful inspiration from real-world cultures and proactively demonstrated cultural appreciation over appropriation. Personally I think you could cut the entire Moblin arc out of the story without losing anything at all. I've spent... a few hours in this game. A paltry percentage of that was spent in MSQ. The content that matters- the content that will last me for the next two years- that's the content that's absolutely jaw-shatteringly stunning and well-executed.If a slow, world-buildy MSQ is the price we pay to set up the next big story CBU3 wants to tell, then I'm all ears.",1720658607,1,0,positive

76561197995190535,0,0,english,"Best dungeons in the game yet, and more challenging than usual. Great tunes, great areas and setting. The story works. It's not as good as the last two xpacs, but the comparison feels unfair as that part of the story had a foundation built up over years. I can level some criticism at it. The first half of the story is a laid back adventure, almost in the style of a classical folk tale, spanning interesting locales, themes, and paying homage to cool things. It works well enough. It's low stakes and pretty comfy. My main bone to pick with it if i had to choose one, is that the direction of it is a little crude in places, and some cutscenes can end up feeling a little stunted. There is still plenty of awesome. Newly introduced characters have functioning arcs for the most part, though the motivation for some feels underdeveloped, and some characters feel a little one-dimensional at times. (e.g. while Wuk Lamat has a decent self-actualization kind of arc, she's too much of a goody two shoes and could've used a darker side imo, perhaps something she could've struggled with, rather than being the TOGETHER WE CAN mascot she often is)The second half of the story ups the stakes, the scope, and the drama. It works well enough, and the focus shifts away from character arcs to subtext and commentary, which is not uncommon with Final Fantasy storytelling in general. There is room to think and ponder if you're into that, and i was. Once again the story suffers a little from under-developed motivations that make the antagonist side of things feel stupider than it had to be, though the writing is competent enough to cover for that effectively by the end. The writers are obviously aware of the gaps, and did enough to fill them in with a little suspension of disbelief, though there was room for more. By the end, even if it doesn't hit as hard as Endwalker did, it still successfully tugs at heartstrings and pushes the feels button in several places.As to the main character's role in the story, it's the passenger seat. Thinking back on it now, i sort of feel like it would have been better if they'd taken either a more passive role, or a more front-and-center one, but as it is it's sort of awkwardly in the middle. It's a Wuk Lamat & Friends story, but you still do the heavy lifting by necessity. That said, nothing here is bad or offputting in any way.On the whole, it's been a good expansion for me and i'm happy to see where they take it from here, with a little more to build on. The 'content' is as good as it's ever been if not better. The fights are great, the mounts are cool, the monsters, areas and gear are awesome. The graphical update is a really nice and welcome addition. The characters are cool and memorable, and whatever failings the story has i am counting as growing pains in the transition from the old towards the new.tl;dr is good, don't worry about itP.S. It's REALLY cool to see elements of meso-american cultures, and how neatly they're integrated into the gameworld. It feels almost educational at times, and there is a lot of detail, respect and passion here. There is also Texas.",1720651473,2,0,positive
76561198138711617,383387,40,english,"(Spoiler Free)In my opinion as a 11 year FFXIV veteran; this expansion is what I expected and the community is reacting all the same as the other content released in the past Stormblood and the 2.X patch series [mixed]. At the time we could not see the direction the game could take or how the story was unfolding and I will say with all SE has built on in FFXIV I am more excited now than I was years ago with an expansion like this. Only because I have seen what they can do with laying down a good foundation and taking the time to build. This is not an end to an 9 Year story or like how stormblood into shadowbringers story of saving our friends. This is what it is a new start to a new world we will get to adventure. The MSQ is a sole expansion story that will bring good questions and answers, which kept me engaged through the story. Keeping in mind that knowing the smallest of background details and lore drops are big hints to what is to come for FFXIV. There was a few times that the MSQ dropped a lull of a quest and breaks did occur during the over-arching story. This breaking of the pace, before ramping it up again, was jarring. I did enjoy Wuk Lamat as her character engagement is on par from Lyse and Hyen. Her personality and direction does show the growth, unlike Lyse. Who, by the time we entered the Stormblood MSQ; only had to answer the question of ""how will she lead a revolution?"" Lyse already had growth part of the 3.x patches and her growth into a revolutionary leader was set to be the sole character story focus of stomblood. Where as Wuk Lamat does not have that growth prior as she is a new character and as her story unfolds the growth is set up as intended. The MSQ does a good job balancing the focus on the major Tulliolal cast making it truly an adventure you are on. Rather than the Scions and their world saving endeavors. I did feel enjoyment for the MSQ and cannot wait to see what comes next in the 7.x story patches. There are subtle and unsubtle hints of world progression that I know Square Enix and CBU 3 will build off of in the future.I have friends who i recommend waiting until about the 7.3 patch to return as that usually is the completion of the 7.0+X story excluding Endwalker. As they need more than just the base expansion story when returning. They love raid content but also like the story but need more. knowing them i recommend waiting until the 7.3 patch. Which should add two 8 man raid series, two 24 man raids, after MSQ story, Potential added Trial raid series (unless they pull an endwalker), a Explorer zone ( Bozja and Eureka like content), and Galaxy exploration. which all is what i know they would be happy to pay for a subscription for.Lastly to everyone complaining about Wuk Lamat, If you are reading this and have joined post Stormblood During Shadowbringers let me say this. None of us at the time of the 2.x Patches knew how big Haurchefant could be played in the havensward expansion.  The community thought Hyen would play a bigger role in the Stormblood Expansion but he saw very little time. If there is a character you do or don't enjoy. Just know you have no idea how square will utilize them in the future. It could be a lot or very little. Just go with the flow.She is your ""Pray Return TO THE WAKING SANDS MOMENT."" It happens in MMO's and CBU3 has earned my trust that it didnt bother me as to me it was expected..and please no more boats. She isn't woke or even is part of an agenda, it's a NPC who leads you through her story. You are just along for the ride; like Hydalen did with us for 10 Years, even Zero afterward. The world is building and SE is just creating characters to deliver us to the story. Don't read in to it too much because none of the other countries VA's are trans, they used her as she applied and did the best for the character they wrote.",1720649007,16,1,positive
76561199536151035,52954,1178,english,"SPOILER WARNING:Yall the story is still great just not as great as it used to be. Which makes sense we saved the world twice in a row and i would be annoyed if we did so a third time in a row. Dawntrail's story still does plenty of things great but you all refuse to acknowledge so. The worldbuilding of Tural is incredible I feel like it goes very well in depth into each tribe's cultures and their significance to the overall lore of tural especially if you do the side quests. Also sure you may be mad you interact with Wuk too much but what were you expecting going into this expansion? I feel like it was clear that this would be very focused around Wuk. And even if you still don't like how much you interact with Wuk i feel like 50% of the time you do interact with her it usually shifts the focus from her to someone or something else real quick. And if you still don't like that then the second half of the msq is way better and I do not know what to tell you.Anyways moving on from story stuff the new bosses in dungeons and trials and whatever are way better and feel a lot more unique(I still wish dungeons weren't hallways though but I understand why they are still that way)As a mount collector I love the new mount designs. The graphics update is also incredible. When it was first announced I was worried about my fps dropping but when I got in my fps has not dropped whatsoever. I feel overall that dawntrail is a great expansion and yall just need to lower your standards a little for the story. Give CBU3 about 1 or 2 more expansions to do a bit more story buildup and then we will get something as great as shadowbringers and endwalker. 9/10 expansion(will probably change review over time as more content gets released for dawntrail)First edit and it hasn't even been 10 minutes: i just feel like saying I like bakool ja ja's character development although it isn't all too detailed.

Wuk Lamat's real father(honestly the best elector and I won't even explain why) Otis(honestly it was quite sad seeing him die and it was nice to see that there was actually someone caring for Bakool Ja) Cahciua( I was not expecting Erenville's mother to be this enthusiastic considering erenville is very calm and collected. honestly it was a nice surprise also i love the nicknames she gives erenville) Mablu(Although not important she is very relatable with the ""i wanna go down this career path but i don't know if (insert literally anyone here) would approve"")(also btw the way the moblins speak are funny :P)",1720648164,0,0,positive

However, what's released on launch has been excellent dungeons, trials, and additions to the combat.

76561198061664455,0,0,english,"This expansion is easily recommendable. Specifically for the non-story related content. The battle content itself is the best they've ever created. The music, the aesthetic, the visual designs, the graphical and system improvements, it's all been spectacular. I'm really looking forward to what's to come. With that being said, It is clear to me that the developers listen to their player base which is why I wish to provide some critical feedback.[h1] Main Story Questing  [/h1]I play this game for the battle content, the economic element with crafters & gatherers and of course most important of all, looking good while doing it. I've never been interested in the main story of this game and will not be making comment on the plot. To me the MSQ is an obstacle which must be overcome in order to access the real content of the game. The actual tasks that are required of you during the questing of the MSQ are outdated and need significant improvement. I do not understand why there are still unskippable cutscenes in a modern release. I do not want to click on 8 different pillars in Tuliyollal one at a time. I do not want to search for a random npc deliberately hidden from line of sight in a large area. Aether current locations often trick the player with elevation requiring rerouting with mobs placed within aggro range. Flying should be granted for the zone at the same point in which you gain the MSQ aether current. The trailing quests are back and although they are improved are still a time sink. The instanced content was disappointing to me. I was optimistic that after the instance within the quest ""The Game Is Afoot"" (patch 6.55) that this would be a baseline for innovation within this aspect of the game but the player in Dawntrail still never has any agency. It's immersion breaking when a boss sits on 0.1% HP obviously invulnerable because we must wait on a line of dialogue. It's disheartening to me to go into these knowing that my input ultimately doesn't matter. These instances are completely scripted. I will likely be completely healthy for the entire fight only to be one shot because the script demands it.All my issues with the main quest can all be summarised by saying that the questing is not interesting.  It's tedious and frustrating. It's not challenging or engaging, and it blatantly disregards the players' time.[h1] Job Design and Systems [/h1]While the action change setting is a welcome addition, I thought that we would be able to condense combo'd abilities into a single button similar to when you control alternative characters in story content. I don't believe that there would be a meaningful loss in skill expression if ninja's 1->2 AOE combo was given the option of being a singular morphing button. I highlighted AOE combos because they can often be irrelevant depending on the content that you're doing while still taking up space on your hotbar. The system is also inconsistent. If we take ninja again for example. Bushin can be both combo and separate from Phanom Kamaitachi but Ten Chi Jin can not be separated from Tenri Jindo. Both options should be available for both pairings.I wouldn't be opposed to being able to combo single target rotations on jobs that made sense for it. Ninja's and Warrior's 1->2->[3/4] or reaper's 1->2->3. This option obviously shouldn't be an option for jobs (among others) such as Dragoon and Monk.[h3]Gunbreaker[/h3]Happy to hear that Trajectory will be getting an enmity effect in 7.01. In general I'm really happy with the changes to this job. The Lion Heart combo shouldn't interrupt your gnashing fang but I believe this was acknowledged as a bug. I'm content with Fated Brand's addition but it is personally an awkward button to press in AOE with my specific hotbar layout. I don't believe its addition was meaningful or a net gain. An option to Link Fated Circle with Fated Brand would have been nice here.[h3]Sage[/h3]Sage lost some of its gracefulness within dungeons. In Endwalker when running alongside trash you would apply your dot because it's instant cast and then AOE once the pack is stationary. Now with the addition of Eukrasian Dykraisa which overwrites Eukrasian Dosis III the more potent dot, there is an over reliance on Toxikon II to maintain mobility and optimal DPS (a resource which situationally may not be available). A simple remedy to this would be that Eukrasian Dykraisa should not be able to affect targets effected by Eukrasian Dosis III. This way you can single target dot while moving and also AOE dot the grouped mobs without concern of overwriting a freshly applied dot . This method would still avoid the single target double dot oversight from the media tour.[h3]Monk[/h3]I want to acknowledge first that I understand that this job is bugged and that several components are not functioning as intended. From my perspective clear issues like this are distractions as eventually they will be rectified as stated by Naoki Yoshida.Monk was my main job in Endwalker. Upon looking at the changes presented at the media tour it was clear to me that the developers actually understood the issues pertaining to the job. Brotherhood allowing you to over cap your chakra during burst is an elegant way to prevent clipping with monk's fast skill speed. Inspirited Meditation is another great addition. I also believe that the sticker system is effectively the same system to the Endwalker dots and buffs system but presented in a much clearer and intuitive way. Additionally I won't be mourning the loss of optimal drift. The problem that I have with Monk is that the sticker system as a resource is [b][i]functionally irrelevant[/i][/b] when the next correct GCD is always highlighted for you. The development team has stated that ""it was our aim to preserve monk’s playstyle from the Patch 6.x series"". My experience with monk's playstyle in Endwalker was that you had to manage a status effect with each form. Opo-opo, raptor and coeurl form. Every 1.93 seconds you had to make a decision on an enhancement or a spender. That's what Monk's identity was to me. That's why I liked it. That is its essence. It is why it was considered to be so difficult. With the highlighting system that's all gone. What is the point of a form system if there's no choice to be made within the forms? Why engineer a GCD ratio when that ratio is irrelevant? With Monk's current state I can disable the Beast Chakra Gauge from my HUD layout and play the job exactly the same. The HUD serves no critical purpose. This is a design failure. The job's fundamentals no longer synergise with each other. If they truly wish to retain 6.x Monk I firmly believe that Monk's forms [b][i]must[/i][/b] highlight all available GCDs, not just the correct one. The job doesn't function without it. A closing thought on difficulty; I believe that easy jobs have a place within the game. I personally enjoy dancer, an ""easy"" job. Ultimately I'll accept the direction the developers wish to go but Endwalker added Reaper a pretty streamlined job and Dawntrail added Viper which arguably plays itself with the same action highlighting.  There is room in the game for one or two difficult jobs that offer skill expression purely from the perspective that they are fulfilling to play. It is okay for there to be difficult jobs (not necessarily Monk) that offer a more fulfilling experience through mastery which may not be appealing to your average player. I hope that this trend of simplification of jobs will be balanced when needed with a concentrated dose of complexity. We will see, in time.",1720546897,4,0,positive

Erst als ich selber durch den Dschungel von [Gebietname hier] und durch die hüglige Umgebung von [Gebietname hier] gewandelt bin, verstand ich, was das Grafik Update bewirkt hat. Die Zonen fühlen sich nun nicht mehr so leer an. Hauptsächlich weil man von einem Rand nicht mehr der zweite Rand sieht. Zwischendrin sind überall Hügel, Höhlen, Gebüsch und Gebäude. Und wenn es doch einmal an etwas Mangelt, dann gibt es einfach Nebel, der die Weitsicht nimmt und so die mangelnde Grösse kaschiert. Das Erkunden hat mir das erste Mal seit langer Zeit wirklich Spass gemacht, da ich das Gefühlt hatte überall etwas neues entdecken zu können. Zugegeben bei den späteren Gebieten wurde etwas mit den Sehenswürdigkeiten gespart, dafür sind sie amtosphärisch fantastisch!Nun die Story. Ich habe viele Leute gesehen, welche die Story nicht abgeholt hat. Für mich persönlich hat sie aber genau den Nagel getroffen, welcher ich so gerne in diesem Spiel sehe. Sei es die [spoiler] Besuche bei den Verschiedenen Stämme in der Azim Steppe [/spoiler] oder auch [spoiler] das Einsammeln der Verschiedenen Artefakte in Il Mheg [/spoiler]. Ich liebe es, wenn wir als Gruppe von einem Stamm oder Volk zum nächsten pilgern können und so über die verschiedenen Kulturen etwas lernen. Die erste Hälfte von Dawntrail ist halt genau das und nicht viel mehr, was für manch einer wohl abschrecken kann. Mich aber hat es vollkommen abgeholt. Und auch die zweite Hälfte hat durch die Einblicke in ein gänzlich anderes Volk, mit einer völlig anderen Lebensweise wirklich interessante Denkanstösse geliefert. [spoiler] <3 Sphene [/spoiler] Einzig das ach so böse Pacing ist hier und da etwas länger gezogen, als es das vielleicht hätte sein müssen. Ich spreche dabei hauptsächlich über den Anfang des zweiten Teils der Erweiterung und teilweise gegen Ende. Aber am Ende finde ich es weitaus gelungener als noch im Endwalker. Meiner Meinung nach gibt es sehr viel wenige ""Filler Quests"" welche nur da sind, um die Story zu strecken. Aber ich denke, da hat jeder eine andere Ansicht.Fazit: Grafikupdate ist überraschend gut gelungen.

76561198127073765,0,0,english,"[b]I'll spell it out for ya:[/b]Dawntrail isn't a groundbreaking expansion, it's more of the same. The way the story is told and how you progress through the story quests is what it has always been: a circular loop of talking to NPC, doing a boring task, and then talking to another NPC. Does it objectively do that loop better compared to other expansions? No. Does it objectively do that loop worse compared to other expansions? No.Don't let anyone fool you into thinking this expansion specifically has a pacing issue. Literally every expansion has slogs of boring unfun setup quests in the format of mundane chores we call """"""gameplay"""""" and this one is no different.[b]So what about the story? Is that any good? [/b]For the most part, yea. While the beginning (roughly up to level ~94) is painfully slow and is reminiscent of the most boring parts of Stormblood, the latter half is a significantly better and will actually make you lean forward to pay attention. [b]So what about these controversies I hear about all the time? [/b]The only legitimate complaint I can see people have is with the character Wuk Lamat. The problem people have is that she is the protagonist of this expansion instead of your own character, which is true. What irks most I feel in terms of character growth is that her story is a retread of Lyse from Stormblood for the first half. The whole moral story of ""I should get to know my people better to be a good ruler"" has been done to death and doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's actually insulting to the player's own intelligence that teaching basic moral lessons to Wuk that a 9 year old can understand is the main driving plot up to level 94. I feel that the players that hated her basically tuned out after two quests and just cutscene skipped everything, even though her character does become bearable after the halfway point of this expansion. There is no other notable controversy besides Wuk Lamat and even calling that a controversy is a mile-long stretch. Don't let outrage culture and fabricated controversies control your life. This is a video game, rofl.[b]What about the actual content: skills, bosses, etc?[/b]Everything is most of the same EXCEPT for bosses. The dungeon and trial bosses I encountered during the main story were more difficult and engaging than any other expansion and it's an amazing change. We're at a point where if you're mindlessly just staring at the floor for circles to dodge, you can, and will get punished for that.

People complaining about the story are either impatient or lack any sort of media literacy.The first half of the story is an enjoyable, lower stakes romp through the nation of Tural with your new best bud shonen protag Wuk Lamat.

In the first half of the DLC rather than being the plucky young hero, you're THE Grizzled Veteran Adventurer. And I think that's a really interesting take for the WoL after the events of Endwalker.The second half, without getting into spoiler territory, surpasses Endwalker in my eyes. The areas, stories, music, duties, literally everything that happens was a delight. Not to mention the far more emotional beats that start appearing near the end of the expansion. Also, the last boss is the best trial in the whole game. With the best theme in the whole game.

76561199437912761,0,0,english,"Took my time with the MSQ (taking around 60 hours) and didn’t regret it at all. 1.Wuk Lamat’s character progression is similar to Alphinaud’s but in a much shorter and faster time. If you rush through the MSQ, especially during the first half of the story, it’s easy to think that Wuk Lamat, as a FFXIV character, is insufferable and shallow. But it’s when you take your time with her and understand her perspective that you might gain a sense of witnessing a part of a character’s coming-to story. You aren’t the main character in this expansion but a witness to a character’s journey to finding their identity and as a result becoming someone great. 2.(SOME SPOILERS)The second half of the MSQ involving Solution Nine and Alexandria was something I didn’t expect. They told us that this expansion was sort of a “summer vacation” and I already had my suspicion that it might contain more than what they said, but it surprised me. Krile and Erenville’s side story was great and my favourite part of the MSQ. The reveal of Solution Nine and Queen Sphene’s intention reminded me of Shadowbringer’s MSQ and Emet-Selch’s perspective in that MSQ. Queen Sphene is another character that was conflicted but ultimately chose a path that she can’t go back from. In my opinion her decision wasn’t wrong but it was one that went against what we chose. A character that we understand but have different priorities, similar to Emet-Selch. This “different priority” is what makes a character compelling and why Emet-Selch is so beloved by the community.  Queen Sphene didn’t reach that level but nonetheless she was a great character that I understood and resonated with.FINAL THOUGHTS The whole second half of the MSQ was what made me appreciate the expansion. The MSQ went from a relaxing story that involved a character’s coming-to story to one that involved the tragic end of a character's journey. It was because I chose to take my time with this story that made me understand and appreciate it. I don't think that this is the best MSQ of FFXIV. Shadowbringers and Endwalker are two JRPG stories that I hold special, but this MSQ isn’t a boring one if you appreciate the same things I do. ",1720508126,1,0,positive

76561198041302581,0,0,english,"It's honestly baffling to me how much hate this expansion's story has been getting online.You're not the main character of this expansion. But realistically, you haven't been the narrative focus of *any* of the expansions. The story has always primarily emphasized the decisions and emotional development of characters other than yourself.The player character taking a position as a mentor along someone else's journey was both very refreshing and very fitting given their strength and wealth of experience. Here you *can't* do everything yourself as the great and mighty hero, because you're not here to squash a problem, you're here to help someone else grow and learn. And then when there's a real threat that needs to be confronted, you *do* step up to the plate.Personally I found the narrative main character to be endearing, and her growth over the course of the story was wonderful. Exploring this new continent and learning about the various peoples that inhabit it was also a treat. There was a rough spot or two, but the story is nowhere even close to the dumpster fire that some of these reviews would have you believe. Easily in my top 3 expansions.Also, her voicework was pretty good overall. It's clear she can convey emotion, shout, etc., so for the handful of scuffed lines that people obsess over I can only reasonably conclude that the direction given to the actress was lacking (VAs don't get to see the scene and are reliant on what direction they're given to guess at how to read the line. If the director is hasty or omits critical details, you get line reads that don't fit). This has been a problem with their handling of english VA before. (For a funny one see Alphinaud diving into water, but there are other examples as well when you look for lines that just don't quite fit the scene)The battle content has also been phenomenal. There's been a clear step-up in the difficulty of normal mode content across the board, with dungeons especially being notably more engaging. Some dungeon fights even have mechanics that previously would have only been in more difficult content (like raids). Not every boss is a hit, but the fights have pretty consistently been at a higher level than they were in past expansions. You can really tell that the encounter design team was allowed to go a little wild here.It feels like dungeons are now being properly used as a place to train players on how to do raid mechanics, and while the normal mode trials aren't that much more difficult than they were in the 6.x patch content, they still feel much more ""raid-like"" in a way that's hard to describe.

This includes everything from wearing swimsuits, to clearing your first Ultimate fight, to TENDO SETSUGEKKA, and everything in between.And yet, criticizing it by itself just doesn't feel right to me.

Look up a plot summary if you please.Dawntrail is the ""vacation"" expansion where people say you're the Kakashi or something. I don't care about that.

They will be remembered so long as the idea of their grave exists.[*][spoiler]Sadly, the Mamool Ja are culturally fascist (before you visited them). It's pretty sad because they've lost a conflict and hate where they live. They tell you they want to murder everyone in Tural for their transgressions, but really, they just want to grow things other than bananas and see the sun.

It cannot and will not be as good and exciting as Shadowbringers or Endwalker were, purely because those two expansions were the climax of a 10 year old story in the making. It took time to get there, and it needed everything that happened before it to make any sense and be that good. This is especially true if you consider how many people who praised Shadowbringers actually went BACK and rewatched/replayed through ARR and forth just to piece things together. The build up was necessary and it made everything feel much more heart wrenching.Not saying I expect that it'll need another 10 years in order for this new chapter to get good, but I'm fine with 7.0 being slow and introducing us to new characters and concepts that grealy expand the possibilities of where the story is going.All in all, Dawntrail felt refreshing, it was a nice change of pace and it felt like what I expected it to feel: a vacation. Loved the OST, loved the beautiful and colorful new areas and the ""cultures"" introduced. It's very fun and I had a great time playing through the story!",1720480984,2,0,positive

While this expac certainly boasts a light-hearted MSQ it doesn't lack in the hard hitting emotional department, either. I didn't expect to get teary-eyed at all while playing through Dawntrail, but some of the deeper moments were wonderful and heart-touching. Though I won't spoil why or how it does dip into some of those darker themes this game is known for as well. The characters were wonderful. Wuk Lamat is adorable. I genuinely don't get the hate, but to each their own. And I really found myself enjoying the more minor characters as well. As far as game play goes, Square Enix really stepped it up. The dungeons are no longer ""fall asleep in your chair"" content. To the point where a few of the last bosses feel much more like trials. All in all, I can understand why the story might not be for everyone and recommend going in with a bit of an open mind for something different from past expacs.",1720480587,2,0,positive

Overall I do recommend it as it's more FFXIV but shaping up to probably be my least favourite expansion.I think everyone was just expecting a fun, simple adventure that basically acts like a holiday for the WoL.Instead we get 3 zones of babysitting an NPC and for what it is worth I don't mind Wuk Lamat and helping her with the competition but it is dull. I was thankfully relieved that seemingly half way through the expansion we get to finally just go off on an adventure by starting off in a wild west themed area and I was finally having fun.Then almost out of nowhere, cyberpunk spacehips and back to babysitting Wuk Lamat as the expansion has one of the worst tonal shifts I've ever seen and you are thrust into a futuristic cyberpunk setting.I just really don't know what they were thinking with this expansion. It's like they had the idea for the Rite of Succession but realised that wasn't enough content for a whole expansion so chucked in this whole cyberpunk malarky. I love futuristic stuff and with Allagan and even Lopporit stuff it didn't feel out of place but here it's so far removed from the tone of the rest of the game that it doesn't even feel like the same game anymore.Maybe this review will change as I carry on with the expansion but so far this is proving very disappointing and not at all what I think anyone was expecting.",1720479429,3,0,positive

I found her annoying, but more than that she is a weak character who replaces the WOL as the main character. Throughout the DLC, we are to believe that simply touring a few locations and speaking with the locals is enough for Wuk Lamat to grow into the leader her people need her to be, but this is never reflected in the writing, it is simply stated through her monologue-ing. We see evil win throughout the game while Wuk Lamat and our companions BEG for everyone to stop like a bullied child on a playground. Are these the same people who faced the end? WTH? The villains are likewise devoid of any real growth with the exception of one that I can think of. Without spoiling anything, I have to express my shock at the end because I think back to some of the big villains of the past and how even at the end we were able to see their humanity and how poignant and beautiful it was to be able to reach into their world and discover their motivations and what drove them to become the monster that we face, but that is not present here in this DLC. Wuk Lamat is basically saying, ""Let's not uncover or address anything lets just say it's ok that there was so much collateral damage at your hands we can still be besties."" This was weak and lazy writing. I was also disappointed with the VA for Erenville's mom. Not that she isn't a good VA only that the voice didn't fit. It had a different energy to it that didn't fit into the FFXIV universe. It was a bad choice. Aside from all of that some very interesting and exciting things did happen and I look forward to future patches and DLC to further explore the universe, as long as Wuk Lamat is not in them. Get rid of this character and replace her with Koana, he was 1000% better.

I'm not going to speculate on how she landed it because we all know how the conspiracy theories towards her involvement go, but regardless she isn't skilled enough to pull off the role and the character suffers. Now with that obvious point out of the way, the actual story is really good. Yes, the first half is a bit of a slog, but if you are invested in the lore of the game then it's quite enjoyable. But yeah, the game could have done a better job in making you invested in the fate of Tural. I assume that feeling of investment is yet to come in the expansion, but they should have done a bit more here at the start. The second half is quite wild, especially if you are a fan of the aforementioned lore of the game and of the franchise as a whole. Point is, don't let the review scores get you down. Too many people had unrealistic expectations considering this is meant to be another soft-reboot of the game.

WHY DOES EVERY ORIENTAL CHARACTER SOUND LIKE YOUR AVERAGE INDIAN IT TECH SUPPORTER?????? i hated it EW and the trend continous.  JP dub is great, it takes some time getting used to it but it is worth.2)First 25-30% of MSQ is like watching the first 12 Episodes of ""Black Clover"".  It is not an enjoyable experience BUT you got to stick it through. If you skip most of Cutscenes dont say ""Wuk lamat bad, MSQ sucks"" DT not recommended.MSQ definately has its moments which make up for the first 20%.3) DT is NOT the worst expansion so far, as it is already better than EW in terms of MSQ, Combat, VA, OST.Dont forget, DT is still in its barebones and has still to recieve Content Updates. My prediction is, that it will be better than Stormblood.Conclusion:Change to JP Dub and skip the first 20% ish of MSQ (when you reach the third zone the story starts to get interesting).I´d give it a 7.5/10.

The graphics update is really nice too, it's refreshing to see some new polish on the graphics I've been looking at for 10 years lol.",1720428220,10,0,positive

76561197984112934,0,0,english,"Okay, as someone who has a heck of a lot of hours in this game (Not that it shows under the expansion (Currently over 11k hours) and has been playing since ARR I'd like to say that I've read all of these thumbs down reviews, and barring the one talking about payment issues (Which is a legit issue at the moment), I'm going to tell you that they're all just whinging for the sake of whinging and none of them should be taken as anything more than angry gamer drivel. That's all it is.Anyone this deep into FFXIV whose opinions are worth their weight will tell you that this is the start of the xpac and to already label it as ""the worst xpac ever"" is flat out ridiculous, attention seeking/rage baiting, and they prolly have little else going on in their lives right now.The story is just fine, typical for msq. if you don't happen to like the way it's written or the fact that this time the story is not centred around the WOL of the big hero, that's not worthy of a legit critique nor it doesn't mean the game is the worst. For crying out loud it's not even finished! It's just the first dang chapter. The complaints around the MSQ are giving off ""I know I'm watching a romance, I paid for romance but it just sucks cause there's no horror/gore!"" vibes. You're not coming to FFXIV to find a Pulitzer prize or Nobel Prize for literature winning novel here (if you are you 100% took a wrong turn somewhere miles back) so those commenting on it as such really need to get off their high horse.All else is similar to any other xpac. The questing system is as it always has been and ever will be. The battle combat is fantastic and fluid. There are wonderful quality of life changes that have been made, class balancing is fine, the new classes are fun and well fleshed out etc. Graphics are better than ever, art style is superb. Music is, as always, godly, voice acting on point etc (And there's just as much as there's always been so complaints around this also don't warrant negative feedback. That's a suggestion to be left to developers.) I've gone on and on about this before in my original review of the game about 5000 hours ago so I will not do it again here.I've come here to simply say this as it seems to be a common issue:Ignore the naysayers. Unless they can actually put aside biases (Which can be and are obviously rooted in... certain issues) and critique the game from a mature and professional standpoint then their ignorant opinions (As that's all they are and not legitimate critiques, doesn't matter if they've penned it in pages of word vomit or a single sentence) aren't worth the few grains of salt the tear stains they have from crying so much leave on their face. They're seeking attention. Don't give it to them.Dawntrail is just fine. It's a whole new experience, a whole new story that has just begun and has a promising future. Enjoy the ride for what it is and if you've liked FFXIV before there's a good chance you'll like it now too.",1720425568,2,0,positive

76561198321081983,0,0,english,"Ff14 Dawntrail review for those who are unsure if they want to play it or not. No spoilers will be said.With the introduction of the graphics changes the game looks and feels a whole lot better. Though queue times at the start of the expansion were bad, it was no where near Endwalker's issues. Some zones even have 6 instances so hunt trains are rejoicing.When it comes to the story of Dawntrail it simply boils down to if you like **Wuk Lamat**.The StoryWuk Lamat is the character you'll be assisting to win the rite of succession so she ascends the throne and rules Tural. Issue is, she's worse in every aspect to the other candidates besides her loving heart- her understanding to other cultures and that she can connect to others easily.  Though, even if I have to admit, her character does improve over the course of the story. Since it's a completely new chapter in our WoL's journey the story takes it's time to cook and gets better as the story progresses. But I don't have the patience for Wuk Lamat, I think her voice actor did a great job but was given an annoying role. She is forced with the WoL and needs babysitting constantly and takes up all your attention. A common joke in the ff14 community is ""Hey lets split up so we can cover more ground. WoL why don't you come with me"" - Wuk Lamat, every fucking zone.Or how everything revolves around speaking to Wuk Lamat and then to Wuk Lamat. And then Wuk Lamat.Though side characters who are introduced will catch your appeal and attention, as endearing or even someone who you love to hate. They all fufill a good position in the story. But Wuk lamat has the most screen time so she either feels repetitive to some, annoying to others (me) or you love her and you're happy she's always there. There are a few decisive fan favourites who are rather controversial, either you love them or you hate them. Which is a good mix so all can enjoy the story in one way or another, at least the characters. Bakool Ja Ja for instance (but I don't recommend searching up his fandom on twitter).You are accompanied by the Twins, Alisae and Alphinaud, Krile and Erenville to Tural along side Wuk Lamat. Krile is another person you learn much about, you learn about her grandfather a scholar from Sharlayan and his connections to the New World and the Golden City. The WoL's vacation doesn't only include participating in Mexican Politics but finding this Golden City as a certain friend at the climax of Endwalker coaxes you to find. Which doesn't disappoint, I assure you.Last bit about the story. If you are a fan of Xenoblade you will love the latter half of the MSQ. Cause Damn, Yoshi P be sniffing the quality shit when it comes to inspiration.__The Gameplay__With the new classes introduced, Viper- The Dual bladed Tweeker and Pictomancer the R34mancer with a horny bonk. The list of Jobs increased from 20 to 22. These additions have been loved by the community as they are both fun and unique classes.Viper is busy job which is easy to learn but is a bit latency dependant as it requires constant double weaving.Pictomancer is a high damage mage, with a very unique rotation that doesn't suffer from lack of mobility.I have played Viper all expansion and got so attached I am now playing it in extremes and savages, Pictomancer has gotten many caster haters to start playing casters.Many classes were reworked but I cannot comment on those since I don't play them.The Dungeons and Trials have been upped in difficulty, every zone has great content- beautiful scenery which was made for the graphics update. The Dungeons are all fun, a surprising addition of difficulty made all the difference. Every boss is surprisingly fun, especially the trials who don't disappoint in extremes. As the game hasn't recieved it's first update yet after the expansion- the raids  have not been added yet. But I can assure you the gameplay is carrying the expansion.Personally I love this expansion, the short comings of the story don't stop me from loving playing ff14. This review was sponsored by Autism.7/10 not as good as the previous 2 expansions when it came to story, but in terms of gameplay it far exceeds them.",1720423201,1,1,positive

It's a fun diversion and palate cleanser after Endwalker, but it is a tonal shift that might not be for everyone. The addition of trusts to the trials as well as those upcoming is promising, and many mechanics have been cleaned up for brevity. The difficulty of mid-tier encounters has been increased considerably, but just enough that it should keep anyone entertained who felt more than confident or a bit bored with later game EW content. The major characters in the expansion are well voiced, especially Wuk Lamat's VA, who does an excellent job making the character's credulousness and kindness believable rather than trite.",1720399148,10,0,positive

Unlike the last two expansions, the story isn't going to throw you for a loop with plot twists or exceptional villains, and the plot twists that are there will likely be spotted well in advance by savvy veterans who've run through the base game and the previous four expansions to this point.If I were to give this overall expansion a number rating, I'd likely put it at an 8 or an 8.5, it's a decent expansion, but if I were to compare it to its predecessors, Dawntrail's story is surpassed by all of its predecessors except for ARR and Stormblood.",1720397195,0,0,positive

76561197999999191,0,0,english,"Having just hit credits I figured I would jot down my thoughts, as the expansion's user review score (which currently sits at 63% of ~2400 reviews) really perplexes me.First and foremost, and this seems to be the reason for a lot of consternation: this is Wuk Lamat's expansion, and you need to accept that or you're going to have a bad time with the expansion. Personally I really Wuk Lamat. She starts off very naive and idealistic, but that is the starting point for her character arc, not the end. If you find yourself getting frustrated with her, have some patience and give her a chance to grow, much like Alphinaud did in Heavensward after being very much hated through ARR.Beyond Wuk, I found the characters to all be delightful. Gulool Ja Ja, Bakool Ja Ja, and Koana were all great and left me wanting to spend more time with them. I do think Krile and Erenville could have had more focus, but I still very much enjoyed what we got from them. Most of the rest of the Scions took a back seat for this expansion, which might be a bummer to some, but honestly they need to. We've had years to get to know Alisaie and Estinien, let them step aside a bit and let new/less developed characters have room to breathe.The music knocks it out of the park, as you would expect. There is one track that sounds like a halfway point between an old disney animated song and gospel music that surprised me, but I didn't hate it.The zones are all interesting and colorful, and most end up being split in such a way that it feels like you're getting 10+ zones instead of 6As a negative, I do think there could have been more combat encounters, especially early on, which likely contributes to grumbling of the expansion being ""boring"". That said, the combat encounters that *are* on offer are all top-tier, and you can easily tell that CBU3 wanted to push players again after making things somewhat relaxed in Endwalker.I can't say that Dawntrail reaches the peak of Shadowbringers/Endwalker, but let's be real: we likely won't get something that hits as hard as those did for several expansions, as the team builds up new storylines for us to invest in. And that's okay! Even without the .1-.3 patches, I still rate this roughly as well as Heavensward, and I can't wait to see where things go from here.",1720389861,0,0,positive

76561197969058545,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is a polarizing expansion.On the one side people like or even love it, on opposing side people seem to dislike or even hate it.The biggest issues many critics have is the story, especially one specific NPC which like 3/4 of the whole story is revolving around around. This point is somewhat justified but in my opinion not because of the ""personality"" but rather because the player's character basically was degraded to a traveler companion, almost felt like a NPC.The story itself wasn't bad. The first half had a somewhat jolly mood, felt lighthearted etc. Also it felt a bit predictable but still offered the possibility to different outcomes.The second half of the story was quite unexpected and basically introduced a second storyline which had a darker tone mood-wise. Also the concept the story picked up was a rather complex one in my opinion. Easy enough to understand but leaves enough to ponder about if one is into that thing. Pretty deep stuff in my opinion.Nevertheless, I can say that I enjoyed the story and the certain NPC wasn't bothering me at all but like I said, the player takes a back seat story-wise (which is okay, can't always be in the spotlight ^^)One other point that critics had is the lack of job-changes.Compared to Endwalker there have been only minor changes. But that's a point alot of players are glad about it, though. That's a thing that has been discussed for like 50-100 years, now. Some ppl want it to be a game that makes From Software games a laugh, others want it to be a clicker-game. My opinion is, it could be harder and offer more midcore-content instead of catering only hardcore players and casual players.Job-wise I think the game does a good job, despite the fact that jobs don't feel that unique like they did a couple of years back.What I liked the most so far are the dungeons.They are beautifully designed and I think the later dungeons have some pretty interesting designs and mechanics that are a little more challenging compared to the casual-stuff we got in the earlier expansions. I hope Square continues this path and makes more interesting dungeons (would also be totally fine if they added 2 difficulties for expert-dungeons or something like that. Casual-Expert-Dungeon (what we have, now) and harcore-expert-dungeon (without having to need a static group))If I had to rank it between the other addons:1. Shadowbringers 9,5/102. Endwalker 9.0/103.

It spends a lot of time with ideas of culture, history, the qualities required of a leader, and also how the quality of your allies affects your path in life. Good, supportive friends will put you back on the path when you fall off, while manipulative people will do everything they can to keep you off of it, but if you go alone you will have no guidance and lose your way all the same. All of which leads to Wuk Lamat becoming the leader her people need her to be in order to secure their future and honor their past. It's a story that makes sense and gives itself time to breathe and develop, not just to build up and payoff within its own context but also to establish themes and concepts that will likely be recurring for the next 10 years. However, a lot of people don't have the patience for that kind of narrative these days, hence the backlash. But a lot of people also like to talk like they are correct about everything, so play it yourself and judge for yourself, don't look to reviews to guide your opinion.As for gameplay, they definitely spiced things up quite a bit and I feel the experience is overall a lot more rewarding and exciting, despite the fact that it's also more difficult.

76561198035405035,0,0,english,"So people have been harsh and critical of this expansion. Its not entirely without reason, certain flaws with quest design and story pacing are more evident here than they have been in a long time precisely because the format has hardly changed in that time... however, as the first tangible step on the game's new story arc, it had an awful lot to achieve, and for the most part I feel it nails it. The new characters are all fleshed out well, the world-building is excellent and the call backs actually sort of stunned me a bit. Dungeon and Trial design is about as solid as its ever been, and by that I mean its pretty damn stellar!Like I said, it has issues. Existing characters don't always feel like they have enough to do, some new actors in the EN dub could have been given better direction (my guess is the US actors had a different studio than the one used previously). One character is so omnipresent that if you enjoy her a lot less than I did you might find the whole experience oppressive (for the record, I think shes great). Honestly, the first visit to the fourth zone could have been cut back so that more time could have been spent on the second half...But overall, I had a really good time with Dawntrail, and it does make me excited to see where the game goes in the future, and that's the important thing. Is it Shadowbringers or Endwalker? No, and it isn't trying to be. My only takeaway is that I hope the devs sift through the negativity with a fine toothed comb and actually identify the issues they need to address going forward, so that the end of this arc is as good as the last one, because this is definitely a strong beginning!",1720385602,1,0,positive
76561198044283122,0,0,english,"Relatively Spoiler Free Review :)I'll get the controversial part out of the way first; the [u]MSQ[/u].So, I came into this expac with the expectations of an ARR revisit. This is the first story that comes after a long 10 year saga, so I expected it to drag while setting up new locations and cultures and characters - and admittedly, it did do exactly that. The first quarter of the story is fairly tedious, and the pacing of the introduction of the first 3 new towns/cultures coulda used some work. If you read everything and don't skip any scenes, a single quest in the early sections of the story can sometimes take upwards of an hour. It's a little ridiculous tbh. However, once you meet ""The Big Bois"" the pacing of introducing new cultures and areas becomes a lot better, and a lot more interesting too! But that's not the main gripe people have with the MSQ. The main gripe people have is with Wuk Lamat - and it's a completely reasonable one to have. Wuk EATS screentime like nobody else. If you don't like her character, or miss her way too subtle growth at the start of the MSQ, you're likely going to be suffering through this expansion. Personally, I'm a Wuk enjoyer. but even I got tired of seeing her all the time. I wish the focus of the story was shared a bit more with Krile / Erenville - or even the twins. Honestly? I kinda hate the twins - especially and mostly Alisaie. But this could've been a chance to do /something/ with them. Instead they are glorified Trust NPCs that stand around and offer minor quips every now and then. I'd rather they not even be there at all if they were just going to do nothing and repeat what everyone else is saying. Also, like all of Alisaie's quips were annoying and boiled down to ""I'm not judging this new culture but.. *judges the culture*"" god i hate her- ANYWAYSThe second major gripe people have is with the WoL being sidelined in favor of Wuk. Personally, I 100% respect the decision to put the WoL in a mentor-like role (I think the idea of becoming that mysterious adventurer who's Seen Some Shit and just hangs around to give advice / only take care of the BIG problems is pretty badass tbh). I get people have different tastes, but I think this is a good direction for the WoL to go in, especially after Endwalker.Overall, I enjoyed the MSQ after slogging through the first quarter of it.Ok main stuff out of the way; speedrun times![u]Zones[/u] - Great! Fun! Lots of cool places to explore even after the MSQ! Wish some of them were actually involved in the MSQ because of how cool they were though!!![u]Music[/u] - Slaps! Another great time! Hell yeah more please!!![u]Combat[/u] - okay so... I play monk. I've played monk for 90% of my playtime and will likely continue to do so. I do not like current monk. They're reworking monk /yet again/ in the very first patch because they never know what they want to do with this class. I am frustrated,,, but also used to this frustration because it happens every expansion :) Love monk yipee it's a new job every expansion woooooo- Anyways aside from Monk being dog, Viper is a very simple and boring class to play, but people have already complained enough about how ""busy""???? it is??????????? so it'll be simplifed even more come the next patch. yay :) can't speak for any other classes cos i don't play them :) Dungeons and Trials were great!!! Some of the fights were surprisingly difficult for MSQ fights!

Some characters [spoiler] Koana, Cahcuia, Sphene [/spoiler], Erenville, etc.. are excellently written.  However, as many suggest below Wuk Lamat is anything but.  She is whiny, young, and seems to ruin a lot of serious moments.  ""Why are you recommending this though?""FF14 is an MMO, the majority of the time you play is NOT the story, and basing the expansion simply on the story, is not fair in my opinion.The graphics update is gorgeous, they did an excellent job.They added many quality of life changes, combat prompts, additional housing space, additional dyes, mounts, minions, and gold saucer content.The dungeons are beautiful, the fights are once again unique and interesting.The new classes are unique and fun to play.The things you should care about for an MMO are here, and continue to be improved and worked upon.  Don't write this off or give it a bad review solely because of the MSQ.  And also we need to understand that they needed to create and build a new world for the WoL since Endwalker was the end.

76561198051627501,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is an expansion of 2 sides the gameplay additions/changes alongside new content, and then there's the story. With the former I think the Dev team has nailed it and early impressions I'm having the most fun I've had with XIV in a long time. I can see myself regularly logging in to do side activities, harder battle content, and catching up on older stuff I previously ignored because I burnt myself out. On the flip side the story was kind of a disappointment. Like generally speaking I enjoyed it, but it was definitely flawed and at times felt like a worse re-hashing of certain story beats that have already occurred in Shadowbringers/Endwalker. Wuk Lamat's (our pseudo main protagonist this expansion) characterization was sort of up and down for me and how she was used in the narrative. I don’t have strong negative feelings about her like some people out there and the vitriol she seems to be receiving to me is unjustified. However the way the writers push her onto the audience can sometimes feel overbearing. Ironically compared to some others I enjoyed the first half of the game more than the second story wise. The ""mentorship"" PoV (attempt at it) was actually a nice change of pace honestly, even if held back a bit since the WoL by nature is a silent protagonist (with little discernible input beyond flavor text options unfortunately). Also I did not care for the shōnen protagonist gags/quirks they pushed hard on Wuk Lamat, weird pacing issues, and the odd tonal shifts. Although I do wish they added more scenes or solo duties where we’re shown training her hands on during the rite or at least have Wuk Lamat's values/beliefs challenged more. And the first half of the expac already dragged on quite a bit therefore I’m not sure where they’d fit that.Then there are other characters that seemed to be highlighted in the trailer that barely got any screentime or plot relevance unless for deus ex machina reasons/trusts/exposition dumps. As well as ancillary characters like Krile and Erenville that are done a bit dirty since they had important roles at least lore wise, but their arcs felt underdeveloped and abrupt when things came to an end. Especially when they had some more emotional moments that I wanted to feel more invested in, but weren't given enough time to fully bloom. For me it felt like certain story beats/plot devices did not get the attention they deserved, while in other circumstances we spent too much time meandering on things that were ultimately inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Which made the pacing feel super rough and FFXIV is known to have stretches even in ""good"" expansions where this is a problem. However in those expansions that we praise they're at worst usually tolerable, or best case scenario a needed breather before the next climax.I think Natsuko Ishikawa has stepped back and the writing team is the one that did ""Myth's of the Realm"" and the ""Zero/Golbez arc"" which shows for better and worse. I'm hoping like gameplay wise with the battle team this expansion that the writing team can get out of their comfort zone and not rely on storytelling conventions XIV has done already or at least repeated a lot recently in the near future. We need a Villain at this point who is just pure evil (Someone we love to hate), and not someone who we're suppose to sympathize with at the end. And I would like more personal stakes for the WoL/Group outside of new characters and places they introduce to us as we go on new adventures. Something that might be controversial to the wider fanbase, but would make the consequences and threats of our adventures feel ""real"" if that makes any sense to keep us on edge. We may need an expansion story wise where we don't ""win"" in the traditional sense and just survive having to live with the aftermath and slowly move forward even if that reality is painful. That could also be a segway into adding another crafting restoration piece of content as well.Once again though game content and just how it feels to play XIV right now is great. Dungeons/Trials looked awesome and felt like they really tested the player. I was floor tanking a lot more than in the past, and even struggled more than usual with certain mechanics they've implemented. Some of which were remixed in entirely new ways, and some unseen creative mechanics whose variations could add more spice in the future. They seem to be trying to raise the skill floor of the playerbase with the new content which is a good thing overall. Can't speak on the new exploration zone or other stuff we'll get, but it looks super promising. Viper was also awesome, haven't messed with Picto but the consensus I've seen has been very positive with the new jobs and what they bring to the table. Also the graphics update really makes the game pop visually a lot more. It's both subtle, but in other ways very noticeable in the general visual presentation. All while not being that much more demanding in relation to the system requirements. And the new hub towns alongside their tunes are awesome. The only song I wasn't crazy about is ""Smile"" which is the sister theme to ""Open Sky"" the front and center main theme of Dawntrail. It comes off as a super corny late 90s/Early 00s 'direct-to-video' Disney Movie ED song. Although the leitmotifs from it used in other tracks like in the Tuliyollal town themes are nice. Just ""Smile"" itself is kind of grating on the ears, to me at least.I'm rating this as positive mainly because it's fun to play. But the story will leave some people lacking as shown by the mixed response here on Steam and it's understandable. For me this is around the same quality if not arguably just slightly better than base Stormblood narrative wise. However it's a noticeable step down or two from Heavensward, Endwalker, and Shadowbringers' base MSQs. At the very least the world building and expanded lore in DT that the writing team are able to draw upon can add a lot to future expansions. How the various reveals and macguffins in this expac will be eventually used is to be seen. Looking forward to seeing how the team pivots in the patch content and what that may mean for 8.0. Yoshi-P said the reaction of the wider playerbase will sort of dictate how the story will go since they don't plan that far ahead and just pull on open threads to continue the tale until they feel they can move towards a resolution that makes sense like with the Hydaelyn/Zodiark Saga. Edit: I'm especially excited for the Return to Vana'diel Alliance Raid series, and the exploration zone/field operations when we get to the patches that will introduce those pieces of content.",1720375862,38,1,positive
76561198066331853,272339,2,brazilian,"TL;DR: Expansão 7/10MAPA 8/10: A expansão tem uma boa coleção de mapas. Os iniciais são agraveis, nada muito memorável, mas tem 2 em especial que acertaram em cheio: o mapa de velho oeste/Texas e a cidade Cyberpunk muito bem feita, uma das minhas favoritas. Além disso, a cidade de Tuliyollal é muito agradável, melhor que muitas cidades do jogo, só perdendo para Kugane.Músicas 8/10: Este é outro ponto que se destaca na expansão, com ótimas músicas no início e na maioria dos mapas. Tuliyollal é incrível tanto dia quanto noite. Algumas batalhas têm ótimas OSTs que tornam as lutas mais épicas, mas na batalha final, a música deixa a desejar, ficando sem impacto e pouco memorável. Não esperava algo como ""Who Brings Shadow"", mas algo mais próximo de Zeromus. Se tivessem acertado na luta final, talvez a última batalha tivesse sido um pouco melhor (duvido).Combate 9/10: Ambas as classes são bem divertidas à primeira vista, Pintomancer é divertido e colorido com magias legais de se usar, só precisa de algo que deixe mais fluído as pinturas porque pode ser chato ter que renovar e não fazer ""nada"" nesse meio tempo, Viper é super rápido mas não joguei o suficiente para identificar problemas mas ele e o Pintomancer tem de especial é o novo recurso de combinar em um botão habilidades de combos, tornando a gameplay mais fluida e reduzindo a preocupação do jogador. Só não foi um 10 porque isso precisa ser implementado de forma mais ampla nas outras classes. O combo de 1, 2, 3 hoje no jogo já não é mais viável. Muitas coisas acontecem na luta e se você pensar em trocar de job para jogar fica relativamente complicado. Se você não joga com a mesma classe por muito tempo, isso de 1, 2, 3 para combo normal é chato e força você a lembrar onde parou caso alguma mecanica aconteça e você foque 100% nela. Mas as classes parecem estar bem legais no geral. Só upei 4 até agora, então para ter uma noção completa, só quando todas estiverem no 100, e isso vai levar mais tempo.História 7/10: E aqui começa o drama da expansão com os reviwers. Com um convite claro e direto de Wuk Lamat, ela nos quer em sua comitiva, para ganhar a sucessão ao trono que ela ELA é a candidata. Vamos viver uma aventura DELA durante as MSQs, vendo o desenvolvimento DELA. Não sei qual a dificuldade dos jogadores em entenderem isso. É claro que vai haver um foco maior nela, e isso não é um problema, foi dito logo no início. Você aceitou ajuda-la em sua aventura na terra natal Tuliyollal, onde você é uma pessoa nova e estranha. Ela vai ter destaque, ela vai nos apresentar as coisas, ela vai nos dar a missão para resolver os problemas. [spoiler]Ela vai ser a contraparte de Sphene quando elas se enfrentarem para mostrar a visão de cada uma na história[/spoiler]. E isso não é problema.Agora, falando da história em si, acho que a expansão começou muito bem, lenta, apresentando tudo e todos com foco nos desafios, que podem ser simples. Sim, é uma história que já vimos em muitos lugares, mas é bem feita e eu adoro essa parte, mesmo quando precisamos parar para conhecer os pares envolvidos e os povos, tem uma boa razão. Isso casa muito bem com o que está sendo contado na MSQ. Acho que os problemas começam quando os desafios acabam, lá pela MSQ 95, onde a história dá uma pausa para conhecermos uma nova região e aí começa uma nova ameaça.Sphene e seu reino chegam cometendo atrocidades em Tuliyollal e saímos de lá com um foco muito claro em nossa missão. Quando precisamos parar para conhecer o povo desse novo reino, quebra o clima e a urgência de estarmos lá. Isso se repete não só em Solution Nine, mas também em Living Memory. Sei que na última cidade tem até dois bons motivos, Krille e Erenville, mas fora eles, o resto fica muito forçado na exploração. Temos algo para fazer e não estamos fazendo por causa de uma mensagem? Ou seria algo que na narrativa japonesa faria mais sentido? Não sei se isso é um problema, mas a forma como a história quer nos passar os motivos e a visão do antagonista é bem complicada essa parte. Acho que, nesse final, a narrativa ganha uma gordura extra que deixa o jogo desnecessariamente longo. Digo, em Solution Nine e Living Memory, em ambas as partes a narrativa dá uma pausa para nos mostrar um reino novo, com o intuito de nos conectarmos com esse povo ou até fazer uma ligação com seus costumes e os nossos em Tural(povo gigante) mas não funciona. Me lembra muito os problemas que tinha em toda Endwalker, mas aqui só aparece no final. Queria contar mais porém o limite de texto da steam baixo.A batalha final é muito fraca. O motivo é meio egoísta e Wuk a todo momento tenta ver isso como algo bom em algum nível, mas ela precisa parar o suposto ""amor pelo povo"" da outra rainha. E o boss é muito sem graça, sem carisma algum, só um robô gigante com braços extras, e suas mecânicas são igualmente simples. Achei que faltou muita coisa nessa batalha final. Até mesmo quando Wuk aparece, o clima não muda, ela nem mesmo faz algo impactante. Um ponto realmente fraco dessa batalha.Sobre Wuk Lamat / Lamaty'i: Ela é honesta clara no sentido de ser previsível, seu desenvolvimento é fraco depois que acaba os desafios quase nulo. Uma personagem que acha que entende o mundo e se acha mais do que realmente é, e por isso sofre. Com o tempo, não só ela, mas também nós, aprendemos mais sobre a cultura e os motivos que levaram Gulool Ja Ja a ser o grande líder de Tuliyollal. Ela aprende, cresce, e aos olhos dos roteiristas ela estava pronta para o trono, coisa que não achei. Acho que faltou para Wuk Lamat um trauma mais forte, algo para amadurecer ela e seus pensamentos. Acho que Shadowbringers tinha um tema mais maduro, aqui ficou muito infantil a paz que ela tanto queria alcançar e mesmo quando a guerra chegou em seu país, parece não ter mudado em nada a personagem. Continuou com discurso sobre paz mesmo estando em guerra. Acho que depois do arco da eleição é onde os problemas com Wuk Lamat começam. Ela fica perdida, precisando de temas mais complicados para lidar, mas ela ficou muito passiva com tudo e só queria, proteger seu povo e punir seu irmão, mas deu uma pausa para conhecer o povo do novo reino, e sem o mesmo bom motivo que nos levou a conhecer o povo de Tuliyollal no arco da eleição. Isso me deixou com gosto amargo na boca. Aqui é só porque a Lamaty'i queria e não porque tinha uma real necessidade. Mesmo que depois com Krille e Erenville o motivo estivesse bem claro.Acho que é injusto as críticas com ela, até o 95 MSQ ela funciona muito bem, obrigado. Mas no 98 ela só fica a mesma, não piora, mas também não agrada. Isso não torna a expansão ruim de forma alguma, só não faz ela ser lembrada como um Emet-Selch e não vai, mas me parece que o povo que veio de Shadowbringers ficou órfão depois de sua morte. Mas não posso me entender mais.Voltando para a história, acho que todos os personagens são bem apresentados. Bakool Ja Ja tem um bom aproveitamento, o fato do povo querer e sofrer com a bênção das duas cabeças e a quantidade de bebês que morreram no processo é bem traumático, coisa que vejam só a Wuk precisava e não teve. Zoraal Ja no final é bem triste, não aceitando sua derrota e ficando mágoa do pai por não deixar nada para ele. Por isso acho que o jogo não só foca em Wuk Lamat, mesmo sendo a história dela que estamos acompanhando.Sempre vai haver os idiotas que vão calcular quantas falas tal personagem tem. E isso não significa nada. Dizer que Krille não foi importante em Dawntrail ou que sua história não foi aproveitada só por causa de x ou y números de falas com a personagem é imbecil no mínimo. Quem jogou e leu sabe que ela teve o tempo necessário sem estender mais do que deveria, coisa que às vezes acontece com Wuk Lamat. Vejam só Bakool Ja Ja, Zoraal Ja Krille e Erenville todos são importantes para a história, mas o idiota achar que eles não tiveram 50% de falar na MSQ logo é só sobre Wuk Lamat, uma pena.Acho que a expansão fez um bom trabalho, não sem precisar reaproveitar nada.",1720375119,3,0,positive

76561197970357880,393425,1974,english,"I'm going to keep this as spoiler free for Dawntrail as I can.Story, I'd give about a 7 out of 10.  Not brilliant, but not bad either.The story is a bit slower and has a bit more cut-scene than previous.  Just like in Endwalker, if you want more combat during the main story progression, pick up side-quests. The only real difference is some of what would have been 'click the npc to read their chat box' type quests are now 'click the npc to get a cut scene' type quests.  Wuk Lamat seems to be the dividing line between 'I loved the expansion' and 'The story is rubbish'.  Personally, I think she has better development than some characters we've dealt with in the past.  I also broke up the cutscene chains up by doing some sidequests, to get a bit more 'punch things' style gameplay in while working through the MSQ.The other big difference is we don't have the whole 'the world is ending if you don't do this now, hurry, hurry, hurry!' sensation driving us forward.  Despite all the complaints, there is only one fewer solo duty than Shadowbringers and Endwalker everyone seems to forget how much the community as a whole complained about a few of those (Ran-jit fight, crawling in the snow solo duty.).The story is about half exposition and world building, but picks up pace later on.  It follows, more or less, the same narrative pattern that has been used since Stormblood, just without the fate of the world hanging in the balance from the get go.Combat Changes: 9/10 The dungeons and trials are fresh and challenging.  Even the level 100 dungeons at current answer some of the call for making things more challenging.  SE really seems to have stepped up their game here.  The dungeons feel more mechanically difficult and require more healing to get through then we've been used to.  The trails have new and interesting things that are signs that the raid series is going to be especially interesting this time around.Classes got tweaked but, for the most part, in a rather subtle way instead of fully redefining them, except Monk (which I haven't played yet, so won't be commenting on.)   The new classes fill interesting niches.  Pictomancer... it's somewhere between Black Mage and Summoner.  There is a lot of heavy casting, but the short cast time vs GCD time keeps it rather mobile with big timed bursts to play around.  Viper feels like the illegitimate love child of reaper and ninja.  It's a rather busy class with the APM of ninja and the tick/tock movement patterns of reaper.I'd have actually said they knocked it out of the part, and this is the gameplay content I was looking for, except for one of the level 100 dungeons that has a few mechanics no one seems to want to deal with.Graphics Upgrade:Unlike 'that other game', when the graphics were overhauled the characters kept their identity.  Skin tones look and are textured better, materials are identifiable.  Viera and Hrothgar still have a lack of hats.  The scenery looks a lot better, even in the old zones.  I'm very pleased with this.  Some people needed to slightly tweak their eye color or darken/lighten their skin tones a bit, but the free fantasia to do just that kind of makes up for it, I think.",1720374759,1,0,positive

I'm assuming this is because the graphic update took up huge parts of the budget, so there wasn't as much for voice acting.-I would have enjoyed a solo duty like the one from ""In From the Cold"" in Endwalker-It would have been nice to have some more hinting to the secrets of Act 2 in Act 1Overall, a solid entry in the game, and I'm looking forward to what comes next!",1720371589,1,0,positive

I like how my character looks,  I like the new lighting,  the textures, and all that.   Gorgeous areas,  got a lot better,  I love how the worlds just feels,  of coarse some of the hard light moments  where it needed that black shadows  don't hit as hard,   but overall a good  change.Gameplay:  The classes I played seem very much how they always played.   Of coarse,   the game really wanted to challenge the player this time with some of the mechanics.   This  expansion dungeons and bosses, are far more chaotic making it a Black Mage's  worst nightmare.   but glad they gave us a good difficulty spike.   But still in the end it is kind of formulaic at times and still very  much how you expect from FFXIV,  which can be a bad or a good thing.Story:  Here is where contriversy comes a lot.  I know they are trying to do a fresh start,   and I know this was going to go it own way other then but overall it is very fun,  but I find it better then Endwalker.    To be fair,  Endwalker  had to wrap up 10 years of story in an Expansion,   but that doesn't mean it wasn't  Dialogue heavy,  with a lot of Dry spots that it left you less engaged.  Dawntrail in my opinion is a bettter paced game,  I didn't find any big dry spells like I did with Stormblood and  Endwalker,  but I found myself at a impasse that it wasn't the best story overall.   The beginning is pretty lighthearted,  a very vacation style story in the beginning and then just ramp up with later half.   While I disagree with how the story played out,  I still say was decent.   I can see why people dislike the first half and I also can see how people displeased with the options at the end,  but I felt content with it.I think the major thing about this is that,   it is not really your  Characters story.    This story is about  Wuk Lamat,  and even though you are part of it,  it is more of us being the side character unlike the former expansions,    and it just very different.Overall:  I think it is very much a good expansion,  I won't say it is better in every aspect but I do feel like it was a fair starting point for what ever we may come across later on.",1720370140,1,0,positive

Even the movement in dungeons or trails are well implemented. The graphics are wonderful and overall bring such a good feeling to the game and it's optimized really well. Lost about 10fps overall with the overhaul and other games with the graphics change I would have lost about 20-30fps most likely. The Bad: The story is not a ""End of the World"" type of deal. Some people don't like it. I'm a serial cutscene skipper so it doesn't matter. I watched another player go through it and it was a good vibe overall, well made, stands on its own when the other stories needed to build off the previous expansions to even function as a story.They added 2 new classes which are both DPS which leads to an insane queue time for DPS, but, well.

The story also primary features Wuk Lamat's journey and your enjoyment of the story is somewhat directly related to your investment into the characterPros:- Visual fidelity was massively improved with the graphics update- Zones and Music are excellent- There is enjoyment to be gained from sidestories/general fleshing out of the new cultures you meet.- Combat content is probably the best it has been in a while.- Excellent Solo-InstancesCons:- Somewhat formulaic MSQ- Quest-Design is still the same ""Go to A, talk to B; interact sometimes"" that we had in the previous expansion- In a similiar vein: While dungeons and trials are excellent, there is barely any combat in between that lasts more than a few attacks.In Conclusion: While debatably maybe not as good as the previous expansion, Dawntrail still has strengths worth experiencing and I have high hopes for the future of the combat content",1720367400,37,2,positive

76561198322049224,170379,5666,english,"Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail presented a unique opportunity to the writers of FFXIV. Though it was eventually salvaged into an excellent final product, the initial saga of Final Fantasy XIV got off to a rocky start, only truly finding its stride in the Shadowbringers expansion - so having definitively ended that saga in the previous expansion, Endwalker, the writers finally had the opportunity to start a brand new story from nothing this time around - and they produced a masterpiece. Dawntrail as an expansion was always going to have to provide on three fronts. First and foremost, it had to deliver a more low-stakes, understated plot to provide narrative downtime after the astronomical heights that the previous expansion reached. Second, it paradoxically also had to have high enough stakes to warrant its own existence - with greater difficulty in gameplay content to match. Third, it had to serve as a solid foundation upon which to build FFXIV's next saga. Somehow, despite all odds, I believe Dawntrail delivers upon and surpasses these criteria. The new cast members are instantly loveable, and newcomer Wuk Lamat in particular is both a joy to interact with and the arguable main character of the expansion, whose growth we follow on what might best be described as a road trip across a new continent. A little over half of the expansion is spent following her through slow-paced, but very engaging and comfortable worldbuilding. The continent of Tural, which serves as the expansion's setting, is densely packed and well thought-out featuring interesting map design and even more interesting lore, packed with various cultures inspired by the ancient indigenous South American peoples. Though Dawntrail is lighthearted and fun for the most part, that isn't to say it has no weight to it - on the contrary, the emotional beats in this expansion hit harder than in any expansion prior, with some of the most engaging character writing in the game yet. Having burned through it in little under a week, I give Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail a 9/10, where it takes its place, tied with Shadowbringers as my favourite expansion in the game.",1720364132,2,0,positive
76561198264479607,0,0,english,"To sum up my feelings in one line so you don't need to read further if you don't want to: Dawntrail might be my personal favorite expansion (on release), but it might not be for everyone.Battle Content, Job Balance, & Gathering/Crafting:The job changes and adjustments to the pacing of dungeons, trials, and high-end content has made the game feel more frenetic and tense than ever. Dawntrail is entirely willing to frequently flood your screen with layers and layers of AOE markers to keep you moving and on your toes, a welcome change from the frequently stagnant dungeon bosses of Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The trials are inventive and climactic, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to the raid content after trudging through the dreaded Party Finder for the extremes. Job balance itself needs a hand, as things seem lopsided at the moment. But as always, expansion launches are hardly where the meta will settle. There is very little I, as a veteran of four expansion since late Heavensward, can say as to where one might find issues in their current design philosophy regarding jobs and their balance. While I would adore some of Stormblood's more janky rotations to make a comeback, I have to recognize that such a change would be to the game's detriment.As to crafting and gathering, you'll find the experience much the same as previous expansions. Hand/Land jobs are still leveled primarily through leves. There are still master recipes. There are still tomes of folklore. Nothing here has surprised me, but it has given me a chance to - as always - truly explore the areas the expansion released.Narrative & World - Spoiler Free:This expac's MSQ is, perhaps, the one I've most enjoyed on release. Shadowbringers and Endwalker were extremely good experiences, which played on grand scales of world-class threats. They were melodramas that reveled in existential themes and grand stakes. Dawntrail is not that kind of story. In it, the Warrior of Light takes on the role of the weathered, experienced mentor to the young and unsteady Wuk Lamat. Though some players might miss being in the spotlight, I thoroughly enjoyed watching her journey from the sideline and getting to see how we impacted her. Several of the characters in Dawntrail's narrative left me hungry for more scenes and content that revolves around them, instead of us. I do wish we would further divorce the narrative from the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, some of whom are present for this journey, but I suppose seeing old favorites return is never wholly bad. The tone can be a lot lighter than the previous several expansions, but supposing you're willing to lean back and enjoy some campy dialogue here or there it's a good time. I never felt as though the narrative wasn't taking itself seriously, even if I did laugh at one or two moments.In regards to the expansion's new locations as a place to inhabit and live within throughout your journey, few places in Etheirys have left me quite so enthralled as Tural. Its jungles, mountains, and swamps - loaded with perfect vistas and awesome monsters - have lived rent-free in my head since the early-access period. Few regions in FFXIV have gotten stuck in my head quite like all of the zones in Dawntrail have. The graphical update was plainly utilized in every fiber of this expansion, and few moments from earlier expansions have left me quite as breathless from the beauty of what I was looking at.At the end of my journey on release, I found myself despserately wanting more. I want to see more of the characters we met here in Tural, and hope that Square and CBU3 iterate on what they set the groundwork for here. By the end of our initial step into the MSQ, it truly feels like we could go from here to anywhere. The sky is the limit, and I've never been more excited and hopeful for the future of FFXIV.",1720363792,1,0,positive

I absolutely adore the inclusivity of the cultures, it's clear where the inspiration of the locations & main city comes from and I think they implemented it really well and respectfully. Learning about the difference of culture in the tribes from Eorzea to Tural was also really interesting to me and I enjoyed getting some lore from those quests.I also love the new mechanics of dungeons/trials and I feel they really touched base on everything I was hoping for in new content. A lot of the mechanics I have personally never seen before so it was really fun to experience for the first time and I’m super excited to see what the raid series are like when they are added. The new adjustments to quality of life (especially with crafting and gathering) I have really liked as well. I really enjoyed levelling all my DoL/DoH to 100 with these improvements!However, I will say the MSQ is pretty average, which is super unfortunate. I love this game and I play mostly for the story, but this felt so rushed and lack lustre to me. A lot of the story felt like a time waste in a way. It also felt super predictable with the villains, as we've seen all of this stuff before especially during Endwalker.Some of the scenes were really attention grabbing and heartfelt, but a lot of them were boring to me. I loved the new characters and I truly think Wuk's character development throughout the story was great. The focus on Krile and Erenville as characters was also really interesting to me except I felt a lot of the ideas were halted and the ending was super rushed. The last zone was the quickest to finish and it felt so wrong because the lead up was so dramatic. There’s a lot of plot holes in this MSQ and I am super on the fence about it. I just expected so much more, especially how it was hyped up to be a whole new story with new experiences; which I felt was only clear in the cultural aspect ;w; I also wish they would have put more time into voiced scenes, there's a few memorable moments I wish were voiced (and I know a lot of people would have skipped because they weren't). I also noticed a lot of restrictions with travelling; such as being unable to go on things that seemed like you'd be able to (zone 6: if you know you know), and being unable to climb up surfaces that you would easily be able to get up.Overall MY opinion of placement for all stories now are: Shb > EW > SB > DT > HW > ARR.It definitely saddens me to put DT so low.",1720361562,29,1,positive

76561198052338448,0,0,english,"Overall, this was a good expansion. While it doesn't hit the peaks of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, it definitely did enough for me to feel like it was a worthy successor, and is a reassuring first step into FFXIV's new saga.TL;DR: Very good, but dialogue heavy, and a new character is the main focus, meaning that not liking her may tarnish your DT enjoyment as well.The main things to be aware of are that the narrative shifts away from our Warrior of Light as the main character, and instead passes the spotlight to the third promise, Wuk Lamat. Our character instead takes on the role of her mentor and enforcer (when necessary). As a result, your overall enjoyment of the story hinges entirely on whether or not you like Wuk Lamat. In my opinion, she was a very enjoyable character with well-written growth and development. The other element to be aware of is the pacing of the story & gameplay. In Stormblood, there was a solo duty very early on into the experience, which caused major issued at launch due to the servers for maintaining the single player instances getting completely full, resulting in players being unable to continue the MSQ. Because of this, the team takes more precautions in designing the early game to avoid similar issues. As you're exploring your first two leveling zones, you will not be getting involved in any major scuffles to test your mettle. Combine that with the first two zones being very exposition heavy due to the narrative involving learning about the cultures and people of Tural, and you will be jonesing to get into a real fight in-game.Once you get past that hurdle, things improve significantly, though I think being unaware of the circumstances and the slow pacing can definitely leave a bad first impression. This expansion is a little more cutscene heavy than the previous ones, or at least it feels that way. The game would've benefited a lot from one or two more solo duties sprinkled throughout. That said, the combat in dungeons and trials is A+ and when it comes to the story, once the ball gets rolling, it's hard to stop it, especially at the end. There's a lot of intrigue propping up the second half of the Dawntrail experience that kept me hooked and playing as long as I could to keep experiencing what's next, and I can safely say that our fun little adventure for adventure's sake ends up escalating into a grand journey with a threat suiting the Warrior of Light that went to the edge of existence.",1720340296,1,0,positive
76561198819789428,0,0,english,"i liked dawntrail! a lot actually! it is not a bad expansion, i'd even say it's a great one. (obviously not as good as shadowbringers or endwalker, but those are like my favorite games of all time (if my meteion pfp didnt tell you already)) i just think it's not everyone's cup of tea. i'm admittedly a new player, who started less than a year ago and this is my first expansion drop, but i had so much fun with this! but there are a few things that i do feel like need to be said.psa! this is all my opinion! i wrote this at 1 am on a whim because i felt like dt was getting a lot of flack mostly for being not as good as shb/ew, which i think is mostly unwarranted because dt is really its own thing and the start of a new storyline. that is, again, my opinion. you are welcome to disagree with everything i say (just dont be mean about it) but now on to the actual review :)some people have said this already, but your enjoyment can really be boiled down to two things:1) do you like wuk lamat?2) are you okay with sitting through several cutscenes in a row?if your answer to one is no, then you will not like dawntrail. dawntrail is wuk lamat's expansion, it's her journey to becoming a fitting dawnservant and it very VERY heavily focuses on her, her actions and interactions etc. if you find her annoying, you wont like the story because 90% if not more of the cutscenes have wuk lamat in them. on top of that, the wol and the scions take a back seat this expansion. and by back seat, i mean wuk lamat and erenville are in the pilot seat, the wol and krile are in economy, and everyone else is in the baggage compartment. i love the scions, dont get me wrong, but besides krile, they've all had their times to shine and develop. them taking the backseat allows for the new characters this expansion to get the development that, if the scions had been more prominent, i dont think they would have gotten. i do wish there was a bit more of them, but im also glad they gave room for the new characters to shine.if the answer to two is no, then you'll find this expansion boring and wanting for more fights and content. thats not to say the fights are bad, on the contrary the trials (ESPECIALLY the last two) are some of the best that ffxiv has ever come out with, and have some absolute BANGERS for the osts. what combat there is in dawntrail is extremely fun and amazing to play with some really cool mechanics. you have to wait a WHILE between them though, and there were only 3-4 solo duties through the whole expansion. so if you're here for the fights and mostly/only the fights, you'll also find dawntrail lacking.i happen to both like wuk lamat and be okay with just sitting and watching cutscenes for a while. i also went through the entire thing from start to finish with a friend which always helps. but dawntrail is by no means bad. it has some rough patches, but every expansion does. (though its post patch, the mayoral election between your two big final ascian fights is a little weird, and to me all of the stuff with getting the forums permission in endwalker was really annoying, especially with how fourchenault treated the twins)being built for the new lighting engine, dawntrail looks absolutely stunning. tuliyollal is by far my favorite city now since it actually feels lived in compared to the others, in my opinion. yak tel was stunning, especially the lower half. shaaloani and its wild west misadventures was also fun little side romp between the two major arcs of the story! on top of that, the final area is absolutely stunning the first time you visit. nothing is ever going to top ultima thule/the tempest as a final area, but they did pretty damn good all things considered.like i said earlier, dawntrail is not for everyone. i adore this expansion and its characters though, and IF the msq really turns you off, i think you should at least try and play through all the expansion because i do think the fights are worth it. maybe wait for the raids to release/the eden ultimate release to be officially announced so you have more bang for your buck when you do actually buy it. and if you don't want to do all of that, then that's fine. one last thing before i go:i'm BEGGING you, if you do nothing else PLEASE listen to the final trials theme because it is one of the best in this game.",1720339982,0,0,positive
76561198094380789,0,0,english,"""After 9 years of playing this game, with the story finally concluded, here's my take on Dawntrail:Dawntrail is truly a remarkable expansion, as they promised.Story: I'd rate it 5/10 for the first half and 8/10 for the second. The latter part was particularly engaging, but the overemphasis on Wuk Lamaty felt excessive. While I appreciate her character, I wished the latter half focused more on the Warrior of Light and the Scions. I felt sidelined, despite saving the very stars at the end of the universe. More involvement would have been gratifying.Map Design: An absolute 10/10. The maps are breathtakingly beautiful, undoubtedly the best aspect of the expansion for me. The map design is where Dawntrail truly shines. It sets a new standard for the expansion's launch content.Battle Design and Content: I give it a solid 9/10. However, as a healer, the inability to withstand a single damaging skill is frustrating beyond belief!The latter part of the story left me eagerly anticipating what's next. The narrative took a compelling turn, leaving me hungry for more.The battle content continues to improve and excite. The two new classes, Pictomancer and Viper, are my absolute favorites. I give them both a perfect 10/10, though I'm baffled by the absence of poisons in the Viper's arsenal.In conclusion, although the second half of the story could have been more focused and the first less, Dawntrail is undeniably a hit. Its stunning map design, evolving battle content, trials and dungeons make it a standout despite narrative reservations.""",1720336975,1,0,positive

The story may not be perfect, but I like the direction it took with us as not being the definitive main character, especially following Endwalker where it gets a bit grating just being treated as the ""almighty warrior of light"".I personally can overlook the slight errors in the story for the overall narrative it tells. The first half can feel a bit sluggish, but the second half is an enjoyable main story experience. I wish square enix would part from their MSQ formula in the future, as it can still be predictable when dungeons and trials will show up if you pay attention to the level of the quests (though this makes sense for leveling dungeons)Aside from this, the dungeons and trials currenly added have taken a turn to be slightly more difficult, and from what I've seen so far this is very promising for the future content of the game. The job changes have been... concerning in some cases to say the least. Some jobs (MNK, BLM etc) that had optimised rotations have had their skill ceilings dulled down while not actually making the job any easier to pick up, leading to a more shallow job overall where players who had skill expression previously have been punished while not actually helping newer players.Most other jobs have not changed much apart from just having one big button added, and some QoL added. In saying that, square enix has stated that this is due to the fact that they are making a significant shift in content difficulty (which can be seen as present), and did not want to overwhelm the player base with ""too much new stuff"".Having to wait potentially 3 years for some semblance of individuality in jobs leaves a sour taste in my mouth and I can only hope Square enix attempts to expand on jobs during this expansion rather than waiting.",1720329806,1,0,positive

Without spoiling, it's about her growth as a potential ruler, and the aftermath of it, making the Warrior of Light more of a sidekick than the main character, which is a nice touch in my opinion as a call back to our roots. The story itself is much, much lighter than the previous ones, bringing a welcome change of pace. The expansion is very, very focused on story telling, and it delivers quite a bit.

And the design choice of adding complexity to encounters rather than an increasingly complex rotation or more buttons to press. If there's one piece of criticism I have it's that with Endwalker I felt we had a few more interesting solo trials (playing as a garlean soldier, thancred metal gear solid, etc.) that we didnt get here, and I would have liked to see more of those to break up some of the typical mmo staples of ""run here and do a quest"". But I loved the story and really want to see where things continue to go. To people comparing this to other expansions, this is certainly much much better than ARR as a setup, and I personally liked it more pacing wise than either Heavensward or Stormsblood (which both honestly are probably remembered fondly because of their x.3 patch more so than the base expansion).

76561198067071973,228640,258,english,"I think the reviews on this have been a bit harsh. I enjoy this expansion up to this point.The start is a bit slow but I think the thing to remember is that we just got off of the high of a pretty heavy expansion. It'd be like if ARR started with Heavensward. It wouldn't have the same weight it did because we don't have any personal connection to the npcs. We are building connections for the future and while I haven't fully finished the MSQ the part that people have mainly complained about I have gotten past.I'll give a few good and bad points with some neutral ones as well so an informed decision can be made for future buyers.Pros - The graphical update that came from this expansion was heavily needed and has made the game look fantastic in comparison to before.- The actual encounter design has improved significantly. The fights are a good difficulty and reflect the likely hundreds of hours someone who is playing this expansion might have.- The new areas themselves look gorgeous and are something that I actually wanted to explore in comparison to areas in Stormblood and Heavensward. They added multiple fast travel points between the area in the zone so it isn't like the Heavensward area that has only 1 teleport at the bottom and the area is gigantic. - The 2 new jobs are some of my favorite to play, with Pictomancer being the job I am planning on raiding with and doing the future ultimates on.Neutral- The story is not as focused on your character and instead focuses more on Wuk Lamat, a character new to this expansion who your character is helping. While I enjoy this aspect of the expansion I could see where someone wants the more self focused expansions of Heavensward/Shadowbringers/Endwalker.- The job gameplay for the non new jobs is mostly the same besides the reworked jobs. If you already liked a job you'll have more of what you like,  if you don't like a job you will have more you don't like. A personal gripe here is Summoner not having any complexity added to their pretty simple rotation, but it is a beginner friendly job due to this.Cons- The questing formula for MSQ is still the same as in previous expansions. If you know the standard when you get a dungeon, when you get a trial, when you get to a new area you already know what you're expecting in timing. - Along with the previous point, quest design has not changed much. You still have the talk to npc, talk to another npc, talk to another npc quests. However at this point if you're this far into MSQ you should understand what that comes with, including the extra story.",1720300419,0,0,positive

I can't understand the backlash that's been given to this Xpac for ""lazy writing"". Our character arc after Endwalker is reset to stage 1; we're just adventurers again. The story following Wuk Lamat isn't as bad as people say, we're just the mentor this time around and honestly it's not that bad. After doing a world ending apocalypse I feel that our character is justified to just sit back and relax after those events, we don't need constant one-upping-stakes to make the game feel good. You know what game did that and crashed horribly before they reset with their latest Expansion? World of Warcraft. Most of these bad reviewers probably have never played any other MMO and can't fully comprehend that to start a new expansion saga, we need to start slow and establish an opening. Now for people saying it's boring for 70% of it, I'm going to be dead honest, it's not. We are told to help the next successor, not BE the successor. Why would we interfere with that? it's not always going to be about us. I think people refusing to let the connecting societies of Tural share their lore and world building are the same ones that get mad when a story doesn't have any lore at all or it feels ""artificial"". If you got rid of those building blocks, Tural would just be one giant copy paste of a continent. The characters are written well and I'm starting to assume most people have a terrible outlook on life to want edginess and depression in every character. They cannot stand positive and normal people I swear. The contradictions in the reviews here are also hilarious, ""Wuk Lamat is a mary sue!! She's USELESS!!!"" ""WE DONT WANT OLD CHARACTERS, THEIR ARC IS DONE!!! WAIT WE HATE THE NEW CHARACTERS BRING THE OLD ONES BACK!!!"". People need to understand this is ARR for the new saga. It's not going to be bombastic like Endwalker since that was the end of a saga. The characters they are building have so much more room for growing. Take the original scions for instance, they were just boring people when we first met them; and they drastically changed in Heavensward. This saga without spoiling the end, has already laid the foundation to another great story and people are review bombing because they can't be bothered to read the start of a book.",1720296586,3,1,positive

It feels like a maintenance expansion, with graphical improvements across the entire game, more exciting encounter design for dungeons and trials, and finally a rework to address individuality across jobs is expected to arrive in patch 7.2.The Graphical improvements are lovely, music is fantastic in the new areas, and the new endgame hub area looks great. As a healer main, the new dungeons and trials are refreshingly difficult and you need to focus more on healing your teammates through high damage mechanics. I'm looking forward to the standard raids and hope they stay challenging.I enjoyed the story, characters and your WoL's place in it. A poor analogy I keep using is that it's like the Knives Out movies - like Benoit Blanc, you aren't the ""main"" character in this story, you're a mentor helping someone else along their journey while fighting off or outsmarting bad guys that would otherwise just kill your new friends immediately. I find it a neat way of framing your WoL's legend and experience. Where the story started to nag me is that [i] so much time [/i] goes to Wuk Lamat. While I like her character, so many other characters could have used an extra cutscene or two to explain their thoughts or conflicts. It's a small gripe that gradually built up over the story for me and by the end, I was really disappointed in how little other characters got time in the spotlight. Hopefully this nitpick can be made redundant in the 7.x story if they decide to revisit some characters and places.Overall still an enjoyable Main Scenario Quest, especially towards the second half.

What started as a new, fun adventure on a new continent quickly became a rollercoaster of emotions and suprises.

And yes, though I can understand why some people feel like they´ve lost their status as Main Characters which was carved more and more into stone with each MSQ addition before, we shouldn´t forget that this isn´t about us but the adventure itself. After all that´s what we are and what we started with back in ARR too. A new adventure on a new Continent. So why not catching a glimpse of new things, taking it easy, discover, explore, learn and help that sometimes a little too naive Wuk Lamat become the Queen she deserves to be while leaning back a bit in the well earned chair called Savior of the Universe, allowing others to take the lead... at least for a little while.

The second half though is a high 9/10 The story really picks up and goes off the rails in ways that only a Final Fantasy game can. It creates new mysteries to ponder and consider and really pulls on your heart strings. Wuk Lamat, the central character of the story is a love her or hate her character, and I personally loved her. She can be a bit annoying at times, but never gratingly so and she grows and develops throughout the story, becoming a strong and dependable comrade  who is worthy of standing side by side with the mighty Warrior of Light. The antagonists may be no Emet Selch, but they hold their own in getting you to sympathize with them, save for one (I'm looking at you Zoraal ""I Have Daddy Issues"" Ja).The music is stellar as always with banger themes throughout. Some may hate the jazzy theme of Tuliyolal but I always find myself bopping to it.The combat encounters? Now this is one of the spots where the entire expansion shines. I found myself caught off guard and surprised by trials that were *gasp* actually a challenge with mechanics and telegraphs that were unique and inventive. Even the dungeon bosses proved a challenge at times at minimum ilvl. They killed it here.Visually the expansion is a feast for the eyes. Characters look great and full of life. The environments are lush, bright, colorful, and detailed. The artists really went to town with the game's much vaunted graphical update and now the aging MMO can stand toe to toe with even the most modern MMOs and still look good.Short version: Get this expansion  and keep an open mind, it'll reward you for it with a fantastic story and a satisfying conclusion.",1720285691,0,0,positive

The absence of Natsuko Ishikawa is noticable in the way scenes are represented where it often feels like your character is just there to observe, gameplay wise the MSQ feels very much similar to what we have seen since shadowbringers. Character writing for the main protagonist feels a little lackluster and they feel naive to a fault. That said, the overarching narrative opens up some interesting threads for square to follow up on in the post-release patch content as well as future expansion and I am exited to see where it is headed.[h3] Environment [/h3]The Dawntrail zones look stunning and the graphics engine update does them justice all the same, I really have nothing bad to say about the new zones.[h3] PvE encounters [/h3]The first two extreme trials and expert dungeons of the expansion are tonesetters, SE have said ahead of the expansion that they have heard the critiques of encounters feeling dumbed down as of late and it shows that they have listened.

Loving all these locations too. Wuk Lamat's story is very touching and I feel that the ""boring"" 50% of the MSQ people are talking about was literally the foundation building for this story and is world building, learning about the different peoples and cultures and where Wuk Lamat comes from and who she is. It's also nice for a change that the WOL isn't the absolute centerpiece of an expansion seeing as we had that for the past 10 years. I HIGHLY recommend getting this DLC if you're open to new exciting music, areas and content AND if you're willing to be more on the sideline and learn about a great character who has depth, growth and a solid story.

76561198018403518,0,0,english,"Main story isn't as good as Shadowbringer or Endwalker, but that's to be expected to an extent given the setup that's required with the start of a new story arc. Story-wise, things start slow, then start to amp up about a third of the way through, then by the second story arc of the expansion, the stakes increase and things really get interesting. Overall, story-wise I'd say it's sitting somewhere around the 7.5 - 8/10 range. Keep in mind that your character takes on more of a mentor role in this expansion to the newly introduced Wuk Lamat. This character develops throughout the expansion, from essentially a naive and sheltered child into a confident and capable leader. She is for all intents and purposes the true protagonist of most of this expansion, and if you're not a fan of her, you probably aren't going to enjoy the story this time around.Encounter design (at least for normal content, I haven't done the currently released Extremes yet, and as of this review the raids have not launched yet) is better than it's ever been, dungeons are a bit more challening this time around so they're not too much of a snoozefest.The new jobs are fun. I haven't played much Pictomancer, but Viper is possibly my favorite job to date. If you like a simple rotation that doesn't make you think very much, but one that also feels rewarding to play due to the sheer APM built into its rotation, it's the job for you.The new zones, and visuals in general are gorgeous. The graphics update that released with the expansion makes the world look so much more alive than ever before. That's not to say that it's necessarily up to modern standards, but they manage to still make this game look great despite its age.The soundtrack starts off on the weaker side in my opinion, but once you get into the second arc of the expansion, it's some of the best we've heard. I hated the end credits music though.The launch has also gone incredibly smoothly, especially when compared to the launch of the previous expansion, despite having an even larger playercount this time around.All in all, at this early state in Dawntrail's lifespan, I'd give it a solid 8.5 or 9/10 overall.

It has been a major step up in almost every way.

76561197983097990,85777,103,english,"TL;DR: graphics look great, encounter design is the best it's ever been, but the main story really is that boring.First of all - if you're wondering whether you should play FFXIV and haven't played it yet, the answer is YES. The game's first major story arc across 5 expansions has concluded, and I would say it's one of the best stories in video games and one of my favorite stories in any media with hundreds of excellent dungeons, trials, and raids to play - all of which are still actively run by the game's player base. It's 1000s of hours of high-quality entertainment, and I unreservedly recommend it.Sadly, the game's *second* major story arc is off to a rough start. The problem is not really with any single character or plot beat - the problem is the PACING of the entire expansion. About 20% of the expansion's main storyline involves combat - duties, dungeons, trials, all the rest. These encounters are some of the best I've seen in the game, and are absolutely a blast to play over and over again. Unfortunately, story is the other 80% of the game. You will walk to an area, see a cutscene (or 2, or 3), walk to a different area, see another cutscene (or 2, or 3) and keep doing this. There are entire levels from 90-100 where you don't have to attack a single monster - you get enough XP from the story to do this. Previous expansions have all had very significant story components - this is a game that loves its narration. But in prior expansions, the mix of combat and narrative was better, and the story was far more epic. Dawntrail specifically tries to take a step down with its story and deliver a de-escalation, where you're more of a mentor figure to other NPCs learning how to make their way in the world. And that's cool from a narrative perspective, but makes the game really, really boring to play through for those 30 hours of pure narrative - much of which is characters repeating what you already know or figured out. As an example, there is a very cool moral question the game brings up towards the end of the expansion... but it chooses to do so when you're about to stop the expansion's final boss from doing Really Bad Things. So you literally walk away from the door to the final boss, explore an area with no real combat, and go into 2+ hours of narrative filled with cutscenes doing their best to tug at your emotions. Fair enough, I suppose... but I wanted to go deal with the boss that the game told be was about to do the Really Bad Things, and now I'm delayed from doing that - or anything resembling gameplay - for HOURS. It's not the plot that's the problem, it's the pacing.So, why do I give Dawntrail a thumbs up? Because now that I've finished the main story, everything is fun again. The graphics update makes the world come to life, the music is awesome, the new encounters are top tier for any MMO, new classes are fun (and every classes' new features from 90-100 are fun as well), and there's a ton to see and do. The sidequests don't really suffer from the same problem the main storyline does, and I've enjoyed leveling up my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes way more than my 1st class. Dawntrail does everything you love about FFXIV better than it's ever been done, except the story is the most boring it's ever been.I do recommend Dawntrail, just know what you're getting into.",1720242216,0,0,positive

I won't go into the story too much, but I found it gave an exploration vibe for the first half, and a crisis vibe for the second. It has quite a few tear jerks in that second half, so be warned. The areas we journey through are some of the most vibrant, lush, and interesting areas we have in the game. The new lightning engine really delivers those areas nicely. The two new classes are fun and distinct and present their own class identity. Apart from some balancing issues, picto being absolutely busted at launch, which I'm sure will be remedied, both classes are really fun. Don't listen to a lot of these negative reviews complaining about Wuk Lamat, sooooooo many are complaining because they found out the voice actress is trans. Yes, some are legitimate complains about things they don't like, but the overwhelming majority aren't.Cons-The expert dungeons are absolutely insane compared to what's come before. Some of those are new mechanics and some of the not so great players in the game get absolutely slaughtered in expert dungeons. Even the regular level dungeons are crushing bad players. The difficulty curve is a bit jarring when coming off of endwalker. As mentioned above, picto is absolutely busted, but it's already been addressed they're going to fix it.Verdict: for the price, you're getting an amazing product. Is it perfect? no, no game ever is.

I think if you're able to pick up on all these ideas the writers have laid out you'll have a enjoyable time with a side of adventuring.Gameplay: FFXIV continues to be one of the only mmos with as many variety while being viable in end game content. Just play what you like and you'll be fine. If you like how they played in previously then you'll more or less like them here. Dungeons got a bit of a difficulty upgrade which is nice, the bigger boss fights (trials) are also more exciting and cinematic. The music always FIRE! If you played up til dawntrail (assuming you've played everything before although not required) you should like dawntrail since it's more the same but with minor polishes here and there. The structure and gameplay all remain relatively the same.  As I find that CBU3 found their formula and is sticking to it. And with everything they're planning to add field zones, expanded housing and island sanctuary,  new fights, new limited class, new restoration zone, expanded pvp, more variant dungeons, more deep dungeons and probably forgetting some. I don't think you'll get this much content anywhere else really. So I'm looking forward to everything this expansion has to offer.",1720235654,0,0,positive

After an emotional roller coaster of Shadowbringers & Endwalker you finally can go back to your roots to ADVENTURE, and along the way trouble follows you like it always dose. Truly my only big critique of the expansion is that at times the voice acting was low quality and/or tone felt off, but was happy that cutscene were as a whole more dynamic. <3<3<3<3<3Now a quick rant abt the reception ppl are having. The people saying this expansion was boring or ""wol was inconsequential"" have not paid attention to the story of this or previous expansions. Our objective from the start was to help out this woman become the next leader, we joined her so we could learn about ""the new world"", a foreign land to us that we know nothing about. From the very start we were a guest of one of the heirs to the throne, so it would make sense that SHE was the main focus, and no we were not inconsequential, we just didnt get ALL of the attention because that was never the objective. :)",1720233732,6,0,positive

It's a nice change from being the hero always dashing around saving the world, and instead you get to take it easy and guide a young, inexperienced person on their journey. The music is also wonderful and thematic (in places - there's one place where the music choice threw me off rather than immersed me into the setting) and I enjoyed learning about the culture and the new people in Tural. The new dungeons and trials are also quite challenging, but fun.However...  (spoilers ahead)The writing is definitely subpar in some circumstances. Certain themes are repeated so often and with the subtlety of a brick being thrown in your face to the point that even cutscene skippers are well aware of them. I think many of the complaints of Wuk Lamat being annoying is not because of her personality, but because how every time she gets an opportunity,  she talks about protecting the hopes and dreams of her people. This theme gets forced into conversation at the merest hint of any opportunity.Worse I think is the portrayal of Sphene. It's emphasized again at every opportunity how much she's supposed to be a good person and how much her people love her because she has the same values as Wuk Lamat. It's clear we're supposed to be sympathetic to her, but after the excessive repetition of those themes around Wuk Lamat, having them get repeated yet again in excess for a new character made me immediately hate Sphene. Coupled with how Sphene has no characterization beyond these traits, I reached the end of the plot feeling relief that it was over, rather than saddened by her death.Outside of these two characters and the way the writing is heavy-handed in trying to make us connect to them, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Many of the side characters have good stories, and overall, I'm left a little disappointed, but still mostly satisfied.",1720233548,8,0,positive

A breath of much needed fresh air yet still managing to hit my emotions like a bus.""Skip to the bottom if you just want a TLDRI will first briefly discuss combat. As someone who has completed all five ultimates, I feel the combat in this expansion is wonderful and can provide several new avenues for new ideas. From the first dungeon to the new extremes, things felt fresh and my opinion was very positive on it all.As I had written previously, this story is much needed fresh air as opposed to what we had initially. I feel the formula of ""OH NO! There's a big bad that will end the world and ONLY YOU can stop it!"" would get old incredibly fast. We had this formula for two expansions in a row and I feel if it were the same for this one my interest in the story would die incredibly fast.Why I love this story as much as I do is it tells a story from a whole new perspective. We come to Tural as guests and that is our role. We are only there to help Wuk Lamat win the contest. So in other words, our character serves as more of a mentor role to help new faces grow into strong roles. Some of my friends have argued with me that even at the end of Wuk's story line that she is undeserving and has shown no growth, I feel the opposite of such sentiment but understand it but thats an entire rant in itself. Regardless, having our character take the passenger seat rather than be the driver at least to me felt incredibly needed for this game's story to remain healthy and not tired.As for the later half, my sentiments remain in line with most other people I talk to about this story. It is incredibly good. Without getting into specifics, I had lost several close family members right before this expansion had come out and the story had managed to make me relive my sorrow for each of those losses. I think a good story is always great when it manages to make me feel actual emotion rather than just be a robot shrugging off an entire story as ""eh""TLDR:• The combat is great and not sleep inducing as opposed to previous expansions.• The story is a much needed reprieve from what I was starting to dislike about the Hydealyn trilogy• To me this expansion has a lot to work with as we enter a new saga of stories to tell the players and has me eagerly looking forward to the future of the game I fell in love with.• If people wanna give this more clown awards thank you in advance for the free steam points!",1720222860,5,0,positive

76561198059649039,0,0,english,"TLDR; Better than Stormblood and ARR, worse than Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The negative reviews are entirely invalid. If you don't like Wuk Lamat fine, not a reason to leave a negative review. If you don't like being the MC fine, even though we knew going into this we would be taking a backseat in the story. But if the narrative of  Wuk Lamat and not being the MC is reason enough for you to leave a negative review you are being unfair to these devs. This is on par with the other xpacs, especially if you are aware of the story to any degree. We laid a foundation and had an amazing adventure across a base game and 4 xpacs. That story is done, it has concluded, to tell another story we have to lay a foundation again, and here it is. If your media literacy is this poor then FFXIV was never a game for you. Anyone who has sunk the time needed to finish the story to this point understood what was next for us and this was a good way to do it imo. I expect the review score to shift once the playerbase that was waiting to finish the xpac before reviewing leaves their's, as almost all of the negative reviews weren't even half way in when they posted. This and the Elden Ring response has me genuinely upset with the gaming community at the moment. We have AAA games pushing live service, mtx, and god knows what else and they get half this backlash for doing things actually worth calling out. Do better.EDIT; Reading more of the negative reviews to try and give them the benefit of the doubt, the only things I can agree on are the need for a neutral button or more nuance than a thumbs up or thumbs down. That said I'm seeing a lot of reviews that outright lie about parts of the story that they wanted and are claiming aren't there. Or details they wanted from certain characters or responses that they didn't get. But I can more often than not point to a moment in the xpac or multiple that check the boxes they are claiming were left unchecked. A lot of these people started skipping cutscenes and admit to it in their review. I get it, you people wanted this low stakes, vacation after the adventure of a lifetime to somehow be a bigger journey than the base game and 4 xpacs we did before it. Like, you somehow wanted the story to go up in quality from Shadowbringers and Endwalker which is just not possible when we are just starting again. It's not a perfect story, for sure, but to review bomb the dlc cause you didn't like this msq is a bit much considering this is only half the story and we have patches of msq to come as we always do. Wuk Lamat is stuck in Tuliyolal, she's not leaving to join the Scions, she can't hurt you any more. I get if you want to rate this lower than other xpacs cause of how you feel about the msq but every xpac gets some level of complaints from some part of the msq that just bored them to death. If you actually played and read the whole damn story from level 1 to level 100, you are perfectly fine with this one. That said, we need more nuance for reviews. Some people will have one moment of cringe in the msq and discount the entire xpac, some love the whole xpac and have small complaints and still give a negative review. It's honestly been a mess.EDIT 2; First wing of the new raid is out and the content including the story continues to be top tier.",1720213811,3,0,positive
76561198032949453,577747,432,english,"Let's make one thing clear: This expansion was never meant to match Endwalker, let alone Shadowbringers. We closed a massive saga in Endwalker and started to open the way to a new one with Dawntrail. The story wished to emphasize this as our ""Now that we've saved the world... Let's explore some more!"" arc, and it did that in spades. There was more character growth in this expansion than in any prior one, and it was all while our WoL took a backseat to play advisor/mentor and help foster these growths. It's honestly refreshing to not be the center of attention throughout the whole expansion, and I'm sure as the story goes on we'll be brought into the spotlight once more as the lore unfolds. But for now, let's enjoy our vacation arc and the unexpected!!Wuk Lamat is an amazing character, and was portrayed wonderfully by her VA. No one can change my mind on this one. The VAs for all new characters knocked it out of the park.The music is INSANE!!!

76561197992719974,86638,2,english,"Let's get the controversial part out of the way first:I liked Wuk Lamat. She was a well-written character that, admittedly, did take up a lot of the story. She has a massive amount of lines (compared to other characters) but she's fun enough to be with that that's not that big of a problem. For the love of Christ though please play in JP voices, it's better overall and for whatever reason the EN VA for Wuk is petty awful. Honestly, if you're playing JRPGs you should be playing with the JP VAs anyway. I'm personally convinced that most people that hate her only play with English voices.For the rest:The story is pretty good overall. I think it ended somewhat weakly. No spoilers, but it felt like there could be more to it, but I suppose that's what the patches are for.The rest of the story was fun though, it felt like a good journey from beginning to end. It was fun learning about the different cultures and zones of the new area. Going through it with Wuk along the way did add to that as well. It felt like a journey of growth. It was much less impactful than Endwalker but that's by design - in Endwalker it was the cumulation of a decade long storyline, this is something completely new. One thing they could improve on is more variety in quests though, much of it is fetch and go talk to this character. Honestly though, the people that complain about the story and its structure probably should just not play JRPGs. XIV is just that at its core - a JRPG. It just also happens to be an MMO.The new zones are wonderful, with the exception of the very last one. It's great to start with, but it very quickly loses its luster, which is a damn shame. The new cities, especially Solution 9, are pretty good too. Solution 9 alone steals the show, but again, it's missing a few small things that would really take it to the next level. There's no inn there, there's plenty of little things that just aren't there (novelty vendors, etc.) that would really make the city feel more alive and fun. I don't really like comparing XIV to WoW, but this is a good example, in Stormwind (or any other major city) in WoW there are plenty of little vendors that aren't connected to anything major, they don't sell your next set of gear, they just have random garbage, maybe food, toys, whatever. They're there for world building. XIV could learn from this, especially with how big of an RP community XIV has.The jobs (new and changes to old) is a mixed bag. I personally only play 3 jobs (DNC, SGE and GNB) and i'm satisfied with how all 3 of them work in this expac, I think there could have been more added but overall it's not bad. I've heard less good things from other classes, especially summoner, but I can't personally say much about it. Again, I hate comparing to WoW, but having more variety and customization in jobs (e.g. talents) would go a long way to making them more interesting to play. On the other hand, the new gear sets so far look great.The new dungeons are a lot of fun, they did a great job with them. Not a lot to say about them really, but the last 3 (minus the post MSQ ones) were really the best of the expac.I'll probably add more to this as i think of it (and when the raids come), but for the most part this is a solid expac.

Do not go into this expecting a continuation of Endwalker, that is not what this is. This is a geopolitical world building focused story like ARR (though much better told than ARR overall). If you have an open mind for cultures, love fantasy world building, or just like political plotlines with some fun characters then you'll like this one. If you don't care about that and just want a simple, fast paced story with lots of epic fights... this is not for you. New Character writing starts simple but grows over the duration of the game, Wuk Lamat in particular feels kinda grating at first but has multiple major growing arcs as the story progresses. A reveal around level 92 of the story really works to enlighten you on why that is, but by the end it makes sense why she is the main character of this story. (Hint: Social person who cares about the people tends to be a better political leader, shocker.) The king of Tural is easily one of the best new characters ever introduced, with lots of depth and emotion. Voice Acting is excellent for the most part, with some of the weaker voices mostly coming from new voice actors getting into the industry, but you can tell they are really trying their best and their performances definitely improve as the story proceeds on. I expect them to continually improve over time with more practice. And to note, the accents of the Turali people are not an easy thing to replicate, the fact that the accent was as consistent as it was is a sign of some very good voice direction. Respect there.My biggest complaints come to some design decisions with jobs, specifically Viper and Black Mage. Viper is really simple in it's current form, without much variety in it's moveset and a serious lack of custimizability in it's button layouts. (Something they fixed for most other classes by allowing you to split buttons apart that otherwise would share a slot). Black Mage has been made horrible to play at any content below level 90 with mana regen and dot applicaitons being way harder to maintain without some of the higher level abilities.

Really didn't like Wuk Lamat at first but she has grown on me through the story a bit as her character matured, but still shes a bit much.

As for the story, I've read too many complaints about it, but why? Does everyone expect to just arrive to a new place and instantly fight gods? Nope. You basically arrive to a new land and you are a brand new adventurer in that land. Just imagine you are back in ARR, the story will pick up again eventually.Have fun fellow Warriors of Light. o7",1720203600,0,0,positive

So forgive me if it's a bit all jumbled.But I'm going to make an exception this time around just to say that Dawntrail is a fantastic reset to pick up on after our WoL's adventures in the Hydaelyn/Zodiark arc. I understand some slight criticisms in regards to a bit of pacing here or there. Or perhaps a few quests that maybe could've been optimized a bit more in how we complete them (such as talking to the same NPC back to back with nothing in between), but most of the reviews I glanced through just didn't warrant reading.It's no Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but if you were going into this expecting that then you weren't paying attention to the marketing. Comparing the start of a new arc to the culmination/climax/finale of a previous arc just doesn't make sense. There's a lot of world building done that both introduces things that are new and things that build on concepts we're already familiar with (won't spoil). The themes that DT played with were really heavy towards the end, the beginning being this sort of coming of age story that we're in the role of a mentor, and the stakes were definitely raised high. This has set the stage for some crazy things in the future and I'm here for it. I'll play devils advocate for a moment and mention, at least, that I am someone who likes to read in general and doesn't mind it when cutscenes aren't voiced. So perhaps the fact I found it as great as I did is because I don't really get into zoomer mentality/qualities of a lot of modern games where things are thrown out real fast without a lot of build up or are built around microtransactions and/or typical live service schemes.Story points aside, other noteworthy mentions are the fact that the music is amazing (I love a certain blues guitar theme), the combat design for all the new encounters, even in dungeons, is a step up from everything done before. Haven't seen encounter design actually make people pay attention in casual content like this since Stormblood. New jobs are great fun to play. The graphic and lighting overhauls are beautiful. The gear and new dye system are going to take glamour to another level. And the zones are just gorgeous.

Final Fantasy XIV is a game about legacy and memory, how we are remembered, how we remember others, how we tell stories, and Dawntrail is a masterpiece in following that through, because the new world respects its legacy, it respects your legacy, and by its end, it echoes in perfect chorus one of the game's most memorable lines:  ""Remember, that we once lived.""Also, the dungeons are *really* fun.",1720193285,1,0,positive

76561198006414488,0,0,english,"I really enjoyed my time with Dawntrail, and I think it's a worthwhile expansion. It has some of the best fights we've had in years for normal content, and some amazing Extremes, not to mention the new Expert dungeons. There are more mechanics, they happen faster, and healers have to be more on point to deal with incoming damage. Even in normal dungeons the bosses are not boring tank and spank bosses like some in Endwalker were. But while the fights are great, the classes are either unchanged or even more simplified and homogenized. Not to the point where nothing distinguishes a Summoner from a Red Mage anymore, but the Tanking jobs especially just feel like they all work the same now with VERY small differences.The new jobs, on the other hand, are fantastic. Pictomancer is the standout as a tough but satisfying caster, and Viper, while seeming complicated at first, is a satisfying melee DPS with amazing animations and sounds. I have never been a melee DPS guy, but I might start maining Viper for those crisp animations alone.The new zones are the most beautiful we've had in the game, and the graphical update is really putting a lot of work in to make them stand out. Compared to even Shadowbringers' zones this is on a whole different level. They are also a lot easier to navigate and this makes it very fun to just roam around in them doing FATEs or sidequests. And if you're tired of land-based travel: it's much simpler this time around to unlock Aether currents and be able to fly.The music is as good as we've come to expect, with lots of good variety and a few standout tracks for the second and third trials of the expansion. There is your standard heroic fantasy stuff but we also get more rock and folk inspired music, as well as some more techno and lo-fi inspired songs. Compared to Endwalker this new OST feels like a fresh of breath air, or better yet, a return to the more daring soundscape of Shadowbringers.Where it really stumbles is in one of the main draws: the story. It is not bad per se, and the back half is full of exciting and emotional moments. But the first half feels slow, spending a lot of time on building up this new world and its various cultures and places. I think the raising of the stakes that happens halfway through wouldn't be nearly as effective without it, but don't go in thinking you're going to be on the edge of your seat right away as you might've been in Shadowbringers.Characters are the main weak point. Your enjoyment will depend entirely on whether or not you like one of the main characters of the new story, given how central she is to everything. I do not think the overall voice performance of the character is bad, but she falls short in critical moments where an delivery really needs to be emotional, and the fact that she is so central to the story really amplifies this problem.Aside from her there are also multiple moments where well-established characters give...extremely strange performances, to the point where I sometimes wondered if the voice actors were replaced halfway through. I can only assume there are issues in voice direction, as all of these actors have solid track records, and the VAs for new side-characters completely knock it out of the park.Personally, I was also disappointed how two very important characters, Krile and Erenville, really did not get the screentime I felt they deserved. Both have very touching stories that are core to the overall plot, but we never really get a moment where our main character speaks with them one-on-one, or where they get to show how their struggle affects and changes them. On top of this the game insists on constantly bringing back the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who have no story arc and barely do anything, except for moments where they are *suddenly* critical to the story. It really feels like the writers were told to bring them back, since they are fan favorites, but didn't know what to actually do with them.I think this expansion is worth the time and money, if only for all the cool new stuff. The story underdelivers compared to the absolute peak stuff we've had before, but I didn't come away hating it either.",1720191389,0,0,positive

76561198003679003,0,0,english,"[h1](SPOILER FREE)[/h1][h3]Summary:[/h3]Expansion that's thankfully carried by practically everything but the story. If you rate Dawntrail on the basis of Zones, Music, Dungeons/Trials/ETC - It's an phenomenal expansion. With a story? . . . Oh well.  I'd still recommend it but seemingly mismatched intentions, lackluster writing and pushing [i]certain characters[/i] in every crevice will disappoint a lot of MSQ oriented players.[h3]""Find your wings and spread them wide.""[/h3]I'd like to keep it brief as with everything you should experience the Expansion by yourself. This review isn't supposed to steer you towards buying it (or not) but mostly as an recollection and subjective opinion. If you're an active XIV player it's simply impossible to partake in the game without latest expansion so hey - At least you'll know what you're getting into.First six hours is a slog, which mostly consist of you walking, talking to people and exploring the extremely well crafted areas. In fact - You basically encounter minimal fighting before the first dungeon, which is a precedent for the entire MSQ. I daresay that it was as bad as pre-nerfed ARR wine arc which should tell you exactly everything. Instead of sense of adventure and exploring new continent like trailer would like you to imagine It's more akin watching an youtube vlogger visiting those places themselves. Extremely annoying vlogger. [b]And her name is Wuk Lamat[/b]I really, really tried to like Wuk Lamat, throughout my entire experience and I have to say that towards the end she wasn't horrible. Just bad. (Or maybe it's the Stockholm syndrome from spending so much time with her?). Her entire presence is so overwhelming that besides being tedium to you, she actively makes all other characters worse. Really. It feels like writers made her important to the point of others not receiving proper development. Especially after halfway point a lot of those you meet have seemingly really interesting baselines that are sadly not explored or developed. Why? Because Wuk Lamat. A lot of story beats could be way better without her, especially right at the end. I'm not saying that she's the worst character in the expansion (Because certain red head is) but considering that more than 90% of quests include her. . . she'll get tiresome extremely quickly.Nevertheless I liked some bits of the story and ending was nice. It would be nicer without her though! Eh . . . Yeah.Erenville and S. deserved way better.[h3]""No Limits will bind me!""[/h3]Now. Everything else. Zones? Great. Music? Phenomenal. Dungeons and Trial? Phenomenal. Two hub cities are distinct and different from each other and offer something fresh compared to everything we've seen so far. One nitpick I have is that second one is tad too spread out. But sights are great. Both dungeons and Trials aren't too easy and aren't too hard either giving a fair difficulty. If you die it's mostly skill issue, and not the design of the encounter.  Not much I can say without spoiler territory but I can assure you those are the best encounters in entire XIV.Pictomancer and Viper from my limited experience are fun classes. Viper especially so, with given challenge of learning and ""busyness"" (which is getting adjusted, for some reason) and should be easy to pick up. Overall - Everything that's not MSQ Story is great. I'm sure people who don't care about it and skip everything will have swell time - They'll have to skip a lot though lmao. If I'd have to rate entire expansion without Story - Easy 9/10. Great. Amazing. Problem is - You cannot. And I just cannot think of proper score for it overall. What's fair? How you should weight different elements? I leave that, my dear viewer - To you.

76561198017132483,319170,33,english,"These reviews really are wild. Some of them complaining about a format that every MMO, including XIV has followed for years. Go to place. Do quest. Go to place. Do quest. Talk to 37 people and then do a fight. That's what we've always had. If you're expecting a drastic change here, then you will likely be disappointed. As much as Expansions like Shadowbringers and Endwalker are lauded as perfect, they followed the same cycle. But we were several expansions deep into an established story, so all of that talk had already gotten the support of being consequential. This is a new story arc. We're starting from a place adjacent to square one and a new story has to be established. Just like the community will tell you that ARR is a dredge through boredom, but worth it because that story pays off, they'll be saying the same about Dawntrail a few Xpacs down the line. But the key difference is Dawntrail is actually fun to play inbetween all of the slow burn story. and it picks up its own contained excitement in the meantime as well. This is some of the best actual content that we've had in several expansions, with the difficulty curve being turned up a reasonable level to account for our growth as players. The story starts off quaint and picks up heavily about half way through. The biggest downfall that Dawntrail can be said to have, is that it didn't commit to one path, which managed to upset folks in both camps of. ""I want a slow, relaxing expansion"" and ""I want the action to continue ramping up"". Had they picked a path and stuck with it, you'd see many of these reviews disappear. What this expansion brought to the table so far:Fantastic battle content. Beautiful zones, with a soundtrack to match. Lively zones, 5 of the 6 feeling extremely lively even if nobody else is around you. Like a flushed out world, which we haven't had properly since SHB. A new cast of side characters. each with their own backstories that leave plenty of room to dive further into, while still giving enough to get a feel for who they are. Visual updates like crazyAn engaging storyline that picks up over the course of the expansion. It isn't as sudden as some say, It gives plenty of notice before it begins to ramp up if you're paying proper attention. While you get more involved in the action at a fast pace, the action was always brewing around you if that makes sense. Wuk Lamut. A mirror held up to your Warrior of Light showing yourself at the beginning of your journey. She takes center stage as the focus of the expansion, and we become the supporting cast. She is naive, overly optimistic, and extremely quick to the trigger. An adorable character, 10/10 no notes. What DT lacked: A more engaging main enemy. Rather than setting up a larger scale threat to follow course over, we seemed to have gotten fairly ""one and done"" enemies.  While one did carry a good moral grey area, it wasnt enough to be compelling to see there side as we've seen in some past expansions. The final zone needs fixed. It's just not good as is at the end of the story. A clear directional theme. Because it rode that line between two themes, it became a jack of all trades, master of none. ````````````````all in all, I would rate this expansion second place behind shadowbringers, and just ahead of endwalker. It gave character development to old and new characters alike, and set the scene for a pretty grand stage so far. Looking forward to what the patches bring us.",1720180451,64,8,positive

However the story and content ramps up very rapidly and  this is actually now my favorite FF14 expansion.  I was blown away by the second half.  Highly recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW AFTER 15 HOURSI've got 1700+ hours in FF14.  I really really love this game and I was super excited for this expansion.I really want to like Dawntrail.   FF14 is a special game for me.  The world building, story building, engaging story and quests have also held a special place for me in MMOs and RPGs.I had 2 difficult times with this game:-Post ARR quests (I think patch 2.1 to 2.55) : as a new player I joined I think when SB launched, so I played from level 1, through ARR, there were dozens of MSQ quests that gave no XP and that seemed like filler between expansions and these were baaaaaaddd.  I almost quit-This expansion (Dawntrail).   Hours of just cut scenes and fetch quests and talk to NPCs.  I'm like 10+ hours in and I think I had to fight 3 monsters so far.  I keep being told it will pick up in the second half but so far it's been non engaging, non fun, cutscene simulatorEDIT : I'm seriously about to rage quit and ask for a refund.  I didn't pay $50 in order to do beast tribe like daily quests as part of a new MSQ....",1720179027,0,0,positive

76561198133022247,160009,5,english,"Edited for improved readability.For those who want to avoid spoilers, you can rest easy knowing that spoilers have been censored.Right, so, I came into the expansion excited as everyone. They had learned their lessons from the beginning of Endwalker and solved the congestion problems. Well, the first entrants did of course fill up to the brim with thousands of people in the queue, but I got in relatively quickly! And, despite everything... the first part really was a challenge to go through. Not in difficulty, mind you, but in how slow it all was.I get it, we're basically having a soft-reboot and we need to really get into wordlbuilding, but... it's been 40 main quests, and nothing much has happened! Most of what we did was fight the small mobs and have to rely on the omnipresent being known as Wuk Lamat. She's everywhere, even when I sleep now! Each time I close my eyes, I see Wuk Lamat. Just her. To be fair, it is her story for this expansion, so I can understand if we're a bit of a sideshow in this whole situation. But I digress. Her presence in the entire expansion is overwhelming.SPOILERS FOR LVL 95+:After [spoiler]The cooking challenge[/spoiler], which was arguably the most boring part for me. [spoiler]It was literally no fighting, just listening again about how that chad king Gulool Ja Ja united people with food.[/spoiler]. But, after that part, the expansion finally shook things up We would go on to be in [spoiler]The wild west areas of the map, and follow a somewhat mediocre story of a corrupt deputy smuggling riches into Tuliyollal. I do say mediocre, but it was an enjoyable idea, until the town over would completely detonate inside a sphere and give everyone in that one a time skip of 30 years.[/spoiler] So then, after all that is said and done, we were graced by truly some of the most fascinating storytelling I've had in a long time. SPOILERS FOR LVL 97+:[spoiler]Solution Nine[/spoiler] was probably the best city in the game for the longest time! Everything was beautiful, the [spoiler]Neon lighting and futuristic decor[/spoiler] were all incredible. And although many would argue that the setting wouldn't make any sense with the setting of the game, I find that it was a completely welcome but sensible change of pace.SPOILERS FOR LVL 99+:Finally, the part that I found most incredible was the last area.  [spoiler]We would indeed find the city of gold, but it was at times very disturbing. It was practically heaven, people were able to live life and enjoy everything, but they required aether to survive, and that already was in a dire state. It was a truly beautiful sight, with the nostalgic and sorrowful background music. They were all memories of a person given life and conciousness, yet it felt like we were killing them. They were granted an eternal heaven, but it felt bitter pulling the plug on them.[/spoiler]At that point, it became clear that Dawntrail's story was not just the beginning of a new adventure, [spoiler]but it was also a story about letting go. We would say goodbye to those we had only just met, and watching Krile reunite briefly with her mother and father, as well as Erenville getting to spend time with his until we bravely said goodbye, choosing to let go of the past and moving on. [/spoiler] the story truly finished on a perfect high note that I was truly able to enjoy. [spoiler]The  city we left behind after we were done was a husk of what it originally was. All greyed out, lifeless, with only the sky and no lights from any of the buildings to greet us. It was sorrowful and quite the tearjerker. And yet, it was [/spoiler] a truly beautiful ending.As for the other content, like the dungeons, trials, and the future raids, I held myself to a high expectation, and that one was truly innovative. I had A LOT of fun playing this expansion, and the design in these dungeons were utterly beautiful, with the looks and adventures we got to enjoy absolutely brilliant.The story: 7/10 (The buildup was some of the most boring moments I've had, but that truly powerful ending... I feel I can be pleased with what it had achieved and how it was written.)The dungeons and trials: 10/10 (Easily the coolest part about this expansion. Each dungeon was absolutely phenomenal with the boss mechanics, and the trials had some of the coolest boss moves I've ever seen. Truly different and innovative to the very end.)Overall, a respectable 8.5/10. It was an excellent expansion that I managed to thoroughly enjoy.

A good start to the next arc, though some rough edges that will hopefully be smoothed out going forward. A few specifics, with a warning to minor spoilers possible:Story - I personally liked it, but I can see where it has it's challenges. Without Major spoilers, it's very focused on what your character can do to guide another character that's basically new. That's going to present two challenges for story-lovers: Are you comfortable with your character taking a bit of a backseat? Do you gel with the introduction and growth of the new character? If you don't, the story's going to be challenging.I'm happy they're taking risks in telling the story different ways, but they leaned a little too heavily on one character and that can make it hit or miss. I do think some of the reviews are overly harsh, but that's the risk inherent.It also drags a little too long on some items and rushes others. This has happened before, but was particularly noticeable this time.Music: Excellent tracks, some real bangers, particularly later game. Some questionable choice of where certain tracks were used, which is normally something they knock out of the park. Nothing terribly bad, but some ""Could have been better""Combat: 10/10. The Trials and dungeons have been great so far, some of the dungeon mechs have actually made me sweat a little bit. Yes, as we get practice and gear that will fade a bit, but a great start and a good step forward.Zone design: Fan-tastic. Excellent visuals, little details that make things gel so well and really make it feel like a lived in world. At the end of the day, I wanted ARR-but-better and that's about what I got. Dawntrail just missed the mark of Heavensward, and that's no insult as Heavensward is excellent.

76561197961044762,0,0,english,My Dawntrail Impressions and Review - spoilersSo now that I have completely finished the expansion here are my poorly articulated impressions and review of Dawntrail. First I would give it an overall rating of 6/10. Even though I enjoyed it other expansions far outrank it. For me the high points of the FFXIV franchise are the Heavensward and Shadowbringers expansions with SB being my all time favorite.Wuk Lamat as a character did not annoy me as much as it did other people but she is a somewhat one note vanilla character. She is either spewing her guts out from seasickness or she is engaging in touchy feely expositions. Her character progression throughout the expansion is inconsistent. One moment she is completely vulnerable and the next she becomes a super hero. She seems to flip flop between these two states throughout the story. The writing for the character is inconsistent and the writers can’t seem to decide if she wants to be a mewling kitten or something with more substance.Erenville seems to be better written but gets pushed to the back in favor of other characters. The best part of his development is towards the end of the expansion but I can’t help but feel it is too little too late.Bakool Ja Ja is an interesting character but then half way through the story the character loses steam and he is relegated to a minor character. I think this was a missed opportunity. Sphene becoming the protagonist was interesting but she turns into the standard big baddy trope of the expansion. I want someone like the Emet-Selch character who still remains the best villain in the game to date.Zoraal Ja was probably the most interesting character for me and then towards the end he turns into a complete psychopath and is killed off.Unless I completely missed it we still don’t know what happened to Galuf Baldesion.The rest of the characters were just bit players in the saga. We get dragged around a fair bit and do a lot of nodding and shrugging. As a “heroes on vacation” story it probably made sense but IMO it had less impact than the start of FFXIV 2.0.As for the rest of Dawntrail the new instances/dungeons/trials were great if not slightly frustrating with the new difficulty but once you learn the patterns and gear up they become easier. The new graphics are good and especially some of the zones in Dawntrail but some zones were very uninspiring. The music is good except for the Dawntrail closing credits music/song which was awful.I like the Pictomancer class. It has big damage numbers and an easy rotation. I have yet to try Viper and will work on that next.,1720162703,2,0,positive
76561198009999749,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is pretty good. I hate the second ex, but the first one is great and the dungeons and trials are better than endwalker so that's a definite plus. On  the story side, it's alright. I would say it's overall average, but only because it's very good in some places and infuriating in others and it does drag a lot, but I don't think any msq was without issues - as you've probably seen from other reviews, you'll either love it or hate it. There's one complaint I don't understand - that we're not the main focus of the story... brother, what rock have you been living under? The endwalker set-up for dawntrail made it very clear Wuk Lamat would be the focus for this story - she's competing in a succession contest and you were expecting you to be the one to take the crown? makes no sense to me. Anyway, the character itself is very well written, evidence to that is how split people are on her character - some hate her, others love her - in today's day and age, it takes balls to write a character like that and not settle for a bland generic character that no one would care one way or the other.TL;DR: It's good! msq has some issues, but which expansion didn't?",1720162531,2,0,positive
76561198198013807,0,0,english,"I do not like Dawntrail.I've played FFXIV as my main game since the very beginning of Stormblood. I LOVE this game, I love the stories, the music, the zones, the encounters, the love and care that they pour into this game. I don't like Dawntrail. I love every other expansion, and it follows YOU, the main character, on your adventure. You're called the Warrior of Light, or other monikers, and the story has had its ups and downs. It's introduced other characters that you get close to and learn, but they ultimately are rotated out as your steady companions follow along with you, and occasionally you might gain a new one.Dawntrail introduces a character that takes the spotlight completely. The world revolves around this character, to the point that you're pigeon-holed into nodding encouragingly from time to time as this character comes to terms with their growth. Do they grow? Of course, it's a Final Fantasy game. Is it a natural growth? Sure. Do I care? Not really. You don't grow together. It isn't like in Heavensward when you're walking alongside Estinien and Ysayle, or Alphinaud. It isn't Lyse who eventually finds her footing in Stormblood, and she was already a divisive character. The Dawntrail main character is someone else who dominates every scene, and you're relegated to chasing after them until halfway through when YOUR story finally begins, and that's when the story picks up.I don't think it's selfish to want to be invested and integral to the story. Some of the best story beats have been without you, I'm well aware, but you are still part of the scene. If they cut the Warrior of Light out of the first half of Dawntrail, nothing would change. And that's why I don't like it.I would still recommend this game.

Some teething issues in the storyline, but overall better than Stormblood, but given being the first chapter in a new story, obviously not as engaging as Shadowbringers or Endwalker. Due to the absence of established compelling storythreads.Spoilerless TLDR;Is the storyline in essence a deconstruction, reconstruction and whole hearted embrace of shonen anime tropes? Yes. And if that doesn't bother you, it's quite fun.Is Dawntrail ""woke"" in a negative sense? No, not unless you view Naruto to be ""woke"" in such a way. Being that both storylines are remarkably similar in topic and themes. Namely trauma and peacemaking.Does the storyline feel rushed at times? Unfortunately, yes. The storyline could have been extended to encompass two or even three expansions. But luckily the moments that feel too quick are only a few and they do not detract overmuch from the storyline.The storyline takes a rather bold and experimental choice of [spoiler]making the Warrior of Light a mentor character, rather than the main character. With Wuk Lamat being mentored to become Tural's equivalent of the Champion of Eorzea. A story beat hammered in by her job being 'Warrior' and her royal title being 'Dawn's Promise.' Signifying WoL's ascension to the role left by Hydaelyn/Venat.[/spoiler][spoiler]Dawn being the rising of the sun, and WoL/Azem having sun as their symbol. And the title Wuk Lamat is pursuing being 'Dawnservant.' The theme of WoL effectively taking on an apprentice is rather obvious in hindsight.[/spoiler]Another rather bold choice in storytelling is [spoiler]the clear two chapter structure of the story. Where the initial mentorship storyline is resolved. With Wuk Lamat's ascension to the throne being the first half and the ""City of Gold"" being the second half.[/spoiler][spoiler]The perhaps boldest choice in terms of storyline and zone design is the fact that you end up destroying the ""City of Gold,"" with it's beauty and serenity. And while I do wish it went differently, perhaps that's the point?[/spoiler]Final bold choice of note is [spoiler]that Wuk Lamat would appear to be an ADHDer, this isn't extremely strongly signalled, beyond the ""genki girl"" stereotype that she embodies. However, few ""blink and you miss it"" comments by Erenville and the fact that she stays her impulsive and hyper-empathetic self to the end. With her character arc being more about accepting that she doesn't need to be perfect and asking for help is the wise choice, rather than her inherent nature changing.[/spoiler]",1720160974,1,0,positive

76561198048161849,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is emblematic of CBU3. The stories and characters are as great as they always are, the dungeons and raids are stellar, the music is in a tier of its own, but the pacing and content that is used to pad the runtime is often mundane and repetitive. Experiencing and learning about the world CBU3 has weaved is always a pleasure, but quest structure has remained unchanged for years now and if FFXVI is any indication, I dont think it's necessarily the aging infrastructure that XIV is built on that's making things like this. For an expansion that's so heavily pushed as being ""an adventure,"" Dawntrail's maps are certainly bigger and prettier, but the way you explore them is the same as every prior expansion, speckled with the occasional fate and hunt train plowing through. GW2 is still undefeated as the most fun MMO to actually explore. I've seen many people take issue with Wuk Lamat. I don't get the hate. From the get-go, she was poised to be the focus of this story. The final Endwalker questline is literally Wuk Lamat showing up and asking you to help her compete in the rite of succession. Wuk Lamat is a fine character. She, alongside the WoL, go and learn all about the peoples who inhabit Yok Tural. I am fine with her being the star of this expansion, but I think we spend too much time with Wuk Lamat. Way, waaay too much time with her. because of the way quests are designed in this game, nearly every single quest opens and closes with you talking to her. Dawntrail might be the most repetitively written MSQ we've seen so far, and the first half of the MSQ is really predictable, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it takes a long time to get to a very obvious conclusion, but it is still satisfying to see the promises go through their respective arcs.Having actually completed the story, I can confirm that while the pacing is all over the place for the first half, once the rite of succession is over, and you get past the mediocre fourth zone, it picks up a lot of momentum, it gets weird, it gets existential, it gets melancholic, it is appropriately ""final fantasy-y."" The last zone might be my favorite in the whole game.",1720156005,1,0,positive
76561198064342927,56837,122,english,"TL;DR It's easy to linger on the negatives, but I truly did enjoy my time in Dawntrail and recommend it. The main character and certain story beats that are presented are not everyone's cup of tea, and those are understandably a major point of contention. This is, however, still Final Fantasy 14 and the start of a new saga and I can't wait to see what this new saga has in store.Recommending something is rarely black and white. I am very much recommending the expansion. It has a pretty good story, its content (MSQ dungeons and trials) are pretty strong. However... there are some issues that lead some people to understandably not like the expansion.The story, in my opinion, was an all around good time. There were slow parts, especially the start. I liked the rite of succession arc because of how it played thematically in the game. I know some people probably couldn't care less but I enjoyed the in-universe sentiment behind them. Meeting new people, exploring different cultures, and even learning how they view honor, labor, and death was fun worldbuilding on a continent we've never been to, especially since we aren't necessarily the main character in this story. However, not everyone likes the idea of us taking a more supportive role rather than a main role, and that is understandable. After Endwalker, I was totally okay with a casual story where we sat back because it felt like something my Warrior of Light and I needed. For all intents and purposes, a major part of this expansion feels like a beach vacation because the first 6-7 levels of the expansion offer a low-stake competition that acts as a palate cleaner for the epic drama saga conclusion that was Endwalker.Yet, Dawntrail is an expansion with two stories that happen sequentially, and the second story is significantly better and offers much higher stakes. The story picks up quick and it picks up hard and this was when I knew Dawntrail was going to be at least better than Stormblood. This part of the story sets up new ideas and offers a glimpse into where the next saga will go. I will say that the final area is magnificent and a masterclass of storytelling and environment. It is inexplicably a beautiful story in an otherwise dower situation.There is, however, a lion in the room that should be talked about. I like the characters in FFXIV. I like Alisaie and the Scions a lot as we've spent so long getting to know them. I understand the want for a new group, but I desperately hope that the new character Wuk Lamat is not the direction this new group will go if we're indeed getting a new one. The main reason I do not like this expansion is because of Wuk Lamat, but not because she's inherently a bad character.Wuk Lamat is as persistent as the aether in the soil. Every quest is seemingly about you talking to her. You have this group that you've gotten to know for so long and the expansion spends so much time trying to separate you from them and pairing you with Wuk Lamat every opportunity. It's infuriating and it's grating. I do not have a problem with Wuk Lamat as a character, in fact I wanted to like her, but it feels like I was being beaten over the head with her character and that made her an annoyance rather than a companion. I wanted more from the Scions. I understand that it's her story, but surely that didn't mean we needed to spend every waking moment with her and completely neglecting the relationships we've built since the beginning.There are some other issues I have, including some massive plot holes in the story. While the expansion spends so much time talking about embracing tradition and other cultures, it is not quick to disavow an objectively abhorrent practice that I can only hope is talked about in a later patch. [spoiler] In Alexandra, souls are stripped of their memories and recycled when a person dies of natural causes to give others who died prematurely another chance at life. Wouldn't this be denying the people who lived a full life and died naturally a proper death? As I've come to know it, when we die our souls and aether are returned to the Lifestream. Our memories are cleansed and preserved and our consciousness remains intact. We live on in all but body. What of the Alexandrians who have their memories stripped and their souls recycled? This should've been something we spoke up about but we remain silent and just kinda say ""oh, well, that's your culture i guess..."" I feel the topic of death as a whole was criminally under-explored and wasted in the story [/spoiler]I look forward to what's next and I hope the complaints of the story and characters reach the right people. This expansion is not a misstep, it is not a step back, and it's certainly not anything to garner concern. It's a more divisive story that really depends on what the person can stomach. It's a step in a new direction and things won't always seem as great as it was in Shadowbringers or Endwalker. These are the growing pains of a brand new saga, but I could not be more excited for the future.This isn't including the two new classes or any extra dungeons or trials or content. I care strongly for the MSQ and its story, it's what's important to me and what I care the most about in an expansion. From what I've heard, though, all of that stuff is really fun so I will be seeking those out to experience them.",1720155946,3,0,positive

I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish, the visuals are breathtaking, the soundtrack is immaculate (as always) and the battle designs were tons of fun. The storytelling does start off a bit slow and dense, but I think that's to be expected in a new world that hasn't been referenced in every expansion until now. The most recent expansions have had the benefit of every expansion prior to build on, but they're starting from scratch here. I won't go into explicit spoiler territory, but in I'll give some summary: Act I [spoiler]was a fun chance to learn a lot about this new world with a fairly well-contained plot. You lean about individual cultures in an adventure that contributes to a larger overall plot that has a satisfactory number of twists towards its end, and while it starts of simpler and more predictable, I thought it was a great way to gently lead into the expansion, especially for how much there is to cover. The end of the Act I story also establishes the stakes for[/spoiler]Act II [spoiler]where things become far more serious and typical of a Final Fantasy story. By the end I was extremely emotionally invested and was crying quite a lot, but I can't really give details beyond that without going into explicit spoiler territory.[/spoiler] Oh and if you're a fan of FFIX, Act II is for you!I think a lot of people's complaints come from the fact that the player character isn't the protagonist in the story. Ultimately this is a pure matter of preference, but if you don't like the main character that each Act follows, that  might get in the way.

76561198007170425,0,0,english,"Story 8/10Endwalker set the story quality barrier way too high. Yes, Dawntrail is not as good of a story as Endwalker or Shadowbringers was. Is it bad? Absolutely not. As it was marketed this Expansion is the new Dawn for the game, preparing for the next 10 years. This expansion should be compared to A Realm Reborn (if anything), is it better? Absolutely yes.The story was very well written. The biggest flaw of it was by far the pacing, but that can be solved by skipping some of the slower parts  if you are not too interested in it. Characters are very enjoyable, have a good development arc, just as you would expect from any FF (imo its leauges better than FF16). The story expands on the lore very well, takes you to very interesting locations, sets up stuff for the future. It does what it needed to do.Combat encounters 10/10I think the encounter design has drastically improved, I have subbed since stormblood but this is by far the best max level dungeon and trial experience I had. Fights keep on your toes, they deal adeqaute damage, punish your for mistakes but rewards you for good execution. So far the starting part, was always overly easy, on many fights straight up boring. There might be some recency bias here, but I think they jsut objectively improved on it (as they said they would), like with the indicators and variety and frequency of the mechanics, it looks very promising for the rest of expansion.Job design 7/10So far for me this is the weakest, but still not bad at all. Jobs barely changed since SHB as far as I can tell, more streamlining everyone is getting a follow up skill, no major gameplay changes aside from like Astro and maybe a few others. It a solid state, probably easy to balance (althought so far pictomancer seems bonkers strong) They said starting from 7.1 they make improvements to give the jobs back their identity and 8.0 might do the big overhaul we need.Graphics 11/10This is great, this has been the main focus, and they delivered hard. The environments look stunning, they updated everything retroactively. Textures and vegetation are very pleasing to look at, character models are great. Older gear was not updated yet, but it is in the pipeline.Post launch content ?/10So far we don't know yet, but what was announced it is already more and looks better than EW and SHB combined.Exploration zone, deep dungeon, criterion, cosmic exploration and ofc the usual raids and ultimates, just to name a few.Overall I think it is a solid expansion to soft reboot the story (since EW finished it completely), the problem that people have that they comapre the story to EW, but that is just an impossible task. EW was an accumulation of 10 years of writing and climax of it all. This is a brand new adventure with clean slate, that will only get (hopefully) better.",1720154033,2,0,positive

76561198174777639,0,0,english,"I had a stellar time of this expansion, and was blindsided by how many people seem to so actively dislike it. People seem to be claiming several things that are just inherently untrue, or are exaggerated to an extreme degree. There will be spoilers in this review. To start, we'll address the cat in the room, Wuk Lamat. Unironically, I think she's one of the better written characters in the game. People talking about her falling over with tears in her eyes are referring to one singular cutscene still very early in the game. She complains about modes of transportation a few times, again only in the early game, but people seem to lack the media literacy to notice that those traits start to vanish pretty early on. To add to this, Wuk Lamat isn't just treated as a leader for no reason, and characters, including her own father say that as of the start of the Rite, she wouldn't be worthy of the throne, and that she needs to learn it over the course of the travels around the continent. And she does just that. Each civilization who lives in her homeland, she meets, converses with, and comes to understand. That is her greatest trait, is her want and capacity for understanding. She meets people on their own level, wanting to know their customs, traditions, way of life and hardships, so she can better help them. This is the main trait that goes against the claims of her being a Lyse 2.0, as Lyse just barged into places and demanded the people there come around to her way of thinking. She's not afraid to knock skulls, but will definitely try to convince you not to beforehand. Next is the claim that the Warrior of Light doesn't matter in the story. This is simply untrue, as you do plenty to help Wuk Lamat come to her way of thinking, and take several sections of the story by the helm. The WoL is over here for support, guidance, and helping her. So it'd spit in the face of that notion if the Warrior of Light just solos everything with godslaying might to slap someone onto the throne. THAT would give some validation to the claim that some people have of it being a ""White savior"" story. But in the same breath they complain about Wuk Lamat running things, ignoring that she's a local entirely. But besides that, the WoL doesn't NEED to be the main character in the spotlight all the time.People seem to have forgotten that before Shadowbringers and Endwalker, Heavensward and Stormblood had pretty little focus on the Warrior of Light themselves. Alphinaud was absolutely the main character through most of HW, and Lyse acted as such for SB. Pretending this is a wholly new thing that's terrible is showing blindness to where the story has come from, and where it can go. It's absurdly limiting to the narrative of the game if every expansion just needs to focus on the Warrior of Light going around running things and punching gods. I'm ultimately not going to talk as much about the content itself, nor the music, as everyone, even detractors to the expansion, seem to agree it's some of the best it's ever been. The MSQ has it's fair share of moments it could have tossed a bit more gameplay at us, certainly, as it did feel that by the time you unlock the first dungeon, you'd only had maybe two or so mandatory mob battles. Considering some of the reworks, this did lead to a lot of people in the first dungeon not having a full grasp of how their kits worked by then. In the end, this is now tied for my second favorite expansion in the game, tied with Shadowbringers for it's wonderful character writing, with special shoutouts to Wuk Lamat, Koana, and the final boss character. It doesn't quite live up to Endwalker, but that was a culmination of the entire story to this point. It wasn't attempting to usurp that finality at this point, though the final zone DID give Ultima Thule a run for it's money. I give this expansion a 9/10.",1720153199,1,0,positive

If you dislike the character, you will probably not like this expansion because unlike previous ones, you are more of a supporting character in another's story. Story itself can be split in two halves. First half I say is 9/10, while second half is 6/10. Wish the antagonists had a lot more fleshing out, felt more like they were tacked on. Story pacing seemed fine, with only 1 zone that dragged it down for me.Combat: 9/10Dungeon design is peak this expansion. Very difficult mechanics that felt engaging and requires some skill and thought. Not EVERY boss fight is great, with one dungeon feeling like it could have been introduced in Stormblood or Shadowbringers in terms of difficulty. Trial fights are really good this expansion. Second and final trials of the normal version are really engaging and well designed, while the first trial is more on the basic side. Tried the extreme versions of the first and second trial and I can say they are REALLY fun, and now I'm looking forward to the raid series.Visuals: 8.5/10I like the overall design of the zones, characters, equipment, etc. Graphical overhaul has added a lot of textures to the game, though it can be subtle if you don't know what you're looking for. Would note that you shouldn't compare this to other games with hyper realistic graphics though.Sound design: 9/10Music is perfect score for me, I don't think I have a single negative to say about the music. Sound gets a ding due to ambient noises can get very distracting in certain cutscenes if your levels are off.Overall rating: 8.5I liked the overall expansion as a whole. I will say MSQ might not be everyone, where the highs will be very high and the lows will be extremely low depending on your preferences.",1720142032,3,0,positive

It ruins the vibe.)A lot of people are pointing towards the focus on Wuk Lamat as the main pain point, but honestly I enjoyed her. I do wish we got away from her a little more and got to do a bit of our own personal exploration, but I had a great time having our character be a little sidelined to take on a mentor role. As it is said in the trailer, our character did seem to be enjoying theirself for a change. The main issues I had came from a somewhat repetitive end half (although still interesting), with it feeling more like what we already experienced in past expansions with a new coat of paint. It was a safe choice for a bridging expansion, but I wish they decided to do something a little more ambitious. There was also a TON of filler that should have been cut. Without going into major spoilers, a prime example of that is a certain door I was EXTREMELY excited for was instead brushed aside for us to go fuck off in yeehaw land, leaving me somewhat dissapointed and just begging to get through that section so I can see the thing that we brushed over.

This will be a full review of the expansion regarding the content featured within the main story as of patch 7.0 and will be discussing the good parts, the bad ones and my general feeling with Dawntrail.So without further ado, Let's get started..After Endwalker has been finished and fully concluded by the final post MSQ quests of that expansion. it did also mean that the original arc of Hydaelyn-Zodiark that has begun with 1.0, came to an end fully by patch 6.5 with the final fight against Zeromus.For those are interested to know what happened to the Garleans after Endwalker, I strongly suggest doing the Master Role Quests to get more of an idea of how the way of life went out for them.But back to the topic. as a result, Dawntrail will be starting a new story arc within the FFXIV lifetime and therefore expected to feature lower stakes and have a much longer introduction than the usual parts.The expansion starts from where post Endwalker has ended, our Warrior of Light, the Scions and Wuk Lamat who did visit Eorzea, Old Sharlayan to try and gather our support will be sailing off to Tural and our purpose is to help Wuk Lamat to become the new Dawnservent. Despite what most people believe, the WoL does play an important role within the story as you will be supporting the said character during the journey.So the good? First, the music being used for Dawntrail's trials and dungeons is outright hitting hard and I would argue that the music for the [spoiler] Vanguard [/spoiler] dungeon makes A Long Fall to feel slow in comparison. safe to say that Soken doesn't disappoint with his art!Second, Seems like that Yoshida has listened to community feedback regarding the normal content and has decided to spice things up by making all of the dungeons and trials far more engaging in terms of mechanics and also fight encounters with boss fights to the point that an actual effort is needed to get through them which is a really welcome change after Endwalker's mindlessly easy normal content that was criticized by the majority of the communityThird, the graphical update is simply gorgeous and finally brings FFXIV to the modern era of visual fidelity with much better lighting, higher quality textures and for the first time in history. more AA options other than FXAA which isn't really an AA but rather a simple post processing effect. the update also brought support for DLSS and FSR (for improved results for those who suffer from a blurry image or so, use FSR at the 99% 3D resolution scale). Not to mention that the graphical update helps to enhance the immersion of the new zonesFourth and that might be a controversial opinion but the story itself is solid and does make a whole lot of sense once you attempt to understand it and get yourself into the shoes of your own character and think. We will talk about the weak points of the story during the review but it does get a whole lot better and will serve as a good starting point for future FFXIV expansions. the story does have high stakes to it but that becomes noticeable only in the second part of the Dawntrail MSQ (which is Level 96-100)Where Dawntrail has missed the mark and why? a common saying in the community that Dawntrail has a similar vibe to the one of Stormblood where pacing was an issue and the introduction of new stuff into the story was painfully long to the point it does hurt immersion. Wuk Lamat as a great example of that.Wuk Lamat by herself is a lovely character that feels good to attach to and understand her but the game tries it's best to make you sick of her constant presence with a very bad execution due to the questing and overload you with very long cutscenes each time (Speak with Wuk Lamat -> Speak with Wuk Lamat again -> Speak with Wuk Lamat yet again) Having context is extremely important but at the same time. having too much of it does exhaust the player and makes them bored and frustrated.So what are my thoughts on the expansion and would I recommend it? The answer is definitely yes and its quite obvious to any active FFXIV player but overall, Despite the very big flaws in story telling. I would give Dawntrail about 8/10 as despite the rocky start of the story.. it does improve by a large margin and actually becomes more interesting. I would also really respect YoshiP's decision to give normal content some actual challenge which does increase replay value with it and might serve as a ""bridge"" in the long-term towards high end contentHope you did enjoy the read and those who are starting their Dawntrail journey, I wish you the best of luck and have fun!

76561198447484320,131107,7041,english,"Dawntrail is the most ""mixed-bag"" expansion since Stormblood, though it is definitely better than base Stormblood(excluding patches in fairness). The primary issue as is apparent almost immediately, is that the majority of it is built upon the shoulders of a single character(another similarity to Stormblood), Wuk Lamat. This in it of itself is flawed, because an individuals opinion of this one character will then affect how they experience the whole of the expansion. Personally, I came into Dawntrail a Wuk Lamat enjoyer, and was glad to go around Tuliyolal exploring it with her as a tour guide, and then help her with the succession competition, going everywhere with Wuk Lamat, and watching Wuk Lamat grow and experience a character arc. A character arc that mostly concludes at the halfway point, at this point I was *very* tired of watching Wuk do things. I understand it was meant to be a mentorship, and I did enjoy watching her grow. But she has twice as much dialogue as all of the Scions combined. This is too much. Krile is very important to this story, but is sidelined to let Wuk talk most of the time. Erenville is incredibly important to the second half of the story, [spoiler] but even his own mother ignores him in favor of Wuk [/spoiler]. The second half of the story really gets the ball rolling however, ending strong, despite the continued feeling that every character is pointed at Wuk. As it does get to be more of a shared story. Overall I'd advise more pacing while playing through the story if you typically plow through like I do, it's not nearly as bad as people are saying, though again, it relies too heavily on Wuk Lamat. You can definitely have fun during the first half, and the second gets really good. The dungeons are a fair bit harder than previously, but are ten times as fun. The mechanics in them have really started to get more experimental and active. The trials have seen less improvement, but that is more in part due to the fact that trial gameplay has always been better than dungeons, so less room to improve. Overall the instances are MUCH better than previouslyWe are seeing that the questing gameplay could use some work. It's less that it's gotten worse, and more so that it hasn't gotten better enough. It's time that the questing went past a few instances and walking around interacting with stuff. It'd be nice to see more minigames and stuff to spruce things up. There's an inspect mechanic in this, but it would be great to see some actual puzzle there, like connecting the pieces to the environment, or speculating what happened to cause the changes you're viewing. Could see some chocobo racing type mechanics for running away from stuff or something. Could do an ace attorney style press and present system for interrogation, overall things could really do with spice at this point.The presentation and graphical updates are doing wonders, these are some of the best environments we've gotten in FFXIV history and the ambient music in these areas is phenomenal. The people who inhabit these lands are also diverse and interesting, though there's an odd lack of voice acting in comparison to previous expacs. Overall the presentation is generally amazing.Overall Dawntrail is a step up in some regards, and a step down in others. It's not a tumble like some are saying, but it would be good to examine it's shortfalls (especially in regards to zooming out the story a it), and improve going into the patches.",1720137968,1,0,positive

We weren't the main character, we were helping. There was some pretty good character development. It ended a note where I'm curious to see where it goes. It felt fresh and new. The Scions weren't a crutch. I cried at several points. Now, the music. I have been listening to nothing but it this whole time. I haven't muted the music to play my own. Soken spoiled us and I believe he is a god among musicians. Last: Battle contentI haven't had a major interest in doing content in this game for a couple years cause it felt just, frankly, stale. After the first dungeon I sat and had an ""OH"" moment. I felt excited again. I couldn't wait to see what else happened. I haven't done extremes yet, but every single other dungeon and trial had me sitting up and my attention. There's a few moments the VA falls a tad flat, but it's very VERY tiny moments and isn't something major. But I'd give it a 8/10, and can't wait for more!",1720137784,3,0,positive

Wuk Lamat being the most centric character shows incredible exploration and changes over time.The two new classes play very fluidly, they're extra enjoyable.The changes in graphics are positive, and they show off as much as possible. The amount of zooms on your character is proof of that hahahaNew areas are incredibly interesting, full of things to watch and explore, and if you enjoy tidbits of story hidden behind doors, this is also a wonderful expansion for it. Everything is novelty.The dungeons and bosses are significantly harder than other expansions. Not to the point of being unplayable as new players, but it does feel as if the game understands that at this point, you should know what to do.CONS:As wonderful as the story can be, some places feel a bit stretched out. Especially the parts between levels 95 and 97 (not the dungeons), were a bit... Hard. Multiple old classes feel a bit left in the dust, just getting a continuation button as new identity and calling it a day.If you do not like Wuk Lamat, this expansion will feel extremely insufferable.Story bits The story can easily be divided in two parts. The WOL goes on a holiday and becomes a bit of a side character. The pretense is Wuk Lamat requesting our support for her coronation, and in turn, we become her personal Merlin, guiding and showing her off how to properly understand her kingdom and people.The second part is... Quite wild. Cannot really explain without spoilers. For Main scenario enjoyers, it is a delight. Grabs bits of lore and content you already knew, develops them into something new. SPOILER AREA. FULL MSQ SPOILERS![spoiler] While knowing some characters for very little time, some such as Gulool Ja Ja have a great impression. All four of the participants in the rite of succession have very interesting evolution, although Zareel Ja has that take very deep inside the story, maybe a bit too late. He does feel irredeemable as a villain... And that is okay. Not every enemy has to be someone we cry for while beating them. [/spoiler][spoiler] ... THAT SAID. Sphene's end was devastating, as she was someone whom all the time we just wanted to have switch sides, but it was completely impossible. She was, ultimately, a complete villain, ready to commit mass murders left and right, even if it was for the sake of her people, but in a similar way as Emet, she causes complicated emotions. Without going into the realm of phylosophy and opinions, she was a wonderful character, and her relationship with Wuk Lamat was something that definitely carried a lot of weight during the entire second half and end of the story. [/spoiler]Overall? 9/10. Some things never change, there's always some sections that feel forced, slow or uninteresting even, but the expansion promised a different experience, and delivered on it. It was not an epic like Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but it also just, does not try to be. It's its own story.

The player character, as always, is a silent, stoic companion to people who actually make decisions and do the talking - again, standard for the game.The themes explored are pretty interesting - unity amongst different cultures, preservation of peace, pragmatism x idealism. All ideas that were already previously used in the game, but that were approached competently. The greatest positive the story has is that it is very cohesive. The objectives are neatly laid from the beginning and the story advances logically (this is something the game has struggled with in the past).

Yshtola sounded like she was in a large glass case with no padding for sound vibration, and the mic was miles away from her during recording and Wuk Lamat sounded stiff and uncomfortable with some lines.

Ignoring the MSQ entirely the Dungeons and the trials are a welcome breath of fresh air and I was genuinely surprised by the mechanics of some of them as they had things I would expect to see in a Savage or Unreal and are the best in the game currently, makes me wonder what actual savage content will be like down the line, and of course the music slaps as always, thank you Soken.

The second half picks up a lot more and is similar to what we've seen in the last few expansions (more enjoyable than Stormblood). I really don't understand the hate considering we were promised a lower-stakes story compared to Endwalker. I hear that the poor direction of the English dub may have something to do with the negativity, but I played through with JP so I can't comment. Aside from the story, the new areas are the best we've seen so far from a graphical standpoint. I really think the graphics update made a huge improvement in how the game looks, even in older areas. The music is very good as usual, Soken does a great job every time. The biggest improvement I see to the gameplay comes with the dungeon and trial mechanics. The mechanics are so much more fun (and difficult) compared to any normal difficulty duty in the game. In terms of class/job changes, they are quite minimal overall with a couple of exceptions. I wish that we got to see a change-up in playstyle compared to Endwalker, but it seems we'll have to wait for 8.0.",1720120621,5,0,positive

The dungeons are fantastic, a much needed adjust in mechanics has been made. I still hate the Aether Current system, but oh well, I had all the currents by the time I finished the MSQ anyway.

I genuinely thought this DLC was going to be very middle-of-the-road jaunt into the West. Maybe my lowered expectations had something to do with it, but I was genuinely surprised with how good this was! Some points from me:- I expected generic pacific islander music to match the themes, and instead I got some big bops from Soken, especially in the latter half! Hooboy all the Zone/Dungeon/Trial music has been absolutely incredible! Soken Blessed us once again!- The new zones are super fun to explore and travel in, full of rich lore and history of the people there, and while the zones were pleasant to the eye, I didn't expect the variety of zones we got in the latter half of the game - it was honestly pleasant to have my expectations to be subverted in such an insane way, especially for the last zone!- Combat is still combat, but I'm enjoying my level 100 abilities, and so far all the jobs feel pretty much like EW, but with some changes. Most are good, some are okay. But nothing bad that I've noticed yet, will probably change my mind once I get them all to 100.- Graphical update has been a GODSENT my eyes are blessed with such good visuals! Character models/textures look amazing, and I love it! Some bugs are still in the game, like Miqo'te hair clipping with headpieces, but I'm sure devs will fix by now.- Story started off a little bit predictable, and I honestly didn't know how I'd feel about all the new characters we meet. I was personally interested more in seeing Krile's & Erenville's side of the story more, but I found myself rooting for Wuk Lamat as she got less brash and more self-aware of the world around her. Her arc might have been predictable, but I enjoyed traveling with her nevertheless, and overall I think she's fine as a character. And then the 2nd half of the game hits and HOOOOOLY I LOVED THE 2ND HALF TO BITS ALL THE WAY DOWN ♥ BEST PART OF THE GAME!- I've seen some angry comments about the WoL babysitting Wuk Lamat, but I feel its a bit of an over-reaction. FFXIV is a very character-focused and character-driven game where you travel with various companions from all walks of life and their own lived experiences and personalities, while the WoL just [i] Smiles and Nods [/i] at everything while slaying insurmountable foes. Only this time, they introduce Wuk Lamat, a totally inexperienced little kitten trying to roar like a lion and act like she gets it, when she really doesn't. She's okay. Not as good as the other Scions, but becomes more admirable the further you go. Krile and Evenville arc was definitely the best part of character-driven story for this DLC.- This DLC isn't about a world-ending threat, or a looming force over your head that needs to be stopped, like ShB or EW. Its an adventure, a vacation, a summer trip to the Western Islands to see the sights, enjoy the food, and learn more about the big world. With that said, its not without its own foes to defend the realm against, a threat that only the WoL can have any chance of stopping. Its a good mix of adventure and tension with some funny bits in-between.Endwalker DLC ended the final chapter of the Light vs Dark saga for the WoL. Dawntrail is like a start to a new chapter - its fresh step into a new journey and the discovery of the star. Its not Shadowbringers/Endwalker level of epic, but I feel its great as a ""Part 1"" into this new chapter. Looking forward to what the devs do in the future! ♥",1720111821,0,0,positive

Almost all of the areas feel the same, MSQ quests leveled 90-96 are all babysitting Wuk Lamat, a character you have not known for that long and are expected to be invested in the growth of (I'm not, I dont care about her) the quests of which consist of either fetch quests, 4-5 ""stealth"" styled missions where you follow someone and around 5 fights where you fight trash mobs if I had to guestimate. other than those quests you're going to walk from npc to npc doing NOTHING but watching hours of cutscenes. There are more cutscenes than actual gameplay it seems this expansion which can be cool but not this time. I dont care about my 30 minute cutscene of Wuk Lamat being plucky to a fault and be silly. I dont care after a few hours of this, lets move on to something new. not 10 more hours of Wuk Lamat doing nothing.the dungeons themselves are okay, visually pretty. a couple of the armor sets are pretty cool. the final fight was a bit much at one point for the amount of visual effects going on. If you're curious about how they go from the edge of creation story to political affairs, don't worry they regularly go ""i mean the HoL is literally too strong for anything to even matter anymore so we're fine"" as some of their writing. Which is funny they brought it up but from a game perspective or story telling then what's the point. The FF9 references and music is cool, I love that part. But that's about it for anything that really stood out to me this expansion. Some cool clothes, Solution 9 is cool, and ff9 is always welcome. But that's about it. It's like a modernized version of ARR or Stormblood where it doesn't really feel like anything actually matters or there is any danger and is more like a filler season in anime",1720111493,1,0,positive
76561198089324120,0,0,brazilian,"[h1] Review Sem Spoiler [/h1][h2] Direto ao ponto [/h2]Ótima para uma primeira expansão de uma nova saga. E por isso o enredo é, naturalmente, mais lento do que o comum. Bons novos personagens, e bom desenvolvimento de alguns que tiveram pouco destaque anteriormente (Krile e Erenville). As duas novas Jobs são muito divertidas e foram bem recebidas pela comunidade. A trilha sonora continua impecável e maravilhosa, já é uma tradição do FFXIV. E por fim, destaque à ambientação do jogo, que parece ter sido mais bem trabalhada, com os mapas mais ""naturais"". Esse cuidado foi muito possivelmente graças à atualização gráfica do jogo.O destaque excessivo de um personagem prejudicou um pouco no enredo. Muitas missões que envolvem apenas diálogo podem ser massantes dependendo do jogador.[h2] Minhas considerações [/h2]Me assustei ao ver a média de análises como neutras. E apesar de concordar com alguns pontos, não acredito que seja mérito para determinar a expansão como negativa. Dentre os pontos levantados, em especial, é o protagonismo de uma das novas personagens: Wuk Lamat. A personagem tem muito destaque, chegando a ser excessivo, tirando um pouco da fantasia em que a história gira em torno do jogador. Na minha opinião, é benéfico que o jogador perca um pouco de destaque em prol de outros personagens, para que se desenvolvam e tenham alguma ""agência"", ao invés de tratar o jogador como Deus onipotente. Porém, nesta expansão, eu concordo que foi passado do ponto.Outro ponto destacado foi a quantidade de missões que se resumem a conversas. E apesar de ser verdade, não é um ponto que me incomodou em boa parte da trajetória. Imagino que foi necessário para ambientar o jogador em um continente novo onde se é muito destacada a pluralidade de culturas, além de obviamente desenvolver a Wuk Lamat. Conhecer as diferentes raças me trouxe uma experiência positiva com os desfechos.Não é emocionante como Shadowbringers ou Endwalker, mas está [b]muito longe[/b] de ser uma expansão ruim. Dawntrail é uma ótima expansão! É o começo de uma nova saga, sua história tem seus momentos épicos e emotivos, lindos mapas, dungeons e trials e uma trilha sonora sublime!",1720110062,0,0,positive

76561198060509201,0,0,english,"Here are my thoughts on the expansion, spoiler free. I’ll try to be fair, thorough and concise. Started off cautiously neutral, maybe a little optimistic. By the time I got to the end of Act 3 I was pretty positive on the expansion overall. Act 1 and 2 I rank somewhere just above Stormblood, but after Act 3 I’d say it ranks somewhere near or above HW. It’s still far below ShB, but it’s not bad. It’s a decent start to a new storyline with the ending opening the gates to more places to explore. After EW this kind of lower stakes story was both inevitable and necessary. I don’t know if people expected this expansion to live up to Endwalker standards, but that was never going to happen. The two divisive factor for the community seems to be Wuk Lamat herself and WoL playing second fiddle to her, so whether you like the expansion depends entirely if you find her endearing or likeable. I think she’s fine, kind of like Lyse 2.0, hence the comparison to Stormblood. I’ll talk more about her later.Some say that the story is slow, or at least that the first Act is slow. I don’t share that sentiment. At least not when it comes to the first playthrough. I can imagine it feeling slow as hell if you decided to replay it. I’ve played through SB twice and hated the second go of it. I can easily imagine feeling the same way about Act 1 on a second go. My problem with Acts 1 and 2 was different. A problem that forced me to create a way to describe it. I call it the “hacky but plausible writing” factor. There were quite a few events in the story that felt like hacky writing, but were plausible enough to just move on. Some resolutions to problems were a bit too convenient, too easy, too contrived. At least one of them was created by the need to insert a trial. Then it was resolved with no consequences. And that’s an example of the hacky, but plausible factor. If not for that, I would’ve rated Act 1 and 2 higher.The First Act is an archetypal journey of The Fool to see the world. All the classics are here. I considered naming the tropes but realised it would spoil parts of the story. It’s not a bad thing, as far as storytelling goes it’s a solid foundation and a decent choice when considering how it’s now necessary to lower the stakes and start anew after Endwalker. Following up events about the fate of the entire universe is tough and either you have to raise the stakes and go save the Universe 2.0 or you need to find a way to lower them to acceptable levels. After all that, making the WoL now do small errands and participate in Eorzean petty squabbles after all that would be silly, so a setting in a distant land as an assistant to an heir to the throne is a fine idea.What do I think of Wuk Lamat? My initial impression was neutral-positive-ish since we’ve already met in the previous patch content MSQ. Over time she grew on me. She is the Fool in the archetypal journey story. She’s rash, hot-headed, foolish, clumsy, insecure and a bit dumb. All she has is a big heart and willingness to learn. She loves her father, her country and the people of said country. There was only one point where she really annoyed me greatly and it was in the very last trial.The music didn’t let me down. The locations range from okay to amazing. I said I was going to try to be fair, so this is the part where I get harsher:A couple of very obvious flaws, such as the villains not being very fleshed out and Gulool Ja Ja (The Wise Old King) being really grating to listen to in English. I don’t know what that accent is, but to me it sounds like my bad impression of an American when I’m trying to make fun of Americans. Or when Gintoki in Gintama would try to speak English with an American twang. The ridiculous way he talks doesn’t gel at all with the serious things he says. It’s like if you took the Final speech from the Great Dictator and added *honk honk* between every other phrase. I’ve considered switching back to Japanese VAs just because of him.Now, I like the fantasy/role of being the hidden ace, the badass background character in a story, which is what the WoL is in this expansion. But the problem with that is that it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. There are ways to mitigate that and it’s to give the WoL way more opportunities to shine. The occasional acknowledgements like “oh that one’s trouble” and “oh don’t worry, the scary adventurer won’t pull any tricks” don’t really amount to much. I know they’ve tried, they really did. There were many instances of “you’ve already dealt with it?!” but as a substitute for actual heroic deeds it doesn’t work. As part of the previous flaw I found that there was TOO MUCH Wuk Lamat. I say that as someone who likes her as a character. And yet there was way too much, I’m completely all Wuk Lamated out and don’t want to see her at the forefront of any events in the near future. Let her stay as a side character ruler like Lyse or Aymeric, who occasionally pop up to say a thing. Doing two new DPS at the same time was a mistake. It would’ve been much wiser to have 1 tank, 1 healer and 1 dps, so people could level them at the same time and fill all the roles in the queue. As is, it’s incredibly congested and there’s a constant severe lack of tanks and healers (the second partially due to the “healer strike”). Another reason is that even for those that do want to get their tanks and healer to 100 asap, that’s only 4 jobs on each role and 10 levels. There are other reasons, such as fates, but overall the conclusion is clear, releasing two DPS jobs without tanks or healers was a mistake. I’m not super happy about the class changes and additions this time, but I’m not going to rant about that.My conclusion is that I’m positive about the expansion, but in a lukewarm kind of way. I hope it serves as a decent foundation for things to come.",1720108080,2,0,positive

Erenvilles' moms' accent being not the same as his, makes ZERO SENSE to me. Unless, Erenville were not raised by her, which were not mentioned. WHY DO THEY SPEAK IN DIFFERENT ACCENTS? Did her mom changed accent when her boy went across the sea??? What actually happened??? Man, I just don't get it. Looking forward to explanations from those responsible for this decision. I am sure this is one of the creative decision they regret making. 2. I LOVE the ending song. I really do. BUT, the SOLO SINGER? Nah. Nope. I am sorry, but nope. The solo singer ruined the song. That's it. I don't know who she is, but I am sorry, she ruined it. To me this is the ONLY part where FF14 Dawntrail FAILED to deliver. This is the only thing that is not up to the standard and quality Final Fantasy 14. These are my criticism so far. Some creative decision this time around is a little messed up.

It is clearly aimed at world building and highlighting new characters and potential plot points. All the while its an amazing commentary what it means to be a leader. At the same time its a Final Fantasy game so they have players questioning the nature of life and death itself, what it means to die, and when does death actually occur. Its thought provoking while laying the ground work for future expansions.

However, the design of the main scenario quest is showing its age, and there were some parts of the story that had some baffling standing around of your character doing nothing in cutscenes.

While this expansion may not be my absolut favorite story wise it is still solid if you take the time and listen, hear, feel and think about the new cultures introduced in dawntrail and the worldbuilding it does. Dawntrail is what comes after a 10 year arc which ended with you defeating a threat immensely powerful and thus has the problem to introduce new problems for us to solve, which feel not that much like problems but thats if you compare it to a universe ending threat, so it is in a position like ARR was. What i liked about the story too was the Characters representing different aspects of rulers and other characters having the same ideals but in a different way. Gameplay wise the dungeons feel great, the trials are fun and i wonder how the raid series will be.

76561198042054063,0,0,english,"this is a really hard one to talk about because it's a brand new story for FFXIV. we all knew, i think, that it wasnt going to be the same emotional highs and satisfying conclusions of shadowbringers and endwalker, and realistically i think that's completely fine. it shouldn't be! this was going to be a set-up expansion, and set up means slower, smaller scale, less tension. as we're establishing new characters, it also kind of means that the WoL is less important now. this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but... i think they screwed the pooch a little bit on this one. by now, you already know that Wuk Lamat is the main character of Dawntrail, moreso than any other NPC has been the main character of an expac before. yes, even moreso than Lyse in Stormblood. this means everytime the gang splits or has to do something, you're going with Wuk Lamat. and for the first half of the expac, doing this rite of succession, Wuk Lamat can be pretty frustrating. i don't think she has a lot of depth that necessarily influences her character or decisions. they make this big point of going zoraal ja has his strength, koana has his intelligence, what does wuk lamat have? her love of peace? okay, but that's also exactly what koana wants. and not be funny, but wanting everlasting peace isn't something that makes someone a good leader. she isn't exactly a coward, so there isn't an arch of her overcoming fears, she has these little quirks like getting sea sick or liking tacos that don't really substitute for a personality. she is, however, nice! and reckless, and likes to get to know people! so it's not that there's nothing, but if you dont find her quirks endearing (i didnt, looks like a lot of people didnt) then you probably aren't going to particularly like her! one of the main themes around dawntrail is this idea of cultural unity, which makes esne, as well as understanding and respecting tradition. i was worrying throughout that they were going to tell me that wuk lamat would make a better leader over koana because of her respecting traditions, over koana wanting technological influence. if that HAD been the case, then dawntrail would have sucked! because that would've been, ironically, a really conservative message! thankfully i do think it treads the line correctly by oberserving the culture of these myriad groups while allowing koana to rule alongside to usher in a new age of progress. i will say, for as much as i found wuk lamat quite frustrating, i did engage with this story, and there is merit to that. it would've helped had we had any significant interractions with the scions at this time, but we're ALWAYS going with wuk lamat. i hardly noticed krile, alphinaud, or alisae at all in the first half of the expansion. after the succession ends, we get to do cowboy hijinks with with erenville which is fun. then the tension starts! dawntrail is very much a two-halfs kind of expansion, and the second half felt like i was playing FF14 again. heritage found, solution nine, and living memories are much more what we expect of this game at this point. there's still some cheesey stuff that doesnt' really make sense, but it works mostly. galool ja overhearing that we want to kill his dad, running away, and then saying, ""actually I want to get to know you"" was all very easy, wasn't it? you introduce a character like otis and i'm like ""this motherfucker gonna die"", same with galool jaja. the cliche of older dad figure who is a warrior HAVING to die is so frustrating. i wish this game didn't lean into cliches as often as it does with character beats, but its fine. galool jaja clears. bakool jaja also clears. discussed with my fiance a lot about how the last three expansions have all had their final areas be some kind of simulation of a memory, as it pertains to grief and death. and while i hope 8.0 abandons this theme for its final area, living memory still worked for me. i respect CBU3 for having the balls to go ""we made this absolutely beautiful, lovely area with gondolas and rides and ice cream... and you have to permanently delete it"". that really rings through the theme of what you're doing knowing you can't* undo it. i particularly enjoyed the stuff with erenville's mother here. and because graha and alisae were actually saying and doing stuff, i didn't mind wuk lamat anywhere nearly as much! her jumping in at the last minute of the final trial to main character the final boss DID annoy me though, like, c'mon, it's the final boss! uhh gameplay. the instances in dawntrail suck! honestly shocked at this. THREE of them are fighting a two-headed mamool ja, and thats the same one in two of them! the fourth instance is a really annoying ad focused one in solution nine where the tank doesn't group them together so it doesnt have the same cohesion as dungeon combat, so just feels worse? the boss of that  instance summons ads, then the second boss summons too many ads that you're forced into not being able to beat them all. learned helplessness can be cool but when it's just some random creature it just kind of sucks. boring! the dungeons are fine? the only one that really stands out is alexandria, but even then it's not the best or anything. i like the trials! i think it's very cool that zarool ja joins you as a party member for valigarmanda, but then IS the second trial! that's cool! i will say it annoyed me to no fuckign end that you can have NPCs for Valigarmanda and zarool ja, but NOT for queen eternal? i get we use the Azem Crystal but like, you can just make NPCs be wearing the job gear so they feel like generic heroes... like as a someone did this expac as DPS, being able to do all the content instantly, then having to wait over THIRTY MINUTES to get in to the final trial because you decided for some arbitrary reason you can't have NPCs for the final fight is absolutely bonkers. especially in an expac where you released two new DPS characters, so DPS queues are going to be horrific at launch! i just... cannot fathom this decision at all. ""we want to make the game more approachable for solo players... except on this one trial, fuck you idiot"". i think it's also time the MSQ design got a rework. the first half of the expac having us talk to random NPCs to gather information, pick up objects, slay random enemies, i don't know, the formula is running pretty thin here isn't it? surely there's a better way to get us to explore areas without all the meandering involved. especially with the amount of big voiced cutscenes that make these things take a lot longer. i actually skipped cutscenes for the first time in the MSQ. the pelupelu bartering bit was some of the most dire, soul-shatteringly boring gameplay this game has had since ARR i think. sorry, sue me!!looking forward to the post game. the two optional dungeons both went VERY hard, easily the best dungeons of the expac. significantly harder casual content this time around which is VERY exciting for the upcoming normal raid and alliance raid series. i'm looking forward to whatever comes next for FF14, i just hope that whatever new characters we get don't get superglued to us again",1720083864,0,0,positive

Taking your time going through it instead of rushing through is the bread and butter here. If you go into Dawntrail expecting it to be like Shadowbringers or Endwalker you'll be disappointed.

Everything else is a banger so far as I haven't leveled every job/class to 100. A lot of people complaining about the game being to ""shonen"" or even ""woke"" sound like the people getting outraged in 2020 finding out their favorite band RAtM is socialist/communist after listening to them for 10 years. What's worse is some legitimate concerns are getting drowned out due to this such as Jobs feeling to familiar still (which I don't agree with but can see) or end game is to focused on the two minute window (I can see this especially if I still did progression content.)EDIT: I will add, if you truly finished the 7.0 story you would know it's relation to one of the best FF's, but I can't say more without spoiling it. LOL. It's been killing me that I can't talk about it without spoiling it.EDIT EDIT: After being able to reflect on it and run it on my alt, there are some moments that are very ""eh?"" Possibly 3 moments. 4 if you include music from one scene (IYKYK) which isn't the music is bad but simply doesn't fit the theme the xpac is going. A major critique is pacing and I will agree with that. Out of 100 MSQ quests, it is roughly 50/40/10, and if it stayed 100 it should of been closer to 35/50/15. The second ""eh"" moment is a 4/10 moment for me. It didn't ruin the xpac, but it was a low point. Mike from Preach Gaming called it a GoT S8 moment for him and I can see that. It definitely does not drag the xpac to not recommended but once you hit it, you understand a bit of the frustration from the community. For me a not recommended is a 5/10 game or lower and Dawntrail is way better than that. Without the story the xpac is amazing. The story has 10/10 moments but there are definitely some 4-6/10 moments there with that last ""eh?"" moment just making me sigh.

Shadowbringers and Endwalker both featured some of the best storytelling the franchise has ever seen, but were often emotionally draining, and I'm not sure I was ready for more of that. Thankfully, Dawntrail is all about reinventing what Final Fantasy XIV is, and should be, on a conceptual and narrative level while retaining the core mechanics and design the series is known for, and the audio/visual style of Dawntrail seems to have much more in common with games such as FFX and the Chrono Series, which for me was rather appealing. Most of the job changes are welcome, and in Dragoon's case sorely needed, and Square did a great job of letting us increase the power and utility of our jobs without overloading them with a bunch of new skills; instead, most new abilities are simply modifications or enhancements to existing ones, the result of which is that it's not more fun than ever to do high level content that allows and requires us to have full access to our skill sets.The two new jobs are a lot of fun, and feel like they really slot well with the rest of the The new dual-channel glamour dyes are nice, but as yet have not seen widespread use. Most gear to which you can currently apply multiple dyes are the universal lvl1 cosmetic pieces, like the FFXIV crossover gear; some notable exceptions include the lvl89 job-specific gear you can acquire in Old Sharlayan, but other popular high-level gear such as the Augmented Radiant's sets, or the Credendum tomestone gear were left alone for the time being. They've talked about plans to expand on this feature over time and I really hope they do.It'll be interesting seeing where Square goes with the game from here, given that they supposedly wrapped up the entire Light vs Dark saga.

76561198032229718,746880,2551,english,"Dawntrail is easily one of the more nuanced and well-told stories in the whole of FF14. As a standalone story, it introduces the characters and new portion of the world and builds upon them with delicate care, where new players don't have to feel so lost after missing 10 years of story. This begins the new ark and the next 10 years with a push in the right direction (let's be real, the suffocating amount of FF4 was not promising at the end of Endwalker, and this exeeded my expectations coming off of that plotline). Yes, our Warrior of Light is playing a more ""Mentor"" role in this story; it is not our story, it's Wuk Lamat's. As long as you are willing to sit back and watch a tale unfold and not be the center of attention, then this is a lovingly crafted story of growing as a person, adopted family and being true to yourself under great societal pressure. It is the tale of Stormblood told right with a lead character you cheer for and celebrate alongside them. I genuinely do not remember the last time I related so well to so many characters in the Main Story, and that warrants recognizing and applauding.

The pacing and quality of the story, feels like a mix of Heavensward and Stormblood meshed with a teaspoon of A Realm Reborn. There are parts that pickup quite well and parts that feel quite sluggish, but it definitely gives much interest towards the end. In my instance, I disliked Wuk Lamat when she first appeared and was overall on the fence. As Dawntrail progresses, Wuk Lamat grew on me overtime as did other new characters.

76561197997417898,293410,5845,english,"I loved this expansion.  It starts out with a nice change of pace, as the lyrics to the theme say:So, grab hold of today with all your might, The sun is rising. Savor life without rushing, Every single day.Some of the best ""main series"" dungeon and trial encounter design in the series so far.  Interesting game mechanics.  They stepped up the challenge. Game play 10/10. I don't think I've heard a single complaint about this part of the content.When it comes to the story - I enjoyed it a lot. I think this is what a Beach Episode looks like for the Warrior of Light. She goes on an adventure that is much lower stakes (at least to start) - Dawntrail is how the WoL relaxes. The stakes do change halfway through the expansion, obviously. You aren't driving the action, you are acknowledged as the most powerful person in the room and you are providing support and mentorship to Wuk.Wuk is our constant companion  and she is big orange cat who absolutely loves and wants to see the best in everyone, to a fault. She doesn't start out knowing her own power and is a lot more sheltered - it takes time for her to realize what she is capable of and build her confidence. It's a training arc, in a lot of ways.If you enjoy this kind of character and that kind of arc, say if you are a magical girl anime fan, you might just love this expansion. If you absolutely hate that kind of character, you might just be in this expansion for the gameplay and everything except for the MSQ. Heck, she wins with the power of friendship at times.The second half of the expansion was when it really got good to me. I am emotionally invested in several characters that did not get enough screen time.There were high moments where I cheered. There were moments that I actually cried, there were moments I was frustrated with what happened but overall for story 8/10",1720062288,1,0,positive
76561197995319391,0,0,english,"Here's my thoughts on the MSQ story:This expansion to me, is good. Great, even. I'm biased though, I really wanted to explore Tural and they delivered on that front. However the backend of the story shows a trend that has started on patches 6.5, in the sense that instead of a larger plot and story we see episodic adventure jaunts that connect with the reflections of the source, and said plot tends to be condensed to be fully solved and stand alone.This expansion was supposed to be the thing to prepare us for 10 years and all I can read as a major plot beat is that.This game story thrives on character moments (still present on Dawntrail)  memorable moments (still here) and on going antagonistic forces with arcane plans that slowly peel away. That last one is present still, but rushed to be all neatly done by the end of the base adventure.When it comes to plot, I feel the crew got less ambitious for the next ten years. And it saddens me because even though I enjoyed what I got, it doesn't show the promise to ever get us to the highs and payoffs of a Shadowbringers. Even ARR, the base game story which I like way less than Dawntrail's, had a better set up for the future. Let's hope they fix it on the patch story.Here's my thoughts on everything else:It is modern FF14 refined, with two fantastic new classes that have amazing gameplay and enjoyable stories. The new battle content I experienced was better than average and I'm impressed how beautiful the new update looks.If you are a long time fan, its an easy recommend. Just manage your spectations for the MSQ. If you never got into the ff14 train, this expansion won't change your mind.",1720061785,2,0,positive

Last 1/5 is a 3.I enjoyed my time with wuk lamat, touring Tural and meeting the locals. That part of the MSQ is fun and interesting. It takes a sudden turn for the worst around level 98 in the MSQ and things get ... bad. I enjoy scifi more than fantasy, and all too often people put them together and I don't like it. Really don't like it. And that's what happens at that point. Suddenly scifi, suddenly bad scifi. I won't go into the story but it's rather tropey and the only interesting part of it is krile's backstory. Then there's the city/zone design. The 2nd city is sprawling and empty. Extremely empty. Tulliyollal feels like there are complete parts of a city put together, the 2nd city doesn't have that. And the final zone is even worse. It's like Azys La but with melancholy music and I hate it. And don't get me started on the guide, I hate her character.As for gameplay, the dungeon fights and trials are all pretty great, probably the best FF14 has had. But as a dragoon main, they fucked that shit up. I have gone from 3 jumps in EW to 2 jumps in dawntrail, the rotation is now a spam fest of procs that I try to weave in on ogcds instead of being a coherent rotation that, admittedly was long and had no variation, but was easy to muscle memory. This shit makes me feel like I'm playing dancer for 10 seconds every 30 seconds and then it's back to the regular rotation and I hate it. They gave me this fast move to mob ability and it just feels ... bad ... compared to a jump. Give me my damn class identity back.As for music, it's mixed, some good tracks, some good tracks used in places that doesn't feel right, and some stuff I didn't care for. VA performances are great, Wuk Lamat is a big bundle of energy and I can see that grating on people but she's fun. Everyone else is done well though the VA director might want to do something to reduce the occasional bad plosives.Overall I was enjoying the expansion but for the last 2 days, it really took a nosedive and I can't ignore how they mangled dragoon.",1720060584,0,0,positive

I do believe your enjoyment of the story lives and dies with whether or not you like Wuk Lamat as a character (I, personally, did not mind her, but thats not to say everyone's opinion will be the same). The expansion DOES hit the nail on the head with some really good dungeons, trials, and raids, so the post-MSQ content that you'll likely be sinking a fair bit of time into is still just as good as the post-MSQ content we've gotten from other expansions. Overall, I do believe Dawntrail to be a good expansion, but if you go into it thinking you're getting something on the same level as ShB or EW, then you're likely going to be somewhat disappointed. Its probably better to set your expectations to something more akin to Stormblood. Still good, just not the greatest content we've gotten - and that is okay.",1720056780,3,0,positive
76561198179893841,506613,3820,english,"Dawntrail is an expansion with what I consider to be a good story. Not amazing, not bad...just good. In terms of lore significance I believe it will serve in the new arc like A Realm Reborn and Stormblood did. That is, advancing the plot by introducing plot points and new lore and not through massive revelations like Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Those with even the smallest media literacy know this; worldbuilding is extremely important when you are building up a large story that seeks to build upon said worldbuilding.Those comparing this story with the prior two expansions, at least story wise, are simply being disingenuous or dumb. Yoshi P made it very clear what this expansion was going to be, so much so that it was a meme - 'beach episode expansion.' Despite setting that expectation and it being MORE than that, people still complain that it is filler and boring.This exposes a large issue with Final Fantasy XIV's community. That being, many of them want constant payoff because most players entered the game when the story offered for the ability of such all whilst completely forgetting that the game has been around for more than a decade and had the means to build up to the payoff that Endwalker had bought.I would rant that many of XIV's audience are Shonen-heads that can't compute what actual storytelling is but I ain't gonna get started with that.Besides the story which has been the main point of contention among those that have played it, I think universally the combat content has been loved. I agree with this. The dungeons and trials that were released in the 7.0 patch have been among the greatest ever introduced in the game. The areas too are some of my favourite in the game.My main complaints about this expansion are, like many, Wuk Lamat's voice actor, who struggles with yelling and any tone that isn't 'happy.' As a character I quite enjoy her, but I really do think that she is just a better version of Lyse. That meaning she's kind of forced and unlikeable for some reasons. I completely understand the critiques of her. I get its her story, but man. It really is a lot. As for a real critique of the story, a certain small arc in it could genuinely be filler as it serves nearly no purpose to the wider story.Overall I'll give Dawntrail a 7.5/10. I hope that the 7.X cycle gives more longevity than the 6.X cycle did.Oh yeah and a mandatory note that Soken kicked ass this expansion.",1720056732,1,0,positive

76561198035661426,161186,767,english,"Your mileage with Dawntrail's story will heavily depend on how much you like its main character, Wuk Lamat. She has been described as a ""shounen anime protagonist"" due to how the expansion focuses so heavily on her development. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing; she's well written and her voice actor does an excellent job, and as a story about a warrior-princess learning to be a ruler it succeeds with flying colors. However, players who are more interested in stories that focus on their own Warrior of Light or on other characters they've already grown attached to may have trouble appreciating an expansion written with the goal of presenting something entirely new. I can completely understand the viewpoint of those who got tired of her by the end even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.On the plus side, Dawntrail's scenarios are some of the best the game has ever had. They have complex encounters with novel mechanics and excellent theming, and the soundtrack never fails to get me pumped for combat. I can see myself enjoying these dungeons and trials long after Dawntrail's release. Even if you find that you don't like the plot, you'll get plenty of enjoyment from what the new battles have to offer. The new jobs, Pictomancer and Viper, are fun spins on caster and melee DPS archetypes.Pictomancer uses GCDs (spell casts) to ""paint"" different weapons or effects and then can unleash them when the time is right. They also make use of hotbar buttons that change with each cast on a cycle, rather than having 3 separate actions which is a nice QOL touch. Overall, it has the feeling of playing a slightly more complex Black Mage.Viper, following in the tradition of other melee dps classes, chains together instant skills into combos to do different attacks. Their main draw is that they can use certain abilities to unleash a burst of damage by combining their two swords into one polearm for a couple combos. It ends up playing as something of a ""chase the glowing buttons"" game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but may lead to it feeling underwhelming after the initial novelty.Overall I give Dawntrail a 9/10. It doesn't rank above Shadowbringers or Endwalker for me but I would still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game. My guess is if you've played to level 90, you've been playing long enough to appreciate what Dawntrail brings to the table.",1720049171,26,2,positive

(Mild spoilers)I understand some people might find the first half of it boring, but I really enjoyed knowing a bit more about people and cultures.The idea of the contest and the different trials you have to undergo are interesting and helps to develop all the main characters in this first half.My only objection is that I feel the character of Zoral Ja was not very well-developed, and their motivations were not very clear.The first half was fun; finally, our wol can be more of a secondary character and can rest for a bit, while still participating.Mid-expansion quests, got a bit boring, but not loporrit level of boring. Second half, however....I won't spoil, but damn, I didn't expect that rollercoaster of emotions. It gave us a good background for some of the characters we know from previous expansions, and I think it will help them move forward with a better-crafted personality.Overall, one of my favourite expansion so far, and I'm really hyped to see what will come during the post-msq patches. It opened some interesting opportunities to move forward.The graphical update has been a blessing, and the new mechanics added in trials and dungeons, are quite fun.They haven't been able to fix monk, though...If you have enjoyed the msq so far, and care about characters and story, this expansion is very enjoyable.Lyse did nothing wrong, and Stormblood was not a bad expansion.",1720046003,1,0,positive

We help in meaningful ways but the story is not at all focused on us. Honestly this is a breath of fresh air not having the world riding on our shoulders. This is meant as a vacation, a break, and an adventure.Taking your time with everything should be everyone's perspective going in. Sit at a chair in-game and watch the waves for awhile.

I also want to give a big shoutout to the server engineers this round. I remember how bad login queues were back when Endwalker launched and as someone who plays on Crystal, I am so happy I don't have to wait in 10k queues to play. My advice for someone going into the expansion: Do not expect it to be to the levels of Shadowbringers and Endwalker. This is a brand new story that will be taking it's time as the future expansions go on. Endwalker took years to build up to what it became.

Optional dungeons really shine as well, and the world felt a lot better to explore once I got out from under the abysmal main plot. I know there’s more years of Dawntrail to come, and there are a ton of things that could still go wrong. However, I believe the DT expac itself is now worth the money I spent, subscription notwithstanding. Changing the review to a thumbs up with a caveat that if you primarily play for story or lore, you might want to consider skipping the MSQ. It was rough.Original review: I have been a Final Fantasy XIV player for over 6 years to the tune of close to 3,000 hours. I love this story and this world deeply. I own the lore books and the published side stories. I am the first apologist for the awkward pacing of A Realm Reborn, the character hiccups in Stormblood, and the plot holes of Endwalker.  I have never been as bored and disconnected with the story of Final Fantasy XIV as I have with this expansion. I am still playing the game for social reasons— the combat fills a certain niche for us. However, I cannot recommend Dawntrail at the price Square Enix is charging, plus a monthly subscription, for a handful ( < 10) of instanced dungeons/trials and a promise that better content is coming soon.",1720044916,0,0,positive

Tant pis !J'imagine qu'il fallait contraster avec la plus cérébrale Zero qui venait de passer sur le devant de la scène juste avant, mais cette dernière restera probablement davantage une favorite auprès des joueurs en tant que ""goth waifu"".J'ai vu certains avis râler sur le fait que le rôle de notre personnage passait (pour simplifier) de ""héros"" à ""formateur de héros"", mais personnellement je vois ça comme une évolution logique allant avec la montée de la moyenne d'âge des joueurs : en prenant de la bouteille, on ne se satisfait plus uniquement de ses progrès, mais aussi des progrès que nous pouvons cultiver auprès de ceux qui prendront un jour la relève (enfants pour les parents, élèves pour les profs, collègues junior pour les employés, …), et cette idée de ""relève"" est présente dans le jeu depuis un moment à différents niveaux.De plus, quand on est en début de cycle comme ici, je ne trouve pas ça choquant non plus d'assister à tout ça depuis le côté.La difficulté des donjons et défis reste honnête mais, il me semble, pardonne de moins en moins les erreurs, comme si l'on passait de ""3 erreurs et t'es out"" à ""2 erreurs et t'es out"" : peut-être pour rédonner leur importance aux healers ?Ça plus les mécaniques comme la baisse continue et passive de HP pendant une moitié de combat…Mention spéciale au tout dernier défi, où diverses déclarations de surprise furent lisibles dans la discussion d'équipe.Mes jobs de prédilection (Mage Rouge et Sage) n'ayant pas beaucoup changé dans cette extension je n'ai pas grand-chose à dire à ce niveau, mais je verrai bien en montant tous les autres de 90 à 100 ce que valent les changements qui y ont été apportés… je n'ai pas encore d'avis ""pratique"" à donner pour eux donc.En prenant du recul, la MSQ n'est qu'une petite partie du temps que la plupart des joueurs passeront sur le contenu apporté par Dawntrail et les patchs qui arriveront, et c'est sur ce contenu global que l'extension devra être jugée : Shadowbringers avait une MSQ excellente et des patchs excellents, Endwalker avait une MSQ remarquable et des patchs ""juste bons"", ainsi peut-être aurons-nous ici une MSQ ""juste bonne"" et des patchs excellents ?En l'état je me sens un peu comme après Star Wars 7 : j'ai vu un nouveau départ, qui recycle pas mal d'éléments scénaristiques déjà vus (dont ici, collectionner des cristaux après des épreuves et utiliser les liens noués pour triompher), et qui peut partir dans des directions géniales comme dans d'autres moins glorieuses.Je suis ainsi dans l'attente de voir où la suite nous mènera, et si je souhaiterais que le successeur de Dawntrail ne soit pas à FFXIV ce que le 8ème épisode aura été à Star Wars, au moins ici on a la même équipe aux commandes donc au moins on peut s'attendre à de la cohérence : ici le lore n'est pas qu'une suggestion et lorsqu'il y a retcon, on sait que c'est assez travaillé pour que ça passe (cf. Shadowbringers, avant lequel le studio n'avait aucune idée de la réelle identité des Asciens).""I want to believe"", pour citer le poster d'un célèbre bureau.Mon plus gros regret sur cette extension est peut-être l'absence de mesure supplémentaire pour alléger les inventaires, car lorsque l'on monte toutes les classes chaque emplacement d'inventaire vaut de l'or.Je reconnais toutefois les efforts consentis dans l'extension précédente (suppression des matériaux HQ, suppression des ceintures, ajout d'emplacements dans l'armoire mirage) mais ça ne suffit pas, même en ayant le maximum de servants possible et en employant des moyens peu recommandables comme ""mettre ses objets en vente à des prix prohibitifs pour pouvoir les récupérer quand on veut"".Bref globalement c'est du positif, et j'ai toujours confiance pour la suite.À dans deux ans.",1720038872,1,0,positive

This is a proper de-escalation, going back to ""Just Being An Adventurer"" like the start of the game's main story. It builds back up in the second half, but expect it to be overly positive and upbeat for the first 1/3 of the story until the level 93 8-player trial. This could be as much as 20 hours of playtime where the plot is put in low gear before things begin building up for a climax again.To translate that into Dragon Ball terms, that would be like Kid Goku who fought bandits growing up, killing Freezer in space, then coming back to earth to fight bandits again. This wouldn't be done in Dragon Ball, but it's certainly done here.I wouldn't describe this re-entering High Gear until level 96-97 thereabouts, which could be about 40 hours into the story depending on how you play.For myself, an individual who LOVES the idea of you being an adventurer, a nobody, taking on the mentor role to Wuk Lamat's journey is PERFECT (IN CONCEPT, not execution). It's just that it really does dilly-dally getting to that first trial. I feel that they could have punctuated those first two zones at levels 90-92 with more local threats, specifically combat encounters to make you feel like you are done a lot more than talking.By the time you finish with the first main story arc with Wuk Lamat and you enter the ""save the world"" portion of the story, it doesn't give you sufficient time to get to know certain new characters to make a true emotional connection with them. That second half feels a little rushed. I can't help but feel like that story arc in the second half got rushed in order to give Wuk Lamat's journey in the first half some extra scenes.That said, taking the critical cap off for a second, I enjoyed the entire thing and would like more of it. If I had to ask for anything more, it would be a Eurkea/Bozja/Zadnor style exploration zone in the post patches.I was already enjoying Final Fantasy 14 before this expansion, and this was at the end of the day just more of what I liked.Advice for anyone looking to buy this expansion: Do not try to do the main quest all at once. Multiple people I know have confirmed that it feels exausting to do. It really is best interweaved with other content and over a longer period of time.",1720037358,2,0,positive

76561198024947101,433124,1815,english,"(My DLC hours are because I play primarily on PS5, with Steam as a backup. I have been playing since late ARR.)This is the better A Realm Reborn expansion, or what A Realm Reborn could have been had the developers been given 10 years to hone their craft. The story is a well-executed reset, where we put down our ""main character"" hat, and instead get to be party to someone else's trials, triumphs, and failures, mentoring them along the way. Conversely, going into this expansion wanting even higher stakes than the previous one will lead to disappointment. The writers have decided that they want to shelve the old, and slowly grow a fresh new take on what it means to be a Final Fantasy 14 story, and do it in world in a way that respects the legacy of those that came before.The work they've done on the technical side of the game to improve quest design makes this expansion easy to enjoy. The artists took full advantage of the new graphics update, featuring a high level of detail in the outfits, facial expressions, and foliage. Prior to gaining flight, the zones feel even larger and more real than they did before, because they're able to use the denser foliage to make it feel as though you're actually winding through a forest, or a mountain region. And while a lot of maps have already featured impressive verticality, the new foliage means that those long-distance vistas are full of interesting things to look at, with different perspectives giving new appreciation for the map design. A tower set among a set of trees simply looks impressive from its base, but then its function in the nearby community becomes obvious when you're up high on a cliff, and see it set into the wider landscape.The combination of low (or localized) stakes and the wide variety of music, landscapes, and cultures, makes it feel like this is a summer vacation, where we were invited by the locals to come hang out while nation-wide cultural events take place. It's such a refreshing change of pace from being constantly in fear of the world-ending problems, and possibly losing any companion at any moment.The new raids have yet to release, but the existing selection of combat encounters have also been extremely creative. It's nice to see the developers try completely new things, even if they don't stick long-term. It's also nice to see that the new combat encounters give you much stronger negative feedback when a puzzle isn't solved correctly. It all adds to the thrill of exploration, discovery, and learning!If there is one thing they could have improved, it would be that they could have done a better job integrating the ""long-term"" plot points into the individual side moments. There are many moments which are ultimately essential to the story, but in the moment feel like they are not yet connected. It requires a small amount of patience to take everything in, even as earlier teases tempt a rush to the end.",1720037173,0,0,positive

76561198131318153,0,0,english,"[h2]TL;DR[/h2] at the top because I'm not a monster: 7/10 (8/10 for the first half including dungeons and trials, 6/10 for the second half including dungeons and trials). Story is actually really good if you play the role of mentor/tourist but falls very flat if you want to play the role of 'international hero'. Dungeons and Trials are literally the best they've ever been, and the music is boppin' as always. Most (not all) complaints are shallow and superficial. There just isn't as much hype to drown them out this expac because an arc isn't concluding.[h2]Full Review[/h2] (spoiler free):I don't normally write reviews. I generally don't care what others think about what I thought of a game, but it saddens me to see this expansion being received so divisively when it's actually good! It's just not avatar-centric like the last few have been. So I'm going to add my voice to the chorus of those who are happy with what this expansion is doing.That said, I want to make sure no one going into this is under any misapprehensions. The Dawntrail expansion of FFXIV is written with the intent that you will take it slow and immerse yourself in the cultures you visit. If you are impatient, or just want to get to the part where your character does cool stuff, you will be underwhelmed, not because that stuff doesn't exist, but because this story actively punishes that kind of impatience by denying those players meaningful stakes beyond 'stop obviously bad thing from happening'. If you are patient and like world building/travel and don't want to be the super special chosen one for once, you are free to enjoy this expansion, I promise. If you aren't, well, the dungeons and trails are all A-tier at the very least. If that is ALL you care about, you'll probably like it too. If you want a cool ""you're the hero that saves the world"" storyline, you will not find it here. Your role in this expansion is as an advisor/adventurer/tourist, and there are plenty of opportunities for us to fulfill that role and flex our knowledge or prowess, but the only time we're ever treated as say, the only hope the world has, is at the very end of the expansion.If you came here looking for some good Scion VS Scion content, you won't get much. But maybe that's a good thing. The Scions (both individually and as a group) really do take a backseat this expansion. Your major characters are Wuk Lamat, Erenville, Krile, and then you. Alphinaud and Alisae are with you because they're needed for trust dungeons and also THEY are the ones doing the truly menial dirty work that people often complain about us having to do while the scions advance the plot. This time, we're pretty much present for the entirety of the plot advancement, even if it advances slowly for the first third of the story.This expansion is best thought of as two separate stories, one a sequel to the other, with an intermission in between them. Like what Stormblood should have been rather than its nesting doll of plot threads. You will begin with the advertised rite of succession, on a quest to find the city of gold. The second half of the expansion only happens due to the outcome of the first half, and while I won't spoil anything, I'll admit that the intermission between the two stories goes on for longer than it should, and that the transition into the second story is jarring when it really could have been built up better.The second half of the expansion, again without spoiling anything, explores the duties a ruler has towards a nation, and shows how easily those duties can be ignored or abused. There's a bunch of lore drops planted in this half of the expansion, which I assume will be what we follow up on in patch content.I'd argue this expansion is most like Stormblood, but better paced (not a nesting doll of nonsense) and with more thematically appropriate villains (though I'd hesitate to call either of our endgame villains compelling, an unfortunate similarity they share with Stormblood's big bad, at least as they appear in Stormblood). In fact, our endgame villains are a real low point for me personally, and why I rank the second half of the expansion lower than the first half, where all the villains are much more interesting.Despite what the not recommended votes may say, you can and likely will enjoy this expansion. Even if the story isn't to your liking, the dungeons and trials certainly will be. Unless you're a complete world-building nerd like I am, it probably won't be your favorite, but it's a solid and enjoyable story that's easy to get immersed in. Something to play for say, half a zone at a time and just chill with. It's a marathon, not a sprint.(I may or may not come back to edit this for patch content, but I'm fairly confident mine is a take that will endure.)",1720034935,0,0,positive

It doesn't reach the heights of Shadowbringers story-wise but it was a very fun and refreshing adventure.It's main ""issue"" is that the story hinges heavily on if you like Wuk Lamat or not, and if you don't, you might have a hard time connecting to the story. Which can happen, Stormblood had this issue with Lyse. But I think it's done way better here.Apart from Wuk Lamat, the themes of understanding and discovery of other ways of life continues from previous expansions, with a lot of South-America inspired cultures, which you rarely see in RPGs, so it felt fresh. And the true theme of the expansion, I won't spoil, but I think was treated fairly well, was emotional and well written.Gameplay-wise it's a continuation and refinement of what Endwalker brought, which might not be enough for some but is overall fine by me. The two patches in the next few weeks will probably correct the few mistakes in design here and there. Encounter deisgn is amazing, the best it has been at an expansion launch yet.If you liked FFXIV before, it's more FFXIV. The formula didn't really change, but the meat of it went all out on most parts and is a blast. Oh and the graphical update slaps hard, the game feels amazing to watch.",1720032446,1,0,positive

It is fine when you are slowly introducing different elements and background of the world at the start when the stakes are low, but doing the same thing again and again after raising the stakes killed all momentum in the story.The pacing alone has already made this story a huge slog in the later half of the MSQ, but on top of that, to keep the review spoiler free, the villains motivation made no logical sense and they saw zero development despite 1 of them having 3/4 of the expansion to develop.Last but not least, things also just started to happen just because, the whole second half felt extremely contrived as a result, it would take some next level of suspension of disbelief to enjoy a story like this.Yet, despite the story being crap, gameplay-wise (dungeons, trials, music, maps) are a major step up from the previous expansion, and they are very enjoyable to play through, hence my review is staying positive.",1720031627,6,1,positive

The scenery in this is simply gorgeous and the last Area introduced might be one of my favorites in the entire game. Combat feels genuinely interesting and engaging, not like a thing you can sleep through which if you ask me is a good sign for things going forward. Furthermore it has some awesome quality of life improvement that feel really good to have now.The music has been alright, maybe not as memorable as some of the other ones but it did for good ambiance and a great climax during the third trial.

Is the story on the slower side? Absolutely, but I can only see that as a good thing. Endwalker was epic in its scope in trying to give a proper send off the the Zodiark/Hydalen arc. If Yoshi-p had tried to force feed me something with that pacing and scale again so soon, I may have taken an extended break from FFXIV. Instead, we get a much more cozy story with loads of development into the Turali people. Personally, I love that the WoL gets to take a back seat and not have all of the focus and pressure on them every second of every quest, That is just exhausting, whereas DT has been a breath of fresh air. I find Wuk Lamat to be a genuinely likable character and I was invested in the rite of succession story.

She is extremely bland she is just a fun side character at best imo. So even though the take in the scenario where we are in a mentor position is good I just find Wuk Lamat is not a good disciple for WoL.- Besides that graphics are just the way I'd love it, new textures lightning and style of choice brings your characters so so so much needed life into them! I wholeheartedly believe that. Even though this game is no where near realistic I swear to you, your characters will look photorealistic in certain angles and lights. Like it's really amazing to they managed to create this much life without tempering with the essence of characters. I love the new glams as well very subtly detailed nothing crazy over the top design choices, just simple beauties.- Lastly the gameplay, I've so far cleared the first new dungeon only and can easily say there are improvements in the challenge of the mechanics in a fun way without making it unnecessarily harder. It seems to be just as yoship described them which is something I highly appreciate. Pictomancer is just as I imagined pure fun gameplay with a unique playstyle. I'm still leveling my viper but thats very fine too. There is not much more review needed, new areas, gameplay, graphics are tons of fun with other detailed side content and some I guess not bad but not good story this DLC doesn't falter behind the previous DLC's. Next DLC must obviously increase the tension more hopefully but like I said this is a good pace change.",1720014431,4,0,positive

There will be very soft spoilers in here, but nothing that isn't obvious by the other reviews and by trailers or the late Endwalker-Patchcontent already.Ignoring the usual, bi-annually whining about technical issues a new expansion often has unfortunately......the whinging about Dawntrails story is hilarious for one simple reason: Some of the negative reviews in this regard are so early on in even the early access period, that they DEFINITELY did not actually watch the cutscenes nor red the questtexts or they would not be able to say anything about even 30% of Dawntrails current content. Even funnier is, that as someone who is through the story, i can tell by what they are saying (and not saying) with absolute certainty, they wrote their hogwash complaint before being through half of it. Dawntrail is two stories. While one obviously is tied to the other and the second act cannot exist without the first, it is a vastly different experience than what those crybabies describe here. And i figure most players, and i assume even the players who finished the expansion and did not enjoy it for other reasons, laugh about these morons and its very justified. They should be made fun of.The same goes for people who describe your role in Dawntrail as ""Cameraman"" like some poor fool who i use as a stand in for all the others wrote. In fact you are not the main focus of the story for a majority of Dawntrail. Wuk Lamat is, as the Endwalker Patchcontent already clearly tells you. But its also not like you are not extremely important to that whole storyline. It seems like the people complaining much about Wuk Lamat as a character are the people who get tearyeyed about their gross insult to character design, basic-bi* humunculus not being center stage of every cutscene for a spell... That jealousy for attention of story-senpai (uwu) is in my eyes also the only way to explain why a few people describe her as a Mary Sue, when she is really clearly not that. She begins as a rather weak (reading side-character-that-isn't-scions strong), extremely stupid and guillable character that slowly grows upwards (admitting: Slowly for the span of an expansion, which might still feels quick even tho the expansion tries to tell you it takes place over the span of multiple months) to be stronger and thats only thanks to you and the other people helping her out... which is acknowledged multiple times by Wuk Lamat herself.Dawntrail is fun. Its more relaxed than previous Expansions for... a large part of it, because its not an End of the World Scenario as Shadowbringers and Endwalker were... Thats exactly whats on the box, tho, from the first trailer on...So don't worry about the negative reviews. Most of them are pretty big nonsense... Its good! Its not the best, clearly.

76561198043805736,0,0,english,"I'm a little surprised this is currently in the 'Mixed' category. I wanted to jump in and elaborate that this story was never going to be on the same level as Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Those were solid 10-year build-ups, and DawnTrail is a break into a new storyline after coming out of such insane world-bending highs in those previous two expansions. People who expected more from this going in are kidding themselves, because matching that for a third time in a row would be incredibly difficult.I also want to say, that if you're a chronic cutscene-skipper like me, this is shaping up to be a fantastic expansion in terms of challenging content. The dungeons and trials have been a VERY grateful step up from the rather dull, casually-oriented battle content of Endwalker.In terms of story, it's expectedly better than Stormblood and Heavensward for me, and VERY expectedly not as good as Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The biggest problem I've had is the pacing and how story issues are conveniently solved immediately without build-up, along with a few confusing story elements - overall though, this entry elaborates on some fascinating world lore, has phenomenal new maps, and was a lot more enjoyable than expected. That's saying something for me - I've been playing for 10 years and didn't start paying attention to any story until Shadowbringers, as I found ARR, HW and SB immensely boring. I moreso play for the mass of interesting and challenging content available than story/lore, so I was pleasantly surprised that I could [mostly] pay attention to learning about the new worlds we find in DawnTrail. Remember, it's okay to skip cutscenes here and there if you're losing a bit of interest. You might miss a couple things, but I'm sure there's plenty of people to fill you in, if there was even anything important there in the first place. First half of the story is more relaxed and focused on exploration, and the second half picks up into some more provocative thought-experiments [spoiler]including - but not limited to - moral questions about how we might view the normal functionings of a society we're not part of, and how external views can perceive certain ideals as disturbing.[/spoiler]Overall, immensely excited for the battle content from here. Seems to be leaning more on the mid-tier challenge side for casual content, with some really cool new mechanics, so I'm really expecting Savage to get exciting.

We are not a cheat code that solves everything.

There is more bad than good, but I would still recommend it for those who can deal with the writing. Wuk Lamat is a fine character too, but I do agree that her growth ended too early.

Let me just say, I'm a massive fan of story, so I will speak there first.Indeed, the rumors are true, we definitely take a backseat to this, but they do give us moments to kick ass and take names...even if I sometimes felt like even those moments were...how do I saw...Wuk-ified? But, I honestly don't think it ruined it for me, this expansion is the ARR for the new story line after all...We aren't going to do too much epic cool stuff...This expansion thrives off small moments of satisfaction rather than an overall compelling story line. (I stand by that last statement the most)Characters? Loved all our old buddies...did i miss not having ""the group""...yes. But it didn't ruin it for me, even if i was left wanting. New characters? I say I liked them, nothing felt too odd except for random...growth lets say. Did it give me emotions? Yes. It did. The theme of family is hit or miss, and here, I think it was a well aimed strike. If you don't give a s*it about family, get ready to not understand anything. Read between the lines or grind your teeth in frustration...Okay...Battle. First, let me clarify I am a tank, so while I didn't die, I definitely felt a increase in difficulty, especially on the first trial. (i did it once with npc blind which was fine...but with other players? How did it all go so wrong?) I enjoyed the mechanics thoroughly and never felt bored...minus tank dungeon pulls always, as they ever have, seemed a bit mind-numbing, but it was remedied by the dungeon bosses! I did each duty with npcs first, no issues overall. Then did some with people...and boy do you someone with call outs if you got all new people.For most, that's the basics of a ff14 review, and so, you may wonder, do I buy it? I'd say yes. The story is engaging enough, probably equal to Stormblood. Should you skip story? If you do, only do that for the first half, as the second gets *so* good, chills, if I'm honest. (We get to be badass, and that vibes with me.) What about battle? Love it, npcs didn't fail me, even if people did, but it was all in the good fun of ff14 wiping and a desperate healer lb3.Final results? (i want to rate the story in...first and second chunks for the story skippers.)Story part one: 5/10, babysit and fetch quests that are equal to ARR in tediousness even if the story is still good in my opinion.Story part two: 8/10, While we still follow around, we are badass, kickass, and save others, as the Warrior of Light does best, (with some unsettling and tear-jerking in between)Characters old: 9/10, only problem was we...didn't get much from them, I feel...not even Krile. They were side-lined as much as us...Characters new: 8/10, some...how do i say...convincing arguments were made and kind of just....accepted. Which is boring...I found myself begging to beat some people up and never given the satisfaction...But I did enjoy the characters overall in the end, but definitely not as much as other expansions (Looking at you Shadowbringers....Endwalker...) but it is the ARR of the new arc, so i gave it a bonus 2 points.Battle: 10/10, Equal to Endwalker, I feel...might be even better if I had more to cross-examine. Makes you feel big brain, no boredom, music is epic, satisfaction overall. (But! I will say Endwalker's story for the battles is more compelling, same with Shadowbringers. But that's not what my ""battle"" score is based on)Anyways, thanks for listen to me ramble about one of my favorite games.

Not only that but we're joining someone else for [i]their[/i] story. So while it may seem like this is someone's ""self-insert"", I'd like you to at least see that for every other expansion, [b]we[/b] were quite literally the self-insert for those stories, which is why I see this argument as silly.One of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the story is fairly slow, which I have to ask; Did you play the other expansions? Did you not see that the other expansions [i]all[/i] had world building too? Personally I loved the first half of Dawntrail and how much world and character building we had, especially since we were thrown into Tural, a new continent completely foreign to us, with new characters [b]and races[/b] we haven't seen. I loved seeing the different cultures, and learning about all the new people and how everything ties in to the overarching story. If anything, the only complaint I have with the story, is that the second half of Dawntrail felt too [i]fast[/i], for reasons I obviously cannot disclose here.On top of everything, I think a certain level of expectance was had when it came to DT's content, [i]especially[/i] because of the things that were shown in the Live Letter. If you don't want spoilers for locations or certain characters, do not look at the Live Letters of course. My point is, I think because of these Live Letters, certain people were far more interested in seeing some of the later-game locations (for reasons all too obvious if you've seen the LL), and because of that I feel that some were too eager to get to the end and how the story unfolds with those later areas, rather than the story we have at the start that centres around Tulliyollal. Overall, I think this expansion is one of the greatest chunks of content introduced to FFXIV. I was completely enraptured learning about the different people in Tural and their cultures, and I was in awe at every new piece of content handed to me throughout, from the locations to music to the dungeons.",1720004207,2,0,positive

The second half picks up somewhat but the moment Wuk Lamat makes her entrance it all goes downhill once more.The best zone in this game is the western inspired one ""Shaaloani"".. and the only reason for that is because Wuk Lamat isn't present. You actually feel like your character matters again, and the story told in that singular zone about a random bandit leader was more engaging to me than the entire first half combined.The story of Wuk Lamat is basically just Lyse, the difference however is that Lyse's character arc in SB was just a small part of the greater narrative of resistance against Garlemald. + Combat great+ Second part story somewhat good+ Zone design amazing+ Music = Sokken- Wuk Lamat- First half is just Lyse arc but furry- Character writing is worse, nuance in conversations lost- Tone somewhat schizophrenic, going from ""Pray cook a dish"" to ""We sacrifice hundreds of children"" without warning in about 2 hours.- Once again very formulaic expansion content plan (might be a good thing for some)- Power of Friendship and Talk-nojutsu (and food) basically ends every conflict in this expansion.*- Despite the marketing material making it look like you are going on an adventure this is not the feel I got, more like working down a laundry list of tasks Papa Gulool gave us.* Power of Friendship and to some degree talk-nojutsu have always been a part of FF14 but not to this degree. Power of Friendship moments in previous expansion were earned and in some cases literally written into lore how they are possible. Talk-nojustsu was used sparingly as well. This expansion gives no shits and just goes full hog on this. Wuk Lamat *will* get her way no matter what.TL:DRDissapointing story with good combat. Haven't tried all classes yet but the ones I have seem well balanced and fun to play6/10The reason why I still give it a thumbs down is because Wuk Lamat is so unbearable she somewhat soured the battle content for me...EDIT: [SPOILERS]'ight I'm dropping this to a 4.5/10. At the time I wrote this review I wasn't entirely done. But after the dragon scene I had to stop playing (literally alt-f4). Why was that scene necessary? Oh, so you are telling me Tural, a place that didnt have much connection to the outside world suddenly enters and alliance with Rhad-zhat han mere moments before the final battle? You are telling me Vtra who's people still suffer from the effects of the final days, is willing to abandon his people go to the other side of the world and fight an enemy he knows NOTHING about without a SINGLE scene to build it up? And the cherry on top the fucking Endwalker trailer music? Why? It had nothing to do with the scene. I don't know who greenlit this scene but fcking hell it sure feels like the writer himself wasnt confident about this expansion so he needed to take from the previous one.Complete miss CBU3, fcking hell. :(EDIT²: [SPOILERS]The last zone is absolutely gorgeous.. still doesn't make up for the rest of the story though.EDIT³: [SPOILERS]The last zone, specifically the conversation between Krile and her parents and everything that comes after adds a lot of plotholes unfortunately.The Milalas are from the Source and during the 5th Umbral Calamity they fled to the Alexandrian reflection... then why is Krile's Soul Source level dense? The denseness of a soul isn't hereditary, else Varis *Emet Selch's son* would have been Ascian level powerful but he wasn't. Meaning Krile's soul should be as dense as that of a reflection's soul but it isnt else Y'shtola would have realized that by now. *IF* we take this as a retcon to how souls work than it's still wrong. The Milalas left during the 5th Umbral Calamity, as such they are 5 times rejoined while the rest of the source now is 6 times rejoined, again Y'shtola should have seen a difference...EDIT ^4:I'm changing my review from negative to positive. The story is still dogwater but the raid tier is peak, probably the best the game has gotten. Even though this *is* a story focused game the gameplay this time around is carrying... I hope the story can reach such highs in the patch content as well.",1719998343,0,0,positive

76561198079073462,219565,2370,english,"From what we have currently I expect Dawntrail will become similar to Stormblood, where the story is seen as somewhat weak but the bosses and raids are seen in a more positive light.The story is a slow burn, the first half is very low stakes but probably the best justified use of 14's story flow of ""go to place, learn about the people that live there, help them out, go to next place"". The second half picks up the stakes and certainly comes off stronger for it. Being an all-new area and such means there's no pre-existing investment like there was with Endwalker, though, so anyone expecting the same level or amount of payoffs will probably be disappointed.Both the normal difficulty and extreme bosses are some of the most interesting in the game, gameplay-wise. Even some of the regular dungeon encounters had things happening that took me by surprise and the main story bosses felt much faster-paced and exciting from a gameplay perspective than Endwalker's.Job changes seem to be a mixed bag. Having only really played Monk and Gunbreaker so far I appreciate the removal of damage from GNB's gap closer so that it can be used to close gaps without feeling like a waste, but Monk feels like it wants a finer pass, as there are some odd quirks from the changes to the numbers, such as Tornado Kick being useless before you get Phoenix Rising and AoE as a whole being weaker because of the removal of Disciplined Fist despite single target being stronger. I'm hopeful these sorts of quirks will be ironed out in future between regular changes and the major patches.Overall I think it's a good time, but one that's probably going to be remembered for its encounter design and battle content over its storyline and new characters.",1719997443,4,0,positive

76561198242329512,0,0,english,"Having played Dawntrail from the early access and being near the end of the MSQ, here are my impressions:MSQThe story is a very simple story about making peace and finding unity through mutual understanding. While it is by no means unique, I personally have needed a sweet and simple story like this in recent times. One area where I think the messaging needed improvement was how heavy-handed it was. The time spent repeating the same message to hammer it in is time they could have spent better, like spending more time with underutilized characters. The focal point of this story is the character Wuk Lamat and you spend most of the MSQ with her. I personally liked her as a character but I still think that the time alotted to different characters could have been split slightly more evenly. If you do not like Wuk Lamat, then you will probably not enjoy MSQ too much. Another group I think is involved too much is the original cast of the Scions. While I expect that every expansion is still going to contain them to some extent, I was hoping that them disbanding would mean they would show up as individual characters in a bigger cast instead of as a group. However, this was already advertised before launch so I expected it.New AreasI really like the new areas in Tural. They are very varied and colorful and I have had fun exploring them. I do not have much more to say as of now as I have mostly focused on MSQ.New ClassesI have decided to play Dawntrail as a Pictomancer after previously mostly playing Red Mage through all expansion MSQs since I started playing last year. I have enjoyed Pictomancer quite a bit. While Red Mage is mostly a relatively straightforward and fun class in terms of building resources and spending them as well as great freedom of movement, I have found that Pictomancer requires a bit more forethought. All oGCDs and all GCDs with no cast time are tied to building resources. You either have to have your Canvases prepped for the Muse spells or have built up Paint from continuing your filler GCDs. Both are required for good burst phases AND for situations where you may have to be consistently on the move, which are more common in Dawntrail.I have not had the opportunity to try Viper. I only have one criticism: Adding two DPS classes has made queue times rather long. I ended up playing mostly Duty Support both for leveling and MSQ.New Dungeons/Trials:The basic dungeons and trials have more hectic mechanics in the sense that there is a lot more time based overlapping aoes or special aoe patterns you need to remember. It's honestly fun even though some of them are a bit of a pain because you can get insta-killed easily by some of them if you make mistakes. All that is naturally a part of learning the patterns and such so that in itself wasn't really a problem. However, it can be quite boring on Duty Support, if there is a specific mechanic you are struggling with that has you restart the fight over and over.Overall I would personally recommend Dawntrail. However, if you do not think you will like MSQ based on what you know now, and if the other points are not big selling points for you, it may be wise to wait until future patches before purchasing.",1719994648,4,0,positive

The best way to view the story would to be to go in under the perspective of an Epilogue almost.

To start with positives: Locations are really nice. Each zone was unique and stood out from previous expansion in a way that you can tell which is which despite some looking the same (great detail to vegetation).Dungeons and Trials are easily the best in the game.Great challenge in the Trials. Yoshi P was being serious when he said he wanted it to be less stress free. Got multiple party wipes in the second trial despite doing with other players.Wuk Lamat feels a very natural fit for the story. What she learns in the first half, she continues to use them in the second half really showing her growth and the story is mostly about her. Definitely doesn't feel as shoehorned as Lyse in Stormblood.Second half is the strongest part of the expansion in the story. The stakes feel just right giving me Shadowbringers feels.Some of the valid criticisms I've seen are:Wuk Lamat is with you for a bit too long, especially during the second half.More voiced cutscenes.Repetitive MSQ patterns that probably needs newer or improved styles (given area, find and talk to these people).Some things that could've been solved easily if our WoL didn't just stand there, especially after all the things we did in our journeyMy own personal nitpicks (Very very light spoiler):I didn't like how the two trials I've done had NPC Trust to do with. It removes the uniqueness that was the second trial in Endwalker and the emotional and gameplay impact I had. I think this is also where I felt that Wuk Lamat was there with you for a bit too much. Having the WoL show their power would feel much more satisfying in showing their strength to Wuk Lamat and other competitors as to who they're competing with.Basically for me it's like this for me nowSHB > EW > HW = DT > SB > ARRA great expansion, knowing the fact that it won't reach the heights of EW and SHB only because it's the start of a new journey.",1719985551,0,0,positive

Good stories have rises and falls in action.The story's solid as long as you're comfortable not being the main spotlight for quite a bit of it. As much as people are frustrated that they're not the center of attention during the MSQ, it's allowed for quite a bit of subtle, but plentiful moments for the WoL to flex their knowledge and strength as an experienced veteran as a mentor for Wuk Lamat & Co. All the EN voice acting feels on the same level as the rest of FFXIV's expansions, which has never been amazingly directed. Content's fun, new lore implications are fun, new music's fun.

""The New World"" has been a location that many people have been wishing to travel to for a long time now, we finally get there, and people are seemingly upset that a grand portion of the game is relegated to learning about the people, and cultures of the people who live there? I don't understand. I'm happy that I was able to learn so much about the inhabitants of Tural, it's nice to learn about several cultures I've been interested in for so long, in a grounded setting, especially after the last few expansions.On the topic of Wuk Lamat, while she is in a few many cutscenes I'd say it's due to the fact that she's the main character in this story, not us. We were hired in order to help her win the rite of succession, and we did just that. Does she fall into a few shounen tropes? Absolutely, but at the same time I think it's unfair to say that means she isn't a well written character. She is. She isn't like Lyse during stormblood, she's better. Also, some of you really can't handle not being the center of attention for an expansion, lmao.The only gripes I have are with some of the antagonists, but not the final antagonist, I love them.

The story starts out slow, given that this is the start of another multi-expansion storyline, there's a fair bit of worldbuilding needing to be done, if anyone expected this to be on the level of Shadowbringers or Endwalker, they're delusional.That said, the pacing, especially in the very beginning, is atrocious. Getting to the first dungeon felt like an absolute slog, and this MSQ feels particularly unbalanced in terms of cutscenes over solo duties. Somewhat worrisome since it feels like SE used to be able to blend exposition and actual gameplay better.That said, while the first half of the story feels reminiscent of ARR, for better and worse, the second half really picks things up and throws some things for a loop. Both the art and music team have done an excellent job once again, and the dungeons and trials have been a step up from the offerings we've had in Endwalker so far. I feel like this will basically become Stormblood 2.0, a mixed reception over a decent, but poorly paced MSQ, and very strong endgame content. PS.

76561198036773503,0,0,english,"This is an excellent expansion, writing as someone who got into the game just a few years ago with the Endwalker release. I'm not fully through the story yet, still in the 97-98 range, but what I have played through has compelled me to comment.First off, this expansion's story is a huge shout out to RP'ers, both those who publicly rp in the game, and those who simply tell private stories with their friends. The arc of the WoL as a protagonist, from ARR to now, has gone through so many twists and turns, bumps in the road, sorrows and triumphs, that the fact that your character is not the primary focus of the story feels... RIGHT. Last expansion was literally an end-of-everything style apocalypse plot! There was no where left to go in terms of insane power creep save for falling down the same mistakes that so many stories plotted without an end do, introducing the next ""Bigger Bad that was Totally The Real Threat All Along"" ad nauseam until the playerbase faded away. Instead, the story sits down and acknowledges your accomplishments. Even while going to a distant land that your character is a relative unknown to, the dichotomy of newcomers meeting and sizing you up for the first time, and those who know you and what you have done, makes the world feel immersive and real. Rather than forcing your character to contend with ever larger and more ridiculous narrative threats, it examines the sole hero narrative, placing you before trials that you, the Warrior of Light, Savior of... well, everything, can absolutely take head on, but pose a threat to others who are not legendary heroes in the same way. You are one person, and you can't be everywhere at once, no matter how powerful. But you aren't alone. One of the main focuses of this story is on the connections that people forge, even where walls of culture, technology, and social standing rise between them. The supporting cast in this expansion is some of the strongest yet, reoccurring characters displaying the years of development they have received, and your character taking on a mentor role to newer characters joining us for the first time. These characters, old and new, look up to you, both as a supernatural and terrifying force of destruction that you must be as an MMO protag with over a decade of content behind you; and as a person, one who has been through all the hardships the world has thrown at them, and come out scarred, older, wiser, and most importantly, choosing to remain kind. (Obvious caveat to the above, the story is written with the assumption that the story in your head matches, or at least follows the major beats of, the story being told by the game. It is an MMO, there can only be so much variation/branching in the story, so it may feel a bit off if you are writing your Warrior of Light as LordDarknessEdgeMurder. But that's not really something the writing team can account for :P)Changing streams of thought, the gameplay so far has been excellent. There has been a total of 1 new dungeon I found a little lackluster, while the lvl 97 dungeon is easily one of my favorite in the game as a whole. The one trial I've done was a blast, especially going in blind and playing in voice chat with friends. The graphics update, while not strictly connected to this product, is beautiful.Overall, a big recommend from me.",1719977513,0,0,positive

76561197971221107,207627,11,english,"7/10. I will be going on tangents here, so the review might be super incoherrent - clear signs of my impending dementia and possible shizophrenia. Might contain referencial spoilers but, honestly, by the end of this, due to the questionable structure and obscure writing of this review, you will have forgotten it anyway.I both like and dislike Wuk. I like her because she is that 'genki' kinda gal that has that 'rush B' mentality but she definitely needed development. Some crisis or deep conflict to push her forward as a character but all her 'challenges' were done and forgotten in 20 minutes, making me believe that she is either deus ex machina or the writers needed to combine all PG-13 shounen protagonists of the past 10 years into one. Wuk aside for a second, lore dumps were real - adventuring was not. The writing literally was offensive. Offensive to my below average troglodyte brain as I not only get the same information presented thrice but, when prompted to do a quiz about it, even get blatant hints (read: solutions) as to which one is correct. I also do not have faith in the average playerbase of an MMO but, for the love of god, it is, as they say and as it was advertised 'A. NEW. BEGINNING.' - Be at least THAT daring.Aside from that, you got ""Empire strikes back"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"", Xenogears, with a touch of Naruto. I'd say El Dorado but they took the fun out of that as people have already seen it, apparently. Every zone is a hyperbolic time-chamber for the main character and by the end Son Goku easily can tank more damage than you, Heal more than you and out-dps you by spamming her AoE-rotation. So much so that, when getting literally kicked out of the Matrix, she wills herself back in and, in turn, even destroys Windows Firewall apparently. The tribal princess is so gifted in a technology she has superficially seen for a total of an hour that she literally did become Hackercat when required. Again, Hyperbolic time-chamber zones... German VAs were nice, Llama Tea included. Towards the end, the janitor got to speak a character which is probably due to funding problems after literally saving Squenix from financial ruin single-handedly. A memorable performance worthy of a 'new beginning'. Speaking of, the entire story might have been written by mediocre movie-buff chat-GPT. Which... given Squenix still holding on tight to pyramid-schemes like NFTs and scams like genAI, the possibility is non-zero.There are pacing issues. There are lots of inconsistencies. There is no player agency story-wise and if I had the option, I'd wear the 'I rather be someplace else'. badge with pride. Then again, I would have missed out on Grandpa Cat who was genuinely funny in delivery. It feels like the entire first half of the Expac might have been planned as some kind of Post-expac MSQ with the 2nd half being a very compressed and condensed actual expac. It would explain why the first half feels rushed. It would explain why the 2nd half gets traction but was over before it has begun. Either that or someone cut out 50% of the actual first half and just tacked the 2nd half onto it with nanofiber threads.People also say that this is a new beginning. It is a beginning that wrapped itself up by the end of the expansion. There is one unspecified glowing Bad Dragon toy with weird markings on it that has not yet explained but we essentially did a Tural 100% speedrun, no major glitches. It proves that having some form of Cognitive Dissonance is vital to uphold the status of the absurd and make for a solid peace of mind on shaky foundations.To say some good things: Dungeons and Trials are baller. Music is just banger after banger after banger. Classes are fine unless you are a cynical mid-thirties yearning for a time long past - Classic is coming eventually. Just stop playing until then so you can farm Coils again ad nauseam but super-optimized with your personal elitist fap-squad of like-minded individuals. Trust.Therefore: I do not like it. I do not dislike it. Lamati'y is cute and I wish her character gets a reboot with actual growth through actual struggle and actual suffering (+ the overcoming of these 2) that makes her interesting and deserve the expac ending song.So, for now, I give it a Wuk Lamat out of Lamati'y.",1719976142,1,0,positive

There's a whole lot more going on in the world than just Wuk Lamat, and I'll be honest even if the story started off a little slow it snowballed really hard into having a lot of intrigue. Now granted I'm not through the story as a whole yet so I can't say for certain but I can say:I think Wuk Lamat is a compelling character, I know there's a lot of people who are being pissy about her because the voice actress is atrans woman, of course no one will actually come out and say that. (And of course I'm not saying everyone who has a negative opinion on the game is that way, just there are some people that are like that.) But I think she did a very good job of selling being a likable naive character. I do think she struggled at carrying scenes that involved her appealing to a the larger narrative but when she was in personal conversation with people I could absolutely see the charm of the character.It might seem like there you're just babysitting Wuk Lamat at first, and yeah I can see how that can get a little boring, I had a couple of moments where I was bored too. But I don't really agree at all that this expansion is at all bad, Wuk Lamat's story isn't enough to carry the whole expansion, but pretty much from the start they start putting down other plot threads and curiosities for the player as long as you're paying attention. And avoiding major spoilers, the whole Dawnservent side of the story only lasts for about half of the expansion, after that everything starts to open up and those little plot elements start paying off.So yeah, overall I can somewhat see where people are coming from, and I do think there are some parts of the story that are boring/underdeveloped/ect. But I feel like there's a good chunk of negative reviews that are just being haters, or just didn't actually pay attention to the story.I think overall this is a decent expansion, it's met my expectations thus far, and I'm looking forward to playing more.",1719974897,1,0,positive

(I've been playing in French, wish I understood French though.. lol)Some of the english text localization seems odd, and dialogue options for the player are very corny compared to older DLC though..I'm sorta confused with some of the complaints for the graphics, cause to me they look pretty good. and I've noticed no real difference to my face, but I did upgrade from a gaming laptop to desktop since last actively playing.Been playing nearly nonstop for the past few days and really wanna get to the end.",1719965339,0,0,positive

It's Masayoshi Soken, grand-slam hitter for 6 expansions in a row now)-The new environments and side quests are clever and really add a lot to the lore and story-What we know about the future of the Dawntrail patch cycle paints a really bright picture for the next few years of the game, with so much content in the works for all types of player that everyone will find something to enjoyThanks for reading.

The second half though I finally felt engaged; there are some interesting questions and lore implications that they introduced, and it does feel like a fertile place to explore, lore wise especially if we start exploring more reflections. Despite my reservations with the story, the battle content has been incredible, and I'm genuinely impressed with how creative they've been with boss encounters; and can't wait for when raids, the ultimate, field operations, criterion dungeons, deep dungeons are released during the patch cycles.

Personally, I enjoyed the expansion. It did it's main job well, which was to set us up for the next 10 years of content and I'm excited to go on that journey, and especially excited to see how everything ties together with our time in the Thirteenth.The only thing I really had an issue with was some of the voice actors they chose for background/side characters did kind of sound like they were from a badly dubbed anime, so I hope the voice direction for the post-expansion does better on that front.Even if you don't enjoy the story content though, what you will most likely be spending the majority of your time doing is playing the new game content which has been incredibly fun so far and we haven't even gotten savage yet.",1719959223,2,0,positive

76561198119412692,0,0,english,"The story feels like a sequel. A new character takes the main stage and we are as mentors. While imperfect it's very wholesome. It's pretty unique compared to what we've seen so far in 14. I'd say it's quite controversial too. It had a really slow rough start with many issues but it improved massively later in the last two zones. It's not for everyone and I appreciate the fact that they're trying things. They aren't risking much really but it's more than they used to. And for the lore nerds there are so many implications of things that could potentially happen that thinking about it is quite exciting.The combat design is massively improved, though fights are a bit spongy and the new jobs are lovely. Overall worth experiencing for new players and veterans alike. The new instanced content(normal modes, to be precise) is greatly improved. The first two trials were lovely with some new and creative mechanics, the leveling dungeons became faster and more engaging, while keeping the difficulty not too high for your average player. I didn't like the optional dungeons because they were overdone, some fights had unclear telegraphs, at times the camera would be harder than the boss itself, while other just depended too much on their server ticks not being so bad. This one fight in particular isn't *hard* but it's not enjoyable when you have to think about how things would be seconds ahead of what is on your screen in order to clear. It's not a unique thing but the problem is much more obvious with this type of mechanic. Unless they somehow fix that issue I don't believe such a mechanic belongs in the game.The new graphical update also improved things quite a bit, while barely touching performance and adding DLSS&FSR, although poorly for now. If fixed DLSS could be a great addition to the game. The ugly green filter is pretty much gone and thank god. The lighting, the textures, the characters, their expressiveness, emotes, things come alive and end up being so much prettier.",1719956477,3,0,positive

I don't understand the complaints against Wuk Lamat...she grows as a character and that's the whole point of any storytelling. We help her grow and learn more on her journey.- The cultures portrayed are rich and detailed.- So far the storytelling has been mostly light-hearted and fun which was expected, and is enjoyable.- I enjoy the music, I think it's interesting compared to past expansions, there is quite a few remixes of older music, but there is some new jazzy tunes which are cool. There is one specific song that reminds me a bit of Studio Ghibli which I love, it's very calming.I'll update this review more when I have more to add.",1719955980,1,0,positive

To top it all off... the story is just so much fun!With the addition of Wuk Lamat as a character, she truly is the face of DawnTrail. She is one of the big reasons why this expansion is just so enjoyable and only gets me hyped for the story (plus she is precious bean that deserves the world).YoshiP wanted to make this the expansion a return to more  traditional Final Fantasy and that was absolutely achieved.

We're following the journey of people who already did what we did to unlock a secret for the future of the people, and to help make someone ""king"" of a people.It's One Piece. The end.The unfortunate part is, those who have legit criticisms will end up getting lumped in with the folks who are the worst kind of people review bombing this. If you're upset you're not the main part of the story: I'm sorry but that's honestly been tiring for the past 2 expacs.If you're upset Krile wasn't a bigger part of it? I get it. And that's valid.If you just don't like Wuk Lamat, I understand, but also think you're wrong. But I won't say you HAVE to like her (i'll meme about it, but take it in stride, it's like saying someone HAS to hate pineapple on pizza or something. No one takes those people seriously)This is our vacation arc, our mentor arc, and our One Piece arc. I hope you enjoy it. And if not, hopefully you'll enjoy something in the future. Sadly, they cannot make EVERYONE happy with the story. There are people who think any part of the FFXIV expacs are bad. I personally hate Heavensward. I think it's the worst. Some people love it. I honestly liked Shadowbringers the best, Stormblood after, and Endwalker after that. And so far, I really like this one. I'm not done, I have heard the ending is rushed, but if it's less rushed than Endwalkers, so be it.Enjoy yourselves. and if you're not enjoying it, maybe find something else to play instead.

While many people are complaining she takes the ""spotlight"" away from the Warrior of Light, there is no other character I'd be happier to lend that spotlight too. Her story and development are very engaging, and I enjoyed every moment supporting her journey. She will definitely be a pillar in the coming expansions, and I can't wait to see how she further develops. Its definitely a change going from saving the entire universe in Endwalker to supporting Wuk Lamat on her journey, but it is a welcome change. Its nice to only have the weight of a country on our shoulders, and not the entire world for once. It is a very relaxing expansion overall, but with enough actions and drama to keep it interesting.While the amount of new information reminds me of A Realm Reborn, it improves from that in every way. It's much less of an info dump, and does a great job at making the world seem real and like its always been next door to Eorzea.

The two new DPS jobs are also really well made and easy to pick up for someone new with tons of room to learn. I'd say that the entire second half of this expansion makes up for the lack of proper pacing within the first half. Once it gets started it snowballs and became an emotional and amazing experience for me. Dawntrail has a ton of character development and treats your Warrior of LIght as a side character for the most part due to what is going on in the plot, which is okay. It could have been done better but I still enjoyed my time with this expansion and in the end, it has a special place in my heart for how it made me feel.

76561198319508923,0,0,german,"Zuallererst, es soll eine komplett neue Saga erzählen, es soll sich langsam aber schön erzählen, was auch gesagt worden ist in einem der Vorstellungen.Ich habe es jetzt durchgespielt ohne Story-Skip oder ohne irgendeine Cutscene ausgelassen zu haben, klar ist es rein vom ""Action"" lange nicht so wie Shadowbringers oder Endwaker, aber genau das ist ja der Sinn hinter Dawntrail, es soll ein Urlaub darstellen wo nicht die ganze Welt untergeht.Für mich persönlich eins der schönsten DLC von FFXIV ich hatte nie das gefühl etwas skippen zu müssen, was ich bei jedem anderen DLC außer Shadowbringers auch getan habe wiel es sich so ""langweilig"" angefühlt hat, nicht weil es das war, sondern einfach ein persönliches befinden... Ich lese viel das die Story sehr langweilig ist oder das es keine Action habe oder gar das es erst ab ~ 60% der Story interessant ist, was jedem persönlich auch zusteht, aber zu sagen das es nicht an Endwaker oder Shadowbringer rankommt ist verständlich, die Story wwar da schon in vollem gange, was sehr viele leider vergessen... [h1] Pro: [/h1][list][*]Die Story finde ich persönlich super schön da man einfach in eine neue schön, Farbenfrohe, mal nicht so leere Welt kommt.[*]Die Charakterentwicklung ist super, die Entwickler haben so mit meinen Gefühlen gespielt, wie ich schon lange nicht in einem solchem Spiel hatte, erst dachte ich ich muss die eine Person hassen, dnnach habe ich diese angefangen zu lieben, ähnlich wie bei Emet aus Endwaker bzw allg. den Ascians.[*]Die Gebiete sind wunderschön und lehrt uns sogar die schönen Momente zu genießen.[*]Der ""Endboss"", und allg. die Dungeons und Prüfungen sind super cool gemacht nicht sonderlich schwer aber trotzdem ein schönes Erlebnis beim ersten mal.[*]Die neuen Klassen sind super, lassen sich schön spielen und erlernen.[*]Es gab überhaupt keine Server-Probleme an EA Veröffentlichung am 28. Juni (zumindest nicht auf (Light->(Raiden)))[*]Die Synchro ist super (bis auf in Contra erwähnt, Wuk Lamat im Englischen)[/list][h1] Contra: [/h1][list][*]Die Englische Synchro ist nicht sonderlich gut bei Wuk Lamat, nicht ohne Grund sind sehr viele schlechte Reviews davon betroffen, aber Lyse aus Shadowbringers war auch nicht sonderlich gut...[*]Ich wollte eigentlich die ganzen neues Dungeons nicht mit Inhaltshelfern das erste mal bestreiten sondern per Suche mit anderen Leute, das hat so Semi funktioniert, da zurzeit eine Art Streik von Supportern auftaumelt, was ich sehr schade finde, da diese jetzt durch die Buffs der anderen Klassen entlastet werden, aber zum Punkt warum das so Semi funktioniert hat ist folgender: 2 DPS (mich eingeschlossen) und der Tank haben die Mechanik nicht sofort durchblickt und hätten neustarten müssen, der Healer hingegen wusste wie diese gemacht gehört, statt das dieser uns es kurz gesagt hätte, hat er den Dungeon einfach verlassen, klar dieser hat auch eine Suche von 10 Sekunden wohingegen DPS oftmals eine Suche von 5-10 Min hat.... Wenn das so weiter geht sollten bitte diese Healer einfach keine Healer mehr spielen und den Leuten nicht den ganzen Spaß kaputt machen...[*]Wuk Lamat in meinen Augen wird zum Ende hingegen zu Stark, ohne das groß eregnisse passiert wären die diese so gestärkt hätte, am Ende des Endwaker DLC im Growing Light Kapitel, hatte sie Angst vor einem Pelikan und jetzt kann sie auf einmal Fette Roboter geschätzt mit einem Schlag kaputt machen..[*]Schön wäre es gewesen wenn sie nicht nur DPS als neue Klassen eingefügt hätten (was bestimmt noch kommen wird) [/list][h1] Fazit: [/h1]Es war mal wieder eine schöne Reise mit unserem Helden die ich so schnell nicht vergessen werde, es war eine Geschichte die mich auch im echten Leben zum nachdenken gebracht hat, was nicht sonderlich viele Spiele schaffen, wer einfach mal Auszeit als Weltretter braucht, ist hier auf jeden Fall aufgehoben, wenn man nur die Pure Action sucht, sollte es sich überlegen entweder zu warten oder sogar einfach das Spiel wechseln bis neue Inhalte erscheinen.Oft hatte ich das Gefühl das Leute dieses Spiel nur noch spielen eben weil sie es Spielen als zwang.Viele haben sich auch beschwert weil sie es nicht verstanden haben wie man in das EA rein kommt, was ich überhaupt nicht verstehe, da auf der Mogry Station alles gut erklärt wird, die Collecors Edition habe ich nicht, daher kann ich nicht sagen wie es da ist, aber wenn man solche Probleme hat, soll man bitte einfach zum Support gehen oder die Suchmaschine anwerfen.",1719945765,18,1,positive

I think there's a lot to love about this expac already, and even if first impressions are everything it's pretty sad to see that so many people are legit getting filtered by how it starts out.In short, some of y'all haven't played FFXI and it shows, overall Dawntrail has a wonderful [spoiler]coming of age story wherein you take up the role of a mentor of sorts, not unlike the relationship that the player character in one of XI's storylines often falls into against it's expansions female leads, just expanded far further than XI's storytelling ever went.

76561198106981382,0,0,english,"Day 1 of official release, and just finished the 7.0 MSQ.It's a solid expansion, that unfortunately suffers from the flaws of hinging on a single character moreso than Stormblood, and in a way that isn't as easy to ignore.If you don't like the character's shonen protagonist energy, the expansion's first arc is insufferable. Even as someone who has a soft spot for the character in question, I won't deny the first... 10-15 hours is an ARR-level slog. Obviously beginning of a new arc and all that, but I think a lot of people underestimated how much of a slog it was going to be, especially if you're rushing through the story as much as possible to avoid spoilers.That being said though, the second arc is masterful, and brought me to tears more than Endwalker ever did. Lots of emotional payoff, some tear-jerking moments, and enough character/world lore to keep me theorising for a long time.All of this, punctuated by Soken and the sound team cooking even harder than ever before (Who'd ever think Yakuza and Monster Hunter music would go hard in an FF14 fight?), and some of the best encounter design we've had for several expansions. Dungeons are actually spicy now, and every single trial fight currently in the base game would be a top 10 entry in their own right. If I had to offer my own personal criticisms, I'd prefer to see more action between the setpieces like dungeons and trials, and I do think the quest design is due an overhaul. I like the heavy emphasis this game places on storytelling, but sometimes it can get a bit tedious when there's nothing to fight for over an hour.Overall, with all this considered, I'd probably rank it a 9/10 overall, with a heavy emphasis on ""It has a very slow start and takes a while to get going"". Personally clears Shadowbringers for me in terms of story, and Endwalker in terms of encounter design, but as a whole package, I'd probably place it second, below Stormblood.",1719943130,2,0,positive
76561198025135408,0,0,english,"Early access player here.It is never easy to scale back after a big, epic finale. Endwalker saw the end of a decade long saga of loss, betrayal, renewed hope, and worldbuilding. We went from being just another scion to a true Warrior of Light, repelling invaders, ending ancient conspiracies, liberating entire nations, saving parallel worlds, then saving existence. Naturally, we wondered where we'd go from  there.None of us thought we'd go on vacation, and help a fledgling princess claim her throne.There's been no small amount of controversy over the writing of Dawntrail. It's certainly more comedic and lighthearted, for the most part, than most of FFXIV. While I can sympathize with this viewpoint that we're 'babysitting Wuk Lamat' after a decade's worth of buildup, this is merely the start of a new arc. Besides, the new cast of characters have been nothing short of fantastic and likable. The worldbuilding is wonderful, providing a unique setting among fantasy media. Tural is vibrant and full of life, in no small part due to the graphical updates. And the story has it's fair share of surprises, hidden from view until the end...In regards to combat, it still feels as good as ever, although healers seriously need some more attention, love, and care from the development team. I do not feel adding two DPS jobs for Dawntrail was the right call, as much as I enjoy the role. Warrior also still needs a serious rebalancing, a complaint I've held since Endwalker. I understand what the job is supposed to bring to the table, but maybe it should have less tools to keep moving without a healer. And I'm saying this as a tank main, myself.Overall, fantastic expansion, and can't wait to see where this new story arc goes.",1719943126,2,0,positive

This isn't Shadowbringers, nor is it Endwalker, and to expect as much is foolish. I'm maybe 68% or 70& through the story, and it's by far meeting all expectations I had, going into this. The characters are well written, the display of actual cultural diversity is well done. As well as the dungeons and trials I have faced thus far. In fact I'd say both have outdone the design and gameplay of Endwalker by miles. Not to mention Viper, a class I leveled to 90 day one, is exceptionally well designed. Hell even beyond that, the server's themselves have not only been relatively stable, but ques have been moving fairly quickly.

For starters, on my server, there have been no connection instabilities and queues are most of the time non-existant or shorter than 2K — nothing short of a miracle, if you ask me. As for the content iself, In my opinion, this turns out to be the best expansion we've had on FFXIV, because even though some leveling dungeons aren't as great as Stormblood's, the Trials are amazing and the Expert dungeons finally feature fun mechanics, more akin to Normal and Alliance raids.Instead of introducing yet another layer to the original story arc — which is what Dragon Quest X latest expansions unfortunately keep doing ceaselessly — we've been granted a broader look on worldbuilding and new side characters get a good amount of screentime. The latter half of the expansion builds a great stage that gives meaning for the characters introduced in the ""adventuresque"" first half, and even antagonists that could easily have been left behind get to take part. The maps are a breath of fresh air, the BGMs are great and the numerous throwbacks to FF8, FF9 and FF11 hit like a love letter.Now, while this may not be the worst expansion some are claiming it to be, it is surely the one with the most insufferable amount of soulless complaints. From people complaining they feel useless as healers (while most won't even cast damage spells or care about their uptime) and others who seem to hold Shadowbringers and Endwalker as the golden standards for the game (many being newcomers to it and Pandæmonium being as boring as it can get) as if nothing good could come from doing something different, it's as hard as it's ever been to feel like a part of the community. As if carrying lazy heads on Duty Finder and Party Finder wasn't bad enough. I mean — come on, it's been [b]nine years[/b] since Heavensward was released. People should know doubles, light party stacks and spreads by now.",1719935313,7,0,positive
76561197994074295,0,0,english,"I love Wuk Lamat tbhAlso all the reviews saying we are basically a supporting character in the story, have apparently missed that is what the WoL has always been. We do fetch quests, we endear ourselves to other people and cultures and spend most of the time listening and we get to say one, inconsequential statement every 10 minutes or so of cutscenes. All the other characters do the thinking for you, you simply just do the fighting. Also considering that they are starting from the ground up in a new saga, it's easy to think this story is weak but it's simply slower and feels more like ARR, which I was admittely a fan of the slow pacing as you ramp up all the way to EW.",1719935286,3,1,positive

While I know a slow-burn plot isn't everyone's cup of tea, I found myself completely engaged with how the story unfolded this time around. I absolutely adored the world-building. I loved getting to know all the characters and their quirks, personalities, and their backgrounds. It actually made me care for the characters and NPCs for once. I liked how I took a part in their story, instead of the other way around. The story managed to keep me engaged the entire time throughout, which previous expansions couldn't do. It's incredibly refreshing not being the all-powerful hero saving the day again and again. Instead, you're being the supportive adventurer and it gave me a whole new different perspective on the world. Besides the story, I think the dungeons and trials are spot on. They're challenging, visually impressive and immersive. The fight design is incredibly well designed. Overall, I think Dawntrail is a massive turnaround from the incredibly dull experience Endwalker's post-MSQ had.

76561198151602199,0,0,english,"Theres several things to know before getting into this expansion. We are just an Adventurer now, albeit a super strong world savior kind of adventurer. For that, just know that the warrior of light just may not be the main character of the expansion and we get to watch another's story come into fruition, but for the addition that our adventurer gets to visit an entirely new continent they've never been to. I found the story to be heartwarming at times and genuinely a nice good feelings adventure without a lot of the heartache we've grown to know in the past main stories. It is a fun expansion and very much more like an island vacation.For combat and the like, to my disappointment many things stayed the same or got easier. If you look around, its no mystery people are upset with this as well. Though there seems to be a promise of things getting better as we progress to things like Savage or Extreme trials so I'm not going to give up hope in the combat of this game. So far even the normal trials and some dungeon bosses have truly just made me think and thats something I can't say for most expansion bosses. I'm typically one shotting and maybe dying once every other new dungeon I clear. Partially due to my focus on the rotation of the new job Pictomancer, but also because I do think they put care to give us some more interesting mechanics.As far as I know, the two main concerns many people have in this story is the main story and how combat is. To my best ability to explain it, its alright. You're not going to be receiving a revolutionary expansion by any means, but you're not receiving a poor product. I have faith that this expansion will become something better as we continue along our journey as adventurers especially when we start seeing the savage and ultimate fights.",1719933188,3,0,positive

After endwalker and the huge stakes we've had the last bit, and with all the stress on us, it's refreshing to be able to sit back and experience the story from the role of a mentor and lead someone else into the beginning of their journey.I think it's a perfect way to keep the story alive, and not limit the game to simply being ""the warrior of light saves the world... Again."" On repeat. I personally love wuk lamat and find her to be one of the most compelling npcs thus far. If you're stuck on to wanting to be the main focus and only you, this expansion may not be for you, but for everyone else who loves the world and its character, you'll have a wonderful time. <3",1719932816,4,0,positive
76561198066076883,218846,73,english,"I've been waiting a hot minute to write this review, I've never done in indepth review like this before but I feel with all the mixed reviews complaining about weird things or that Wuk Lumat acts as the deuteragonist being a bad thing that I had to, and I wanted all the information I could before I could put it out, but I thought I would provide a review that covers 4 key aspects, Combat, Music, Environments and Story.[h3]Combat | Rating 9/10[/h3]The Combat of this Expansion is very enjoyable, SE really upped the quality of bosses and enemies this time round, making them not just a simple box of same rotating abilities with obvious wind ups like the other ones. However there is some flaws. [spoiler]The dungeons Origenics and Alexandria are 2 such examples, where they seem to close the player off from progression, forcing you to deal with enemies in smaller packs. Also who ever thought up the Origenics Automatoise as an enemy needs mental help, an unstunnable enemy with giant circle AOEs is not fun, but it only shows up once so I'll let it slide.... for now[/spoiler][h3]Music | Rating 9/10[/h3]The music here is **Chef's Kiss** Sublime, and I thought it was a treat, only two instances was it well..... I'll leave it behind spoilers [spoiler]The PeluPelu area had some of the most grating music in my opinion, so I will leave it at that, but also as much as I love Tuliyollal's Jazzy music, it made a couple scenes laughable cause as soon as a super serious cutscene finished, I got the hyped up jazz which made me piss myself laughing[/spoiler][h3]Environments | Rating 8/10[/h3]The first 3 areas, are as most reviews say [spoiler]Forests, but tbf, most areas in FFXIV could be seen as one environment, rather SE have decided to take focus on heritage and the people's backgrounds, styling there homes appropriately, I don't think people could expect these people to live in Volcanos like the Milalla or underwater like the Kojin. That's why SE had to focus on their homes than their surroundings as a whole. The three after that, are quite the spectacle's and I'm very happy with that, especially since it's a fucking COWBOY AREA! WOOOOOOOOOOO[/spoiler][h3]Story | Rating 5.5/10[/h3]Now this is sadly where the Expansion loses its charm, we did not expect going into this to be as good as Endwalker, maybe even Shadowbringers, but we had our hope. FFXIV players love these games for story, while others care more for gameplay, I care for both of these things, so seeing the story flop so hard is sad, I won't go much without spoiler tagging it though, just know this, if you only enjoy FFXIV for the story, maybe wait for the expansion to go on sale. [spoiler] Right, let's get down to this, yes the expansion is slow to start, 90-94 quests are slow as the game more focuses on world building, which I get, this is taking the same approach as ARR, focusing on trying to set us up for something bigger and an overall new adventure, and when we're revealed that new threat, I was very excited about it, in fact the story does move at what feels a faster pace, but this faster pace comes with a lot of plotholes, I will put these plot holes spoilered at the bottom, but those are by what I can remember. And some parts did feel like padding, where FFXIV expansions do have padding to learn how people live, this padding was way too much. And I won't dwell on this too much, but the end area, as emotional as it is, I didn't feel as much sympathy as I did for these Memories, I cared more for Krile and Erenville as they said farewell to constructs dear to them, but that's it, my main thing was why  we should do this if we're at risk of destroying the Source, I'm sorry, but lets focus on saving the world rather than socialize. And lastly, Wuk Lamat, I totally get people's opinions on having Wuk Lamat being a secondary Main Character, but come on, we knew that. I do wish we had more time with the other Ex-Scions, but I get why we didn't cause we've had ARR/HVW/SB/SHB/EW to get to know them, so I understand why this was the case, but I would prefer if more time was put into Bakool Ja Ja's Redemption or learn more about major side characters.[/spoiler][h3]Plot holes[/h3]Right, so there's a few major plot holes I don't understand how slipped by without being thought of how to answer:[list][*][spoiler]It is stated that the flow of time in the Dome flow's differently because of Reflection's different perceptions of time. So the problem is, the people of Yyasulani experienced 30 years while in the dome before we showed up, so doing some rough math, it took 2 days for us to repel Zoraal Ja's attack, upgrade the train and infiltrate the Dome, so if they experienced 15 years in a day.... The math goes way too weird, but it causes so many issues I feel need to be answered.[/spoiler][*][spoiler]Who is Gulool Ja's mother, and why did Zoraal Ja have a kid when he's made it clear he has no need to have a kid or want to either. Also How did he, they made it clear he's the only Mamool Ja in that realm, so how did he find another Mamool Ja to make one?[/spoiler][*][spoiler]So the Key Zoraal Ja opens the door to Sphene's realm, but why doesn't it take Zoraal Ja to Living Memory instead of Solution Nine, like maybe Sphene transported him to Solution Nine after, but she could only transport by memory, not body.[/spoiler][/list][h3]Hopes for Patch Content and Next Expansion[/h3]Some of these hopes are spoilers so I will spoiler them[list][*]Major one, please answer the plot holes above, they feel necessary to be answered[*][spoiler]Show a proper redemption of Bakool Ja Ja[/spoiler][*][spoiler]Reunite the Scions against the upcoming threat, I'm sure the next expansion can't be as chill as before (We have no known new threat, but I'd like to see us all back together), so I hope we can get the gang back together, maybe with some [/spoiler][*][spoiler]Now that Erenvile has the hopes of living on his Mother's hopes to travel the world, I hope he can join the main group, I know he wasn't taught in combat, but it's my hope for the patch content that he starts trying to learn, picking up the bow just like his mother used to[/spoiler][/list]",1719932762,1,0,positive

Not only the story is an amazing refresh from 'world end class danger' to 'lets go to an adventure' (that we have since shadowbringers), but also dungeons/trials has mechanical stakes now (just read the info message on middle of screen / look at arena and you will solve all of it, but if you fail they are finally doing some damage).My only two complain are: > the scions still appears too much (but since they also sell some volume it was predicted that they would show up), I just wished they showed up a little less and instead give us new characters / new group. > While the new bosses designs are fun, I still dont like the 2min meta / homogenisation of jobs on same roleBesides those two complains, everything else felt fresh and its indicates that the post expansion content will be fun to play.To people complaining about MSQ: We finally got an adventure that we were missing since Heavensward (the award winning expansion that we use to sell to new players). If you are complaining because 'my favourite scion didn't had the deserved screen time' or 'the story is not focused around my character' welp too bad, but we already had the last  2 or even 3 expansions like that so its refreshing to just experiment new stuff and get along with it.To people complaining about difficulty / battle content: this is a video-game, if even with trust system you are not able to complete a dungeon/trial maybe then you should learn how to play the game (?) or instead just ask for a friend to carry you (?) or even maybe just watch the msq online instead. The thing is, the vast majority of Endwalker patches after the base expansion release was... boring to say at least. You were barely punished for any mistakes and there were barely any new mechanics to learn. Now if you are one of those players that doesn't like video-game or use ffxiv just like a forum (chat all day and don't actually do battle/crafter/gather content), then just wait a month until the raid gear is here and the other players will carry you through the MSQ.",1719926281,3,0,positive

76561198105386748,111016,2304,english,"Dawntrail is more Final Fantasy 14. Has the same pros and cons as before for anyone coming back. Story dials it back a lil bit like it should, while mechanics for group fights are way more interesting this go around. The expansion is worth it if you know you like 14 already and can deal with the same quirks. More details below but so far it's been great. I wouldn't say Shadowbringers/Endwalker level but the game has to have a soft reset at some point.For people that want more information.Story: It's a great overall story, but does still have the FF14 problem of a lot of teleport, talk, teleport, talk. One of the new characters also takes a lot of the protagonist spot light and I see a lot of complains about that, but I like playing mentor. Besides that its still your Final Fantasy grand adventure.Group Content: The biggest change I've noticed so far is group activities feel far more fun. Granted its still new, but boss mechanics are a lot more interesting. New markers, game has more ways to help you deal with mechanics so it can give you new stuff basically. It's by far feels like this expansion might be gearing to be more game play rather than story oriented. I fell in love with the trails, can't wait for savage.New Jobs: Viper and Pictomancer are both fun, but not revolutionary. Viper is great for people that want a fast but easier end class. Picto is harder since you need to plan around your abilities and store your spells basically on canvasses. Both don't feel bad to play.Job Changes: I've not messed with all the class changes but Astro rework feels great. Sage's new abilities are also sorta what we always wanted. More damage buttons (I think all healers got new damage abilities?) and an AOE Kardia buff that is really fun to use if you like playing Green DPS like me. Zones: Zones are still stunning. You can still expect the same quality in visual appeal to the past two expansions.Post Game: So far endgame is the same? I've not researched if there is any changes but tomestones are still a thing. Extreme trails still drops weapons and accessories. Crafting feels like there is a lot more gear but I'm only like level 92 on my crafters so. All the stuff you expect is there for expansion release.

They've promised more content than any other expansion as well. Excited for the future of the game.",1719920361,0,0,positive
76561198098611646,245192,14000,english,Very cute expansion. A good start for a new story. People are expecting Shadowbringers and Endwalker level of writing. While yes we could've had that. I am rather happy we went for a more uplifting but somber tone this time around and especially excited to see more of the story given the implications of the ending of Dawntrail.Also Wuk Lamat is a fine character.

76561198407396857,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is a beginning. The beginning of a new adventure. Yes, there are times where it's fetch quest heavy, but you're playing a JRPGMMO, which has always been and will always be fetch quest heavy. There will be times where what you are doing feels asinine and redundant, but sometimes to understand the world, you must explore. Wuk Lamat is a character that I relate to on a very personal level. Trying to hide her flaws and weakness behind bravado is very familiar territory and I think a lot of people who play this (and leave negative reviews with no real constructive feedback) miss the opportunity to see what she is: real. She's not infallible, she doesn't have all the answers, but she tries to see the best in everyone, and will do anything to make sure that her dream is realised, but while walking beside her family, friends and people. She is what a ruler should be: brave, determined and kind. Yes, this game gets political, but the game has politics in every expansion:- ARR had the Garleans vs Eorzea. - Heavensward had the Church vs State arguments.- Stormblood is an all-out war.- Shadowbringers has the Crystarium vs Eulmore.- Endwalker is basically the Scions vs Sharlayan and then the invasion of Garlemald (even for the sake of peace). We have always had politics in this game, and when people were hyped for Dawntrail, did they miss the fact that the 6.55 quest have Wuk Lamat tell you that she is vying for the throne?!The game has it's flaws, much like all of us, but if you give it a chance and look to the deeper messages that are sprinkled through the story, there is so much rich depth in this, the zones are beautiful and colourful, the characters are inventive and funny, and the dialogue and growth is so warming. Be patient, this game ages like fine wine, and personally, I'm so excited to see where we go next!",1719919856,0,0,positive
76561198023352806,186174,172,english,"(Spoiler free) I would recommend this even for veterans of the game. Viper and Pictomancer are fun jobs, as normal for  XIV. However, one should come in with the right expectations. This isn't going to be another Endwalker, or Shadowbringers. In the words of a certain villain turned ally, the Final Curtain Fell on that play. Now the curtain rises on a new one, with new parts for all to play. Yoshi-P when putting this together understood the stakes couldn't keep rising, there needed to be a soft reset. So the new play needs some world and character building. The Warrior of Light/Adventurer is not the singular focus this time, as the WoL transitions to a mentor capacity in teaching others how they can help others, while still getting to do what they do best. Solve problems.That said, the expansion does have issues. Many scenes felt like they should've been voice acted, but for some reason weren't (In the English version at least) and I feel like parts of the story could've used a different perspective. The lower stakes story will feel slow to many also, especially after the mile a minute pace that endwalker had. Something I think some more Adventurer focused moments could've helped counterbalance. A lot of the quests see certain NPC's off on their own while we as players are more or less Idle in a cut scene. I think a lot of the side quests carry the load of the adventure aspect. The sheer size of some places leads to optimization issues that caused frame rate lag, even on a higher end system. While this could also be from sheer population, it is likely related to the huge graphical update.All in all, fun expansion, if you're coming in with the right expectations. It's okay to dislike this one, and I get why many do. But at the end of the day, it's enjoyable even with the issues. I'd give it a solid 7/10.

She still has more depth than the edgy two-note cardboard-cutout Dark Knights hanging around Limsa all day, and with endlessly more heart than them as well. Her character archetype is hit-or-miss, but for me, it hit.Was it a great story? Probably not. Did this have 9+ years of build-up and foreshadowing? Of course not, we wrapped all that shit up with a tidy bow back in EW. Just like ARR, this is a serviceable groundwork to lay some new rules and establish a new status quo. Moreover, the actual themes in this expansion resonated with me, much like the ones in EW did - themes of 'family' are always going to be pretty rocky, especially since no two families are alike. For me, though? It hit close. Expectations, both meeting them and casting them aside, sibling love and sibling rivalry, parental love and negligence, and all the different forms those can take: I think DT handled it pretty well. Mind you, I'm a sappy sod, so anything with even a hint of genuine emotion and heart behind it can probably get me emotionally invested.Above all, though, I went into this expecting a summer vacation arc with little-to-no stakes, and came out pleasantly surprised that it was both that *and* an engaging appetizer for what we had to expect going forward in a post-EW FFXIV where our old plotlines were wrapped up and new ones have begun to dangle.

It's a new beginning and a new story - one of personal growth, discovery and inclusion.You have been tasked with aiding a prospective ruler of a nation and helping her with a rite of succession. She will be competing against her siblings and other contenders for the throne. Your enjoyment of the expansion will likely hinge on how much you like this new character you will be aiding - Wuk Lamat as she learns about the natives and cultures of her homeland. She's naive, impulsive and brash. She also is idealistic to a fault and wants to preserve what her father has established. She's seen as polarising within the community, but I liked her. She's with you through the whole expansion. Some may not like how exposition heavy this expansion is. (it is very exposition heavy and somewhat fatiguing at times), but the characters you meet along the way are endearing.About half way through the main scenario quest, the stakes are raised. This is when I started to enjoy the story more. In typical Final Fantasy style, there are some heavy themes to explore including legacy, memory and the afterlife. It reminded me of a Black Mirror episode with some of the themes it explored.Ultimately, while I enjoyed the story, the ending felt a bit rushed and unsatisfying.However, I do recommend this expansion for those who have played the other expansions.",1719912610,1,0,positive

Ich bewerte hier aber nicht nur die Story sondern auch den Inhalt um den es dann geht. Und was hier in den Inis schon abverlangt wird ist um einiges fordernder als noch zu Endwalker Zeiten. Bei manchen Zwischen - Bossen bin ich mehrmals gewiped weil die Mechaniken recht schnell und vielfach wirken und man recht viel in Bewegung sein muss. Gefällt mir gut und macht enorm viel Spaß. Ansonsten verhält es sich so wie bei allen anderen Add Ons auch, ich bin froh das die Linie weiter durchgezogen wird und somit auch immer wieder die unteren Lvl Bereiche bestehen bleiben.

É como se a Wuk Lamat fosse a real protagonista da história e nós, junto dos Scions (equipe que literalmente salvou o universo) fôssemos coadjuvantes integrantes de um partido político que serve pra alavancá-la ao poder. Isso é algo aceitável na primeira metade da história visto a trama envolver o rito de sucessão, porém a segunda metade (após esse arco ser finalizado) permanece com a forçação de barra em que essa personagem precisa estar ali o tempo todo, tomando todas as decisões e ofuscando completamente o que deveria se tratar de um momento da nossa personagem explorando o restante do continente com o personagem Erenville (que convenhamos só se ferrou nessa história inteira, nunca vi um personagem se foder tanto dentro de qualquer arco em FFXIV). De todos os mapas novos, o último mapa foi MUITO TEDIOSO, literalmente o Erenville se fodendo psicologicamente e a Wuk Lamat querendo fazer um tour e torrando minha paciência até eu simplesmente cogitar desgostar da personagem que tanto me cativou no primeiro arco.

I play the game with Japanese voices like the weeb I am so I cannot comment on Wuk Lamat's English VA. I'll start with cons and move onto pros:Cons: - The story feels all over the place. Some sections are amazing, some others not so much. I'm willing to give it a pass because I thought the final zone was fantastic and worth the ride, but not all characters land.- Filler. Some sections feel artificially long and I frankly don't know why they made that decision. The expansion could have used some trimming here and there. - A specific cutscene in the last trial that REALLY didn't land for me. Neutral:- Wuk Lamat. Personally, I enjoyed her character arc, and I liked her Japanese VA, so it was a good experience for me overall; however, if the main character of the expansion doesn't land for you, then you will have a bad time. Pros: - Dungeons and trials are some of the best the game has ever had. They are very varied in mechanics, themes, style, and the difficulty also feels nice. Here's to hoping they don't nerf them. - The graphics update is amazing. Almost everything looks way better now, I've been revisiting older content just to see the improvements. - Most of the new zones are beautiful, the last one most notably. - I've liked the additions to the classes I play. This is subjective, of course, but I've had fun with my preferred jobs and roles. - The last zone of the base DLC is seriously some of my favorite content in the whole game, up there with the best from ShB and EW, not only aesthetically, but they made some really bold gameplay choices that make your character's decisions feel impactful. Really improved my opinion of the expansion. I think the decision fo making the WoL a mentor for this expansion was going to be a divisive one no matter what, but it was handled well for the most part IMO, so I'll give them kudos for that. I never thought that my character was deprived of agency for what it's worth.For me, Dawntrail is tied with Stormblood as the ""worst"" FFXIV expansion as they both have similar defects and qualities, but I don't think that makes it a bad DLC. I recommend it overall. The FFXIV community seriously needs to understand that something can be good without being the absolute best, and that something can be flawed without being dogwater.",1719904162,2,0,positive

The trials and dungeons in this expansion have been some of my favorites ever. The graphical update did wonders for my immersion and the extra dye slot is phenomenal.  My only real complaints are 1. Not enough y'shtola or estinien. Need more of them, best characters out of the scions by far.2. So many of the long boring fetch quests could have just been extended cut scenes. Ive saved multiple planets at this point, why am I delivering Ice cream as a quest and not a cut scene?Bonus:3. this isnt really a complaint of dawntrail but ff14 as a whole. these cutscene animations for player characters gotta start catching up with the times. Theyre so stiff, like I get they cant do too much because of size differences but dang dude, some of these animations have been used on repeat since ARR. So tired of seeing my character wave their arms around and point to show theyre talking.Still keeping my rating of 8.7/10",1719902218,2,0,positive

I see a lot of people don't like that we aren't really the main character, but tbh I like the change of pace. Though speaking of pace, the pacing of the expansion up until the end of the first major plot point is abysmal. The pacing holds the expansion back from being great, it is definitely the weakest expansion. The first two zones were literally putting me to sleep. Anyway, onto the good in the expansion. The story being told is again one of the weakest, it's good, but it is also building up for the next saga, so of course it has to mainly be build up in similar respects to ARR. The story being the weakest doesn't mean its bad by any means, I really enjoyed the story being told, following Wuk Lamat on her journey to become dawnservant. Wuk Lamat is definitely the highlight of the expansion, she is Lyse but actually good. I find myself actually watching cutscenes with her in them as opposed to skipping a cutscene everytime Lyse appeared during Stormblood. Lastly the new zones are 10/10, they are probably the best aspect of the expansion.I give the expansion 7 Hrothgar mommies out of 10",1719901254,0,0,positive

The best way to look at it is, the things that matter for the 2+ years will have to live with them are great, and the thing we only have to do once is, uh, well you only have to do it once.Pros -- Somehow even better music then Endwalker.- the best zone vibes in years.- Difficulty making a much welcome return, forcing players to actually learn to play the game.- Some of the best Battle content ever added to the game.- Graphics update looks good when all the elements are blended together, much better than advertised in any promo material.- Final Fantasy TexasCons -- The weakest story ever told in a FFXIV Expansion. They had an amazing plot set up to work with and it's annoying to see the story we got out of it. For a game that basically sells as a single player MMO, it's really bad when that part doesn't land.- Some of the worst voice acting the game has seen in awhile. It's not any of the actors fault they just should have never been put in the position they were.Overall, despite coming in around the bottom of all the XIV expansion in quality, they have an opportunity to fix the writing issues moving forward, as well as continue to add more amazing content in the other areas of the game (battle, Crafting, Zones, Ect.)

76561198153093793,0,0,english,"Most of people's problems with this expansion stem from 3 things: WoL taking a backseat, Wuk Lamat's characterization, and the story overall.1. WoL taking a backseatWelcome to the vacation arc folks, we're back to normal adventurer stuff. We're along for the ride again, and that's ok. It's gotta be a huge weight off of the WoL's shoulders not to be the tip of the sword for once. I feel like, in a narrative sense, I can actually take the time to work on side content. Yeah, in Endwalker I knew that the story would be waiting for me if I took a break, but the lack of a sense of urgency is lovely.2. Wuk LamatIf your main problem is that the person who literally hired you to help her out is taking up a lot of screen time, that's kind of on you for not tempering your expectations accordingly. We've never been to this continent before, she's a native with a lot of investment in what we're doing. Of course she's gonna be front and center. Showing us around, taking charge of quests, and talking a lot. Do y'all remember ARR Cid? Round 2. Regarding her characteristics, think of her position and how she was raised. It's only logical that she is how she is. Having finished the expansion, she's honestly become an excellent character, one who I can't wait to work alongside in future expansions(crossing my fingers). 3. The story itselfI've already covered the WoL's position in the story, so I'll now tackle the story itself. To sum up: Ishikawa and Oda are gone. This is a brand new team, writing a brand new story. Yeah it's not with a new cast of characters, but comics have been doing this for decades. If you don't like their writing, I'm sorry that their writing style isn't as palatable to you. Lastly, to those of you who are seeing ""Mixed"" [as of 1 AM on 7/2] and are worried, or being convinced not to play it. Remember that the only people who have time to write reviews are the ones who stopped playing the expansion, and that someone with a negative opinion is more likely to make a review. Their opinions are as valid as the positive, but as of right now they're louder and they're not busy still playing the expansion.",1719899731,1,0,positive

I think the twist in bakool ja ja's storyline is really when the expansion became more interesting. it's just a shame it took so long to get there. as for sphene, her motivations were also clear from the beginning, she cares most about her subjects, and the way their culture evolved turned sinister, the only way to sustain their current lifestyles was to kill others. I truly believe the alexandrian lore is one of the most interesting civilizations the devs have created.

76561198073623593,106259,3018,english,"Too much of the hate for this game's expansion is over the characters, which I think are fine. It's also been complained about the pacing, which, again, is fine. Wuk Lamat is constantly referred to as annoying, but I don't see an issue with her. You see her learn and develop over the course of the xpac, which is the point of her character. She also rambles on a LOT about ""loving her people"" because she stands in such stark contrast to the characters she's having to fight against. The story isn't meant to be about US, unlike previous expansions. The story is about helping a character who isn't used to these kinds of things to grow into their own, which is why, so far, every character has been great (mostly). I get Wuk saying ""FOR MY PEOPLE!"" annoys some, but it's there for a reason, and it shows she's sticking to her Resolve, no matter how bad things get. She's not giving up who she is as a person. As for pacing, I think people were putting way too high of expectations on this expansion after a wrap-up of a TEN YEAR OLD STORY. This is the new ARR starting point for future stories. It's going to be different and a bit rough around the edges as the writing team now have to come up with new ways to pivot and expand on what we know. No more Ascians. No more Hydalin or Zodiark. This is new ground we are treading, and I think the team is doing a great job.Expansion is great so far. Content is solid, VA work is really good, story is rough around the edges but picks up and ends on an amazing note (no spoilers!), and the QOL and improvements this xpac are just as good or better than last xpac.Haters gonna hate, but not understand this ISN'T Shadowbringers or Endwalker.

Wuk Lamat was insecure, yes, and when she found her strength she would chew your ear off with that, too. But I'd rather see an insecure person not realizing her strong suits grow than Lyse's seemingly endless trip of self pity. I could have done with some less repetition in dialogue, too. I'm totally fine however with the story. It was supposed to be light-hearted compared to Endwalker. I never expected it to be as complex as it's predecessor. How could it be? It's just ONE expansion, the foundation of a new story and boy, was the story of the base game boring compared to Dawntrail! I just enjoyed to have flashbacks to all that memories and be right with my theories all the time. Summer vacation. I honestly was surprised that this DLC's story had some pretty dark tones at all.Also, many don't like how jobs and roles are handled. As someone who came to hate WoW because they tried hard for betterment and changed everything until barely recognizable I really appreciate the stability of the FF14 core system. There might be some code history issues beneath that. Since you can play every job with the same character in FF14 I totally agree that the differences between jobs should have been kept in place. In other games where you only can play one class per character I always hated these restrictions because they lock you out from aspects of the game and force you to play alts if you want to see them.Well, with expectations that high after Endwalker I'm not suprised about a mixed rating.

I'll update it later if needed when more patches are released.I absolutely adore FFXIV and have been playing for a while. The graphics improvements are stunning, and they really made a huge difference! I've watched all the cutscenes and followed the whole story so far. Shadowbringers and Endwalker expansions are my absolute favorites!Dawntrail has the most beautiful towns! I love the open world, full of details—the lighting during sunrise, the forests, and all the gorgeous environments. Solution Nine is super futuristic and detailed; I love it! I wish we had an INN in the apartment area; it looks so cool. The music is also fantastic!They've improved the combat mechanics in dungeons and trials, which I love. The extreme trials look like so much fun!The story starts very slowly, with almost no combat, just following the protagonist (she's a bit silly and annoying) around. It gets a bit better, but at the end, it felt like I was doing side quests and not the main story. Many cutscenes weren't dubbed, and I know many people skip the non-dubbed ones, but you'll miss lots of important explanatory parts.If you don't care about story and just skip all cutscenes, it will take some time to get to the dungeons and find real combat.I haven't tried the new classes yet (Viper and Pictomancer), but I will soon!",1719886392,1,0,positive

It's hard going from the apocalypse of Endwalker to anything that's not on level with it. That being said, the music is phenomenal, the dungeons and trials are probably my favorite set of launch content in an FF14 expansion (barring one single boss that could use a tune-up in the ex roulette tier of dungeons), and I enjoyed the story for what it was.Wuk Lamat really is similar to Lyse, but I think they learned from SB because she grew on me significantly more than Lyse ever managed to. If you're here for gameplay, you're probably going to enjoy what they're bringing to the table after their commitment to go less easy on us. If you're here for story, there's a good chance you'll leave happy or you'll leave upset until the patch quests roll out.On a final note, the launch was a technical success in my opinion - several days in and I've only been booted one single time and have had at worst 30 min queues, at best instant queues when not trying to get on at peak evening hours.

I main DRK and the minor tweaks to the job has made things far more flowy. Im also super eager to try VIP. The story has been quite fun up to this point with plenty of unexpected twists. Ive seen people complaining its slower but honestly its pace is no different than any before endwalker, which I feel gave people a misconception of things. Endwalker was designed to be feature complete whereas every other expansion has always been designed to complete a story whereas patch content rounflds everything out to set up for the next.Overall, Im quite enjoying gameplay with genuinely challenging fights and dungeons, and the story has been quite good fun",1719883427,0,1,positive

Final Fantasy 14 has always been about the story, and this is just the beginning of a new overall direction. And several feel enstranged because we aren't the center of attention/main focus of the story....that is very realistic though...in real life we aren't the main character in every situation.

76561198066234065,0,0,english,"People complaining are acting like FFXIV hasn't always had a slower MSQ. I played all of the MSQ again to get ready for Dawntrail. It's always been this slow. Take your time with it. The job changes are all really solid. There hasn't been a change where I've questioned what they were thinking. (I do miss Spineshatter Dive though 3:) If you're unaware of the Black Mages, there were individuals relying on plugins (which are against TOS anyway) to make an alternative playstyle. No one should be surprised this was changed.The new areas are gorgeous, and the side-content as usual is really great.My main complaint with the MSQ, especially early on is how it feels the need to re-iterate things that it just showed you. It never overstays its welcome though, it can be grating though. The dungeons are super fun, and Viper and Pictomancer are also super interesting new jobs.Wuk Lamat is also no where near as bad as people are saying. This is a lot more low stakes of a story, and this is less Lyse 2.0, and more, ""Showing a homebody princess that she doesn't know anything about her country."" It's really interesting when you're looking at it from this angle. We already know Wuk Lamat is gonna win. Peace is her main M.O. This isn't going to change. What is going to change, and does change is why she wants this. It goes from, ""Well, my dad wants peace, so I want peace."" to ""I love this country, and my people, and I want them to be safe.""It's definitely more simple, and a bit slower than past expansions, but bearing in mind how slow Heavensward and Stormblood were, I don't mind it at all. People are definitely rushing through and not taking time to really engage with it, which I think is super important to do with these games. This isn't a story to rush, much like the rest of FFXIV, it's a game to  take your time with. It's worth it. Not even to mention that it's more FFXIV. I happen to love FFXIV, and I'm pretty happy to have more of it.People got their expectations way too high after Endwalker.

Wuk Lamat is your typical Anime spunky-young-upstart protagonist who doesn't know how much she doesn't know but resolves to overcome her challenges with the Power of Friendship™! She is likable enough and I found myself enjoying her growth more-so than I did with Lyse. Sidequests have some wonderful characters and story lines and give you a chance to break up the longer stretches of walking and talking in the MSQ while learning about this new continent and the zones are absolutely beautiful to explore thanks to the upgraded graphics engine.

Bien joué, le clip d'intro ne m'a pas du tout préparée au chaos émotionnel qui s'ensuivrait. La vache, ils ont réussi à m'envoyer des grains de sable dans les yeux, les scénaristes. J'ai esquivé, résisté, mais ils ont fini par m'atteindre ><.Il s'agit vraiment d'un nouveau départ, et au lieu de tomber dans l'erreur gravissime de type Dragon Ball Z ou WoW (un boss final toujours plus absurdement fort, mais si en fait ce grand méchant là, il avait un chef, qui était manipulé par untel, lui-même sous-fifre de machin...), attirer la lumière sur un nouveau théâtre d'événements est habile. Niveau lore et émotions, je place déjà cet opus en deuxième position, japs si loin derrière Shadowbringers. J'ai noté des inspirations qui me semblent faire écho à XIII et Type-0, tout en restant cohérents avec l'univers propre à XIV.

Des chara-design de boss très soignés. Enfin, l'ambiance musicale est toujours au top.Ok, j'ai été (très, grandement, beaucoup !) déçue par un point : toujours pas de mappage/regroupement de combos personnalisables pour la configuration manette, ce qui rend notamment les dernières classes sorties injouables (et R.I.P. mon espoir de jouer à nouveau le paladin ou le ninja en PvE). Deux croix on vous dit, il y a deux croix, ont veut pas finir un combo sur la deuxième parce qu'il y a déjà trop d'attaques sur la première, merci ! Et oui, il y a aussi des joueurs manette qui recherchent l'optimisation sans vouloir se casser le dos sur un clavier non ergonomique x)Ah oui, et adieu mon dash préféré :'( La coupe plongeante était si stylée...

The dungeon and trial encounters are peak and they have me excited for raiding, which is how I'm going to be spending the next two-ish years with this game anyway. Regarding the criticisms, I think it's just a misstep of marketing. We were told we'd be doing more low-stakes adventuring, so it actually passed the relatively low expectations I had for the MSQ story (FF9 is also my favorite FF, so all the nods to the classic, subtle and overt, scored some freebie points from me). But I don't recall in the leadup to Dawntrail that we'd be essentially cast as the badass sidekick to Wuk Lamat for this go-around, and the most recent patch that introduced WL didn't really indicate that she'd be featured so heavily. Again, for me personally, I didn't really care. But I guess I thought we'd be doing more Indiana Jones style stuff, instead of being the XIV adventurer equivalent of Obi-Wan Kenobi.",1719863128,0,0,positive

(keine Sorge, nach meiner Rezession dürft ihr weiterjammern)Die Story ist klar etwas eintönig, aber sie ist sehr gut geschrieben, die Dialoge sind gut umgesetzt und seltenst findet man ein Spiel, dass so sehr Wert auf die Charaktere legt wie FF14.Zum Thema, dass die Erweiterung nicht so spannend ist wie SB oder EW: klar ist nach dem ganzen Weltretten wieder etwas Pause dazwischen. Es muss ja nicht jeden Tag die Welt untergehen. Es hieß, dass mit Dawntrail eine neue Geschichte vorbereitet werden soll die uns wieder viele Jahre beschäftigt und jede Geschichte beginnt mit einer Einleitung und steigert sich dann zum Höhepunkt (Gleich zum Schluss zu kommen wäre ja langweilig oder).also wartet ab, lasst euch auf die neue Geschichte ein wie ein guter Film und spielt einfach das Spiel so wie alle anderen auch.Technisch gesehen ist das Spiel absolut perfekt umgesetzt, es gab keine Warteschlangen auf den Servern durch extrem gute Planung und vor allem, was heute sehr sehr selten ist bei Spieleentwicklern: man hat aus den Fehlern beim Start von EW gelernt.Wer sich beschweren möchte, dass ich mit meinen fast 6k Spielstunden ja keine Ahnung habe darf sich gerne ingame bei mir melden oder einen Kommentar verfassen.Allen anderen Wünsche ich viel Spaß und unterhaltsame Spielstunden in der neuen Erweiterung DawntrailLiebe GrüßeNaijura Auria (Raiden)",1719862944,30,1,positive

76561198125259992,0,0,english,"Okay so I wanted to write a review which I often won't do for this game as I've been playing it since the beginning. But with this new expansion I feel that I want to share what I felt during it and hope that others who are thinking about getting the expansion will read this as well and understand what I mean. So starting off I see a lot of people saying this started really slow now maybe it's because I rushed right in and I was ready and I had everything prepared. But this felt like it was a nice study pace and I think that's what a lot of people are not used to. If we're going to the prior expansion It was very fast-paced It was very much action everywhere and this one did to that eventually but this felt more like a telling of a story rather than an action pack RPG. And I'm okay with that, this was more relaxing and where you start out at it makes sense everything is fairly straightforward. We're going to have a main character who will be helping like in all of the expansions and we will go through a journey of growth with this character as we see in the other expansions. So yes while many people will say this is slow or it's just not the same it's not meant to be the same. So take that with a grain of salt if you are planning on buying this because yes there is a slowness to the storyline but in reality it's just a simplicity and a overall relaxing vibe to it during the first half of this expansion. We are literally doing something for our player to enjoy You know we are working with someone else This is more for our benefit without the whole the world is ending type of situation. And that's all I will say on that to not give too many spoilers. Second is the new dungeons and raids and I have to say they have really outdone theirselves I totally play with NPCs the first time around when doing a dungeon or a raid if possible. And I do that for mainly two reasons. One you learn all the mechanics anyone who really has a hard time with that remember if you play with the NPCs you can see where to go and learn the patterns of your enemies far more easier. The second reason is because I want to see what the MP seeds would say in these situations they have unique dialogues for each dungeon or boss they are fighting so it's very cool to see that if you want to get more background on the characters. And this did not disappoint with this expansion, while the new main character that we will be playing with can be highly annoying with their gullible behavior it's because we are meant to see a big change as we progress the story and we do see that to the point that you feel oddly proud of the character if you will as you progress. But to hear the dialogue and to see how they interacted and I'm talking about every month you you will go into these dungeons with if you choose to play with the NPCs does add a bit more touch to it. So the new dungeons mechanics are way harder and honestly I think you will be able to do extreme to afterwards because you have to be fast paced they ramped it up like they wanted to and you can tell. A lot of people commented on that and I believe they are right It feels much more punishing when you mess up in the reaction time has to be fast on your end if you're going to keep up. So ask for the story and the gameplay I'm honestly giving it a 9 out of 10. I have my own gripes with the company and the way they do certain aspects of this game so I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a fanboy because honestly they can improve on a lot of different names when it comes to how they present stuff. But as far as the expansion itself goes I would say give it a try maybe not buy the collector if you're really trying to give it a try remember you can get refunds if you buy through here I believe. But I would definitely tell you to try the new areas there's a whole bunch of stuff to do The new weapons are nice, and if anything even if you feel a certain way about the story then new content that was added is pretty fun. You'll have to try it for yourself maybe go watch some YouTube videos if you don't mind spoilers to see this is something you really want to do but for me it was worth the money. As I said I didn't buy the collector's edition I just bought the normal one.",1719858969,0,0,positive
76561198282877836,0,0,english,"The MSQ was tediously slow at times, the writing is also a bit off with characters constantly talking about their feelings every two cutscenes. It's fine to have emotional moments, but 80% of cutscenes were about that instead of things that would actually progress the story: I'd prefer showing over telling. This was a problem in 6.x patches too, and compared to previous expansions, character development is a bit off.The story itself without all the fuss was actually good and I enjoyed it. The villain(s) were nothing special, and even though they fall flat compared to ShB/EW, they had their moments. There are also a few interesting side characters which I hope we see more of in the future.What this expansion really excels at is environment and encounter design. All six zones are stunning, even better than Shadowbringers', with the 2nd social hub being especially impressive. The graphics update may look subtle, but it does a lot more than people realize. Dungeons are much, much, much better compared to Endwalker ones and a tad more difficult, I don't fall asleep during roulettes anymore as they keep me much more engaged.If you only play for the MSQ, you might not like Dawntrail that much.

76561198029587508,0,0,english,"It feels like a lot of the other players are kind of missing the point. First, this is the opening act in a new narrative, in what is, for all intents and purposes, a new world. For us to understand where the developing team is going, our journey necessitates us learning about the new land and the peoples of the new land we're in. We've spent the past ten years in Eorzea, and now we're in Tural. Our journey accompanying young Wuk Lamat is one where roles have been reversed, and I say in a masterful way. Where in ARR we were surrounded by mentor figures trying to bring out the best of us, we have become the mentor figure trying to bring out the best in another. This is Wuk Lamat's story, and the foundation block on which so much more may ultimately be built. Our role is one whereupon our characters, having time and time again needed to push through, rise to a new challenge, face a new threat, save the world... are stepping back from that threshold, and in a position to actually enjoy the place they're in, the people they're with, and the world that is opening up before them. It is a shame that so many people find themselves unable to enjoy this. I have enjoyed every moment of the story so far, have, for only the second time in my playing not left a single zone without doing every quest there out of a sheer want to learn more about the area, the people, the place... and done so hungry for more.Look to those who walked before to lead those who walk after.",1719857445,93,8,positive

76561198031607042,0,0,english,"Do you remember playing through ARR story? It had a completely different pace compared to the expansions following it.That's what you'll get with Dawntrail. It's a bit of a shocking reset in pacing, which is what has led almost entirely to negative reviews for the expansion so far. To be honest, it is slow. Quite slow. It attaches you to completely new characters that you had otherwise not known, especially the main character. There is a substantial amount of buildup action taking place. Square wants you to like the main character and become attached to them, as well as find interest in the new continent, the people and the supporting characters. But let's be honest - this is the trampoline for another massive story arc. When I first started playing FFXIV, it was in the middle of Shadowbringers. The ARR story was soooo slow and I decided to buy a story skip. I regret doing that so much! I ended up watching summaries on YouTube about what happened in the story, but of course there are still things I missed. If I could, I would go back and get through the ARR story, despite it being slow at times. At first I was bored of the primary characters - and yet, years later, I love these characters. I came to understand the depth to them that exists and which can only be explored over a much longer period of time.Dawntrail is a reset to FFXIV in much the same way that ARR was a reset. It's a big shift. It's asking for your investment and patience with the story as it tries to start fresh.Excellent development of characters takes time. Go into the expansion with the mindset of this being a brand new game with a new story and characters you don't yet know well enough to know if you like them. If you adopt this mindset and believe that the end of this story's line will be anything close to the end of the last one, you'll enjoy Dawntrail.Square pulled off a redefinition of what an MMO story can be, culminating in one of the greatest endings to any story I've personally ever read or watched.

But I think what determines if you enjoy it is the kinda gamer you are.90% of the complaints are that the expansion is slow or it takes too long to unlock a dungeon or its people who just started the early access, unlocked the first dungeon or two and think its not challenging enough.If you're on this page, I'm going to assume you've played the previous expansions, and we all know that EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. spends the time to layup the story and starts 'slow'. I put that in quotes because frankly I don't think that's a fair criticism. To whine that it takes you too long to get to a dungeon is frankly, ridiculous. The expansion isn't here just to give you handful more fights to do, else they would have just added that on anyway like they always do. The expansion is to *expand* the game universe and give you a story and a *reason* to do the fights.Yes, the cutscense feel quite movie-like but I'd rather that than some rushed, half-thought-out, sloppy mess of a story that's barreled through and has no real purpose. So many games have made the mistake of not letting you see enough background or get to know the characters and then expecting you to suddenly care about them and battle alongside them - so why do we suddenly complain when a game does let you get invested? 'I didn't buy this just to skip through the dialogue' - then why are you here? I, for one, enjoy that I am getting my moneys-worth out of the expansion. I get a rich experience that builds on something existing that I am passionate about yay! If you have a tik tok short ahh attention span, I can't help you. You're probably the type to watch anime dubbed anyway.The first two dungeons aren't super challenging, but I still had MULTIPLE randos dying to the mechanics, so evidently its challenging enough for the casual players and frankly, to make super hard content at the beginning of an expansion will alienate a large number of players anyway. Once you get past the first two, the first trial and 3rd dungeon ramp up a bit and it keeps you on your toes and that's what I enjoy. Not everyone wants perma difficult gameplay, there are still semi-casual players about and I don't think they should be excluded. We always get harder content in the end anyway so everyone is happy.Overall, I've enjoyed the expansion - as always there's the running here and there on errands which can be a bit zzzz but the story is rich and the character exploration is great - with each new character having their own issues and resolutions etc - and so far the content is hitting. If you're here for the story - get the expansion. If you're here for just fighting - maybe wait a bit and get it on sale or wait till you can skip",1719854526,14,2,positive

Gameplay itself has been what you would expect outside of dungeons and trials, and exceptional in them. Overall I'm enjoying myself. It's not ShB or EW but it was never going to be.

I challenge you this, look at all the bad reviews and tell which genuinely has detailed descriptions on why it was the worst expansion.

It is notably less big megaverses shifting and saving every metaverse from every millimillion mindGod that is threatening it, to something that is about some characters and their journey. I have loved it so far probably because of that. My experience of class changes so far are with black mage, and I love it. It doesn't change the class, it just makes me use what is important when it is important. Sharpcast is useless when it can be a part of an ability all the time. I kind of feel that's what this expansion is doing. Making things better for the vast majority of the players, including making it a game more people can play more happily.Only negatives I've heard in game is from a really snappy, crabby, dude who annoys everyone with how he hates every change in the game (and has hated every change in the game before launch). Kind of feel the line in the game where it says, ""No one cares what you think,"" applies there because I don't think he can enjoy anything in his life, and just wants others to pat him on the head and listen to him whine.Oh right, this is a review of this game not that guy I hope quits the game because I can't stand his voice anymore.

Yes it has some weak points and compared to EW, as far as I am now, its much more gentle but geez.

The first arc (levels 90-95ish) quests are mid at best. This part of the expansion should've been patch content for Endwalker. It isn't even as good as Zero's arc which is patch content, atleast story wise.The 2nd arc is actually pretty good. It's nowhere near as great as EW or Shadowbringers but it's pretty close. There's a lot of character development in some of the main cast that previously hasn't gotten much love, and the story is eerily similar in themes to Shadowbringers. When you get to Xak Tural, that's basically when this expansion starts to actually feel like a real expansion, which, in a sense, is sort of how EW's story worked too.If you don't like Wuk Lamat, just suffer through the first arc and skip everything.

76561198020623060,0,0,english,"I'm normally very critical of FFXIV. I love the game, but it has serious flaws, particularly in the pacing and design of the MSQ. Regardless of your thoughts on the story itself, the [i]execution[/i] of the story is often very weak, with an absurd amount of time spent walking back and forth to talk to NPCs, complete fetch quests, etc. To be clear, this isn't a problem specific to dawntrail, it's present in the entire game.With that said, I think a lot of the complaints about dawntrail are overblown. The story has shifted to a much smaller scale, and I think that's jarring for players who were expecting endwalker 2.0. But I personally think it's a nice change of pace, calling back to the ""adventurer"" days of A Realm Reborn. Unfortunately, that comparison highlights many of the expansions flaws. A lot of what you're doing is done for the sake of world building and tone setting, but could also be described as chores... It really just depends on how much you enjoy a more slow, lore-focused story. I really enjoy it - The light hearted and episodic stories remind me of a Dragon Quest game to an extent. But it's really not for everyone.Gameplay-wise, I'm... mixed. I think the encounter designs thus far have been great, and I love the designs of the two new jobs. But every other job in the game is boring, a problem which was present in Endwalker too. But rather than fix the oversimplification of jobs, they doubled down on it, outright gutting some jobs. Others are largely untouched, but went into the expansion heavily flawed to begin with. Overall, I'm enjoying the expansion, but it's not for everyone. If you like slower paced, light hearted stories with cozy vibes and simple gameplay, you'll probably have a good time. If you're looking for something more though, you might want to sit this one out, at least until the 7.x patches, to see if things change.",1719848853,3,0,positive

They MSQ Content is easy to clear, the only way to fail is if you just happen to unfortunately not read/interpret a mechanic right.(or if you happened to be as simple as a infamous Cuphead Reviewer.)The Expansion gave us alot of complex concepts for the story that need to be dissected as theyll likely lead the player in the future. along with the conclusion and our ""Charges"".as for the upcomming gameplay content cannot yet be reviewd. as it isnt out yet.while the story does need more lenght or time to cook. at this point, the story needs to be divorced from leveling or powering up.

The Solo Duties are fun, maybe not carrying quite the same level of variety as EW provided us with, but the Dungeons and the Trials are perhaps the best we have ever received in the games history. I almost worry that this expansion will act almost like Cataclysm had for WoW back into 2010. Players say they want harder content, hell we even had a ridiculous healer strike weeks before the release of this expansion, but now that we actually have harder content for casual players... How will they react. I legitimately had to mark myself with a Doritos marker and place down guiding markers for the players that joined me in the final dungeons. And this is honestly no hate towards them, I've been impressed with how many of the players I've paired up with in the dungeon finder thus far have stuck with fight no matter how many attempts it may take. But how will the selfsame healers who were up arms merely a week ago now react to content that requires them to actually know how to play classes as complex as SCH and AST.As of writing this I haven't had the opportunity to finish both EX trials yet, and while I may have concerns with EX 2 after experiencing the normal mode, EX 1 has truly dissuaded many of those fears. Mechanics are fast and varied. There are innovative ideas abound, I can't wait to see what sort of Ultimate, Savage and Alliance raids we receive this patch cycle as the very well could be the greatest we ever receive. The short glimpse we have already received of the Arcadion Savage series the aesthetic of an almost Cyberpunk mixed with Dragon Ball-esque tournament set up seems to be nothing short of incredible.

There are queue times, a new continent, and new trials and dungeons to explore. Aside from the post-game activities and vicious raids, this is what appeals to me about the new expansion. I adore world-building, lore, and character development, but let's be honest:We have previously saved the world of Eorzea and the Thirteenth about a dozen times by fighting actual gods, and after Hermes, Meteion, and Hydaelyn engaged in combat with actual gods to preserve the world. After a valiant battle, the Warrior of Light and his allies deserve to relax. The primary purpose of this expansion is to provide precisely that—a break and a holiday. Is it a slow start? Indeed.

Yes, and even if the story's pacing could have been improved in practically every way, I don't mind.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3278715289Dawntrail's primary objective is to set the stage for you to discover a whole new continent and globe, delve deeply into historical and cultural events, and aid others.

The expansions Shadowbringer and Endwalker were amazing and featured many highlights, particularly the battle between Meteion and Hermes at the finale of Endwalker—a real-life gods-versus-gods battle.This is more slower, giving you more opportunities to delve deeply into the cultural distinctions between different countries, their populations, and their rulers. If Pizza is your favorite food in real life and you eat it every single day, it would eventually grow boring and uninteresting, even though Pizza is the best right? The FFXIV expansions aim to address this by slowing down and offering you new foods to eat in order to rekindle your excitement for pizza, so please take a break.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3279508604The next catastrophe is already at the door, so the Warrior of Light needs some rest. I'm interested to see how the story develops after Dawntrail, how it will grow, and what lies ahead for us in the years to come. This is Dawntrail, a freshly constructed continent that advances slowly yet steadily for your enjoyment. It clearly lacks the grandeur of Endwalker or Shadowbringer, yet it is vitally necessary to provide the groundwork for what is coming in the upcoming years.[h1] Take a step back, enjoy your vacation and the historical culture of your beloved friends and comrades because sooner or later you won't have the time for it [/h1]",1719834517,154,8,positive

76561198062688862,0,0,german,"Tjoa, was kann man im Anbetracht der vielen anderen Reviews wohl sagen, die durchaus berechtigte Kritik aufweisen und dennoch eine Empfehlung ausspechen?Das größte Problem ist dieses Mal wohl die Story und ich denke nicht einmal weil der Fokus der Story dieses Mal so anders ist, sondern weil sie ZU LANG ist für den Content den sie bietet.6 Areale, 6 Story Dungeons (die 2 Endgame Dungeons nicht mitgezählt) und 3 Prüfungen sind für die Länge die die Story jetzt erreicht hat ZU WENIG, die Passagen zwischen den Inhalten sind so ewig lang, das man ständig einfach nur irgendwas machen will, nur nicht weiter zuhören und langweilgen.Das Problem war zu teilen auch schon in Endwalker, aber da war es gerade noch aushaltbar, hier hat die Story ihren Zenit der Länge aber weit überschritten und es beginnt der Spielerfahrung aktiv zu schaden.Als langjähriger Spieler erwarte ich von den Entwicklern zum nächsten Add-On min. 1 weiteres Gebiet, besser 2 innerhalb der Story, 1 bis 2 weitere Dungeons und 1 weitere Prüfung um die Story aufzulockern, insbesondere wenn die 8.0 Story noch länger werden sollte als die von Dawntrail.Ein weiteres Missverständniss der Entwickler betrifft wohl auch vertonte Zwischensequenzen.Mit jedem Add-On haben wir mehr davon bekommen, doch dieses mal fühlt es sich an das prozentual genau so viele Zwischensequenzen in Summe vertont wurden wie in Endwalker, diese aber auch viiiiieeell länger sind, auch wieder zu lang, teilweise so lang das man früher wohl eine Warnung bekommen hätte das sich große Ereignisse anbahnen und wenn diese Warnung hier kommt, kann man sich mal eben Mittagessen machen, die Kinder von der Kita abholen, ein Haus bauen und reich mit Crypto werden.Bitte zum nächsten Add-On, kürzere Zwischensequenzen mit mehr Kampf Auflockerung und mehr Zwischensequenzen in Summe die Vertont sind!Was gibt es abseits der Story noch zu wissen?Was die Story für mich wohl am meisten gerettet hat ist das Grafikupdate und die dadurch wunderschön aussehenden, neuen Gebiete, die wirklich zum Erkunden einladen, wären die nicht gewesen, hätte ich, so wie viele Andere die ich kenne die Story wohl abgebrochen.Ansonsten gilt es auch lobend hervorzuheben das die Inhalte deutlich anspruchsvoller geworden sind, natürlich sind wir noch am Anfang des Add-Ons und besseres Gear wird zeigen wie viel von der Wahrgenommenen Schwierigkeit wirklich bleiben wird, allerdings muss man jetzt gerade bei den Expert Dungeons deutlich besser aufpassen!Die Musik ist so weit gut, leider etwas zu wenig was wirklich Soken-esk ist, gerade die Musik der Hauptstadt mit ihrem Jazz Theme ist zwar anfangs richtig gut, aber irgendwann fühlt man sich wie in einer 90er Late Night Show oder wie am Ende einer Partie Mario Kart 8, eher gewöhnungsbedürftig.Würde mir diesbezüglich gerne mal wieder ein Add-On wie Shadowbringers wirken, natürlich muss dafür auch die Story thematisch passen, aber etwas mehr Rock wäre schon cool, statt dem x-ten Full Orchestra Soundtrack.Das 2. Main Theme von Dawntrail (Smile) derweil ist auch recht faul, im gegensatz zum Endwalker 2nd theme (Flow) wird hier einfach das Dawntrail Theme etwas umgeschrieben und dann aber mit mehreren Sängern, was wiederum ganz nett und mal was neues ist, wäre aber passender einsetzbar gewesen in der Story.Ansonsten war die Erfahrung im Spiel, insbesondere zum Ende richtig gut, wenn die Story anzieht, mehr Inhalte kommen, das übliche eben, aber Creative Studio 3 läuft wirklich Gefahr eine ""Ubisoft Formel"" abzulaufen, wenn sie mit dem nächsten Add-On so weiter machen, sie sollten wirklich darüber nachdenken der Story mehr Inhalte zu spendieren!!!Für alle die es noch nicht gespielt haben ein heißer Tipp um die lange Story mehr zu genießen:Vergleicht die Story auf keinen Fall mit Endwalker, sondern mit A realm reborn, denn Dawntrail ist am Ende des Tages nichts anderes als ein A realm reborn 2, anfang einer neuen Saga innerhalb von FFXIV und auch wenn das die Schwächen des Add-Ons bei weitem nicht rechtfertigt, macht es das ganze zumindest deutlich erträglicher, denn besser als ARR ist Dawntrail allemal.",1719825419,1,0,positive
76561198298530681,0,0,english,"To get it out of the way, if you're primarily a MSQ player your opinion likely will be very different from mine. I'm good friends with my esc key and use it liberally when the story drags, mainly tuning in for the more exciting parts. Truthfully there weren't many and whilst I found the first half of the story the a little slow but otherwise fine I absolutely hated the latter half. When the world is being threatened on a calamitous scale and you're touring farms and sampling local food it just feels like bad writing by someone who has no idea of pacing. Wuk Lamat really didn't need to be in the latter part of the story because it felt like her arc had somewhat concluded by the end of the MSQ and we were being beaten over the head with the same things she learned it the first zone. In the end I gave up and sped through to the real reason I love this game: battle content. It's been incredibly refreshing to see the team break free of their shell and try to make fights exciting again. They've made the trial areas more interactive, the new expert dungeons actually have bosses doing more than dynamite and chariot and even the levelling dungeons have pretty much all been bangers. Whilst I haven't done the EX trials yet I'm really looking forward to them as I enojoyed their normal counter parts so much.I've also really been enjoying pictomancer and whilst melee isn't my thing a lot of my friends are having a great time with it. The visuals are gorgeous and much needed in the 2024 gaming environment, and Soken has hit it out of the park with the music yet again.I do feel bad for people who love the story but for me it's always been something I'm happy to take or leave.

The game needs time to reestablish its stakes after lifting the weight of the world off our character's backs. It's not like the game hasn't given us bland moments to build up to award-winning peaks in the past.Do I hope developers learn to expand on the MMO formula? Yes.Do I expect SE to do it in one expansion? No.The nuance is that they have shown mechanical integration in their story more engaging than Fetch Quest 101 but the feedback for those wasn't exactly stellar (looking at you Stalking mechanic).I somewhat agree with the sentiment of Wuk Lamat being... meh. If I had a choice I would rather be with Koana or Zoraal Ja but the complaints about the story revolving around her (which it totally should since the entire storyline is HER vying for the throne; not our character) don't make much sense. The hate for BEST - second best - THI- okay FOURTH BEST cat-person has overshadowed just how bland and generic Bakool Ja Ja is as an ""antagonist"" (so far at least) - especially compared to any of our favorite FF14 villains.

No spoilers, but the end brings some interesting prospect for the future.This expansion has some of my favorite dungeons and fights mechanically and thematically, but those fights are separated by Wuk Lamat saying she loves peace and walking around for hours on end, it gets tiring even if I love learning about the cultures of the Tural.Having finished it, I have the feeling it will follow in Stormblood's footsteps, pretty bad MSQ, great 7.x content, hopefully, and with all these critiques and feedback, maybe the writing can get an upgrade.

If you find yourself disliking the character, you will struggle until the second half of the expansion. Honestly, it feels like an expansion split into two parts, like Tural itself.[h1]Story[/h1]The first half is far lower stakes and much more layed back. Sure there is combat and dungeons (with some actual big threats towards the end of the first half) but overall its focused on the growth of both Wuk Lamat and her brother.The second half is where the actual scaled gets pushed and we feel like we are being challenged from a strength perspective. I don't want to get too into it since its a really interesting twist (but one I did see coming)Now I also do have issues with the first half of the story, the pacing until the first dungeon, but Endwalker almost mirrors this point for point, but it has actual stakes during these branching paths where Dawntrail does not. Wuk's innocences and ignorance also does come off as childlike in a few scenes as well but they are more lighthearted; I can see how some would take issue with them. Lastly, I can see how some people may find one of the twists in the first half a bit forced as did I but I was fine with, but I see some players having issues.[h1]Dungeons/trials[/h1]I think the dungeons and trials are wonderfully designed. The new mechanics are rather interesting and its fun seeing some old mechanics I haven't seen in a long while return. While my own personal taste is focusing on the story and crafting, these feel like they are pushing my skill forward and think rather than turn my brain off and let my faerie do the work.The set pieces are also fantastic and I am looking forward to others thoughts on the dungeon and trial designs.[h1] Closing Thoughts / other things I missed[/h1]I wanted to atleast talk about Viper and Pictomancer a bit though I haven't touched them. Pictomancer looks immensely fun and fairly strong with fluid rotations while Viper itself is far more than ""pirate"" themed as I originally thought. It has more going for it but also seems to be one of the simplest dps classes added. No intense thought about rotations other than swaping swords.Overall, I do see this being polarizing for the opening but I think as people push through and grow to like Wuk Lamat, the expansion might pull around. I think its not the worst expansion (Stormblood is my personal choice), its no Shadowbringers or and certainly no Heavensward.",1719779823,2,0,positive
76561198067377728,0,0,english,"So far, I am really enjoying this new expansion. The story is a brand new chapter into a new story arc which takes its time to show the new world, its little intricate stories, breath taking sceneries and quirky new characters!Personally, I enjoy the main character taking more of a mentor & support role in this new MSQ. Its honestly a breath of fresh air after all the previous expacs where everything rests upon our shoulders, I find it that Meteor's (WoL) journey as a hero is coming to a close at least on this story arc which is all about Hydaelyn & Zodiark and now is taking steps back to enjoy well earned rest.. and of course assisting Wuk Lamat's own hero's journey.For once the story takes its time to unravel, which I can understand is not a cup of tea for other people who'd prefer a simple, clear cut, apocalypse now stories where everything is always constantly on the line.Of course I must state I absolutely LOVE the graphics update, a much needed face lift to bring out even more stunning details forward to make the world of Final Fantasy 14 even more vibrant and lively to be in. Two new classes being, Pictomancer and Viper are wonderful in aesthetics wise, they feel wonderful gameplay wise and fit in quite well with the currently existing roster of classes.Now I'd like to address the other negatives which I have seen in the reviews, all about Wuk Lamat and how the story is boring and a chore.. all of this is by a design.Lets take a trip through a memory lane shall we? Starting onwards from ARR weren't we all bit of a Wuk Lamat at one point? Thrusted into an adventure with only the equipment what we have, new to the lands and what is expected of us both story wise and as gamers. I admit Wuk Lamat can be bit on the nose some times but I recognize the beginning of a journey in her much like how we all had ours, stumbling through the hoops and learning along the way. I find the commentary on Wuk Lamat being simply bad or annoying rather shallow and lame.As for the story, it has been stated many times that the great adventure and chapter of Hydaelyn and Zodiark has come to an end and this is merely a beginning to a new one, a new story if it wishes to be worth of any salt or investment NEEDS time to establish its people, a new world and setting proper. This needs time and patience so it may pave way for something grandiose, of course sooner or later time will always tell where the story goes.

You come to learn the real reason the contest exists and the facets alongside it. The new jobs are very well made! Viper's ability to disengage from the boss at quite a distance and still maintain a lot of damage output if you've built the resources for it. And vicariously hearing it from my friend, Picto seems really busted and has a whole lot of potency! Which makes up for its lack of a resurrection ability like most of the other casters. The twist I've encountered and the hardships and redemptions I've witnessed along the way so far are brilliant for the first story of a new saga.

Some of the new fights and dungeons are absolute bangers, and I'm thrilled to see where they'll take things from here - or, even more, what the extremes will be like. The graphics update definitely shines at some few points, and at others it doesn't. There's the odd pixel Exarch throwback, and as such I do feel it should have been downplayed a little.In all, there's definitely some highs and lows with this one - as with every expansion.

Negative reviews are given by impatient people with issues to manage expectations.This isn't like we are playing post ARR, Dawntrail feels more like Heavensward + Stormblood. It's interesting how stuff works: back in Endwalker, when we travel using the new Aetheryte technique and everyone feels sick, no one complained about it and the fact that Estinien is bad with coins. WHy? because we know those characters for years and it's funny to see them out of place. Who felt annoyed when Alphinaud jumped into the water in Stormblood?  Wuk Lamat is just following the opposite direction, she is way above Lyse and ARR Alphinaud already. She is not arrogant, just childish. Every expansion has up and downs: ARR has post ARR, Heavensward has Alexander and Diadem v1; Stormblood has Lyse, weird pacing and Eureka v1; Shadowbringers has volley; Endwalker has lopporits and later on slower labyrinthos.During Live Letters they focused more in technical aspects (new systems and graphics) than anything else (lore) because  they are working on setting up a decent codebase for more 10 years of development.  My bet: During 7.x, Dawntrail won't be big in terms of lore, but great in terms of content. Probably better than any previous expansion. If you are waiting for the same emotional damage (built during 10 years), you may want to leave and come back in a few years.The lore behind viper makes clear they are looking for simplification in terms of lore right now. What viper do? vipers act as a snake and they hunt big and dangerous monsters, and they like it. That's all. There is nothing magic behind it, no void, no aether, nothing. Just unga bunga. In short:+ Animations+ Graphics update with modern technologies (FSR 2.2 via mods tho)+ Grass sounds+ Natural mounts movements+ Hrotgals looks detailed and cutscenes really want to show how nice they look like. + No waiting time to log in (servers upgrade promised years ago finally is working)+ Viper is an aggressive beast, a nice mixture between Ninja, Dancer and Reaper.+ New filter/blacklist works decently+ TRUST system is definitely worth it. You can level up viper/picto in a few hours (3-4h) from 80 to 90. - Lightning update destroyed some scenes where  darkness/shadows plays a central role to feel immersive. - Dual channel dye doens't work as intended for every equipment. Manual inspection needed by the devs. - Weird choice of music theme for Tuliyollal (day)",1719773262,116,4,positive
76561198050016017,0,0,english,"Update: I'll change it to recommended now, but be warned there is some slogging to be done. The story only gets better a little while after the first half. The other expansion content, especially fights is great. MASSIVE TIP: Turn the cutscene audio to Japanese. The English voice acting of the lead characters (whom I'll refer to as Cat lady & Bunny Boy) is bad, sometimes even hilariously tone deaf. It had me physically cringe a bunch times when the voice I'm hearing does not sound genuine whatsoever when supposedly portraying X emotion. This change has massively improved my enjoyment, although I miss the English scions. ------- Old impression:I'm almost a day of playtime into this expansion and it's a very weak start from a story perspective. I knew it was going to be a more calm story and that is fine since I was tired of the continuous high stakes. However, instead of going on silly little adventures with the gang (as I expected from the promotional material), we just end up being sidekicks for some really bland personalities.These make the main questline an absolute snooze-fest, even if the overall world setting is decent. The rest of the expansion is solid as always, I enjoy the gameplay and new content. I will finish it and update my review.

76561198086895780,0,0,english,"I've just finished the base story. Spoilers obviously ahead. Encounter review past that.The first half of the story revolves around the fight for succession, where your role feels more like that of a mentor to Wuk Lamat. That means that from lvl 90-95 basically you will mostly spend your time with her, so if you dislike her after an hour, the only thing that really changes is her resolve, basically she is like Lyse but if she actually grew as a character and wasn't handed everything, however she tends to be on the goofier side. I personally don't mind that, after the past 2 expansions I sort of needed a break from saving the world every other quest (even if we sort of do at the end of this one) and I like Wuk Lamat even if she got a bit annoying at times. I also liked how Urianger and Dadcred assumed the roles of mentors for Konoa, after all of these expansion it sort of felt natural here. However I have to say that certain parts felt a bit rushed, Bakool Jaja being at first a third rate villain just to give us some backstory and switch to being a good guy while better than just killing him is still awkward when done so quickly and this isn't the only example of that. Zareel Ja also feels like a mediocre villain, almost like Zenos but not as crazy (so as if they removed the only fun trait). However. once you get to lvl 96 msq that's when things start to pick up and get really interesting. I liked the culture of Alexandria and the way souls felt more like currency to them. And also Sphene finally felt like a proper villain and also character. Overall the expansion has set up plenty of questions just as they have aimed to do, Overall it feels like a new ARR, though it is a shame however that the first half is so slow, since I doubt a lot of players will have the patience to sit through a couple of hours of ""fetch quests"". As for the encounters, the new dungeons are without a doubt better than what we got in Endwalker, majority of the bosses won't recycle mechanics even half as much as in the previous expansions. The formula is unfortunately still the same but the bosses at least especially in post DT, were very entertaining. The trials were without a doubt better, normal versions were far more interesting than the first 3 HW/SB/EW, especially the last trial trumps over majority of trials in the game period. The 2 currently released extremes are pretty good, better than EW for sure. Makes me excited about the future trials and especially raids/ultimates. As for music...  come on, Final Fantasy XIV might have its issues here and there but music remains as strong as ever (though I hate that disney song we got, too cheesy even for me).So tldr -If you are willing to sit through a slow beginning, you might enjoy the story as it goes, especially during the second half of it. If not then you'll probably want to skip. Gameplay wise, it is great so far, hopefully SE will keep it up.",1719766746,4,1,positive
76561198031654787,0,0,english,"I have not finished the expansion at the point of writing this, but I feel the need to get my thoughts out in the sea of negative reviews currently plaguing this expansion launch.First things first: If you are a fan of FFXIV and the way it has told its stories up to this point, Dawntrail does not shake things up too much, other than the severe danger de-scaling compared to Endwalker. If you are NOT a fan of the other stories this game tells. YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS EXPANSION.Now with that out of the way, this expansion has a very strong start with introducing characters and motives, and growing those characters. The action in this early part, however, is very small scale. If you can't stand character building, you will not like the pacing. But It is NOT paced badly, everything feels like it happens exactly when it needs too. The quality improvements, both in the story and game as a whole, really make everything feel much smoother than prior expansion. The graphics update, coupled with the changes to armor and improvements on player customization, have a shockingly strong affect on how the game looks. It can be in stark contrast with the items they have yet to update though, so it can occasionally be a little jarring, but they are working on that.And now, for the actual GAME itself. I have only played the new class Pictomancer so far, but it is fun in a very open way, allowing you to slightly change up which spell you cast next, instead of being a purely rigid rotation. They harder fights so far, have actually been significantly harder than similar fights from past expansions, though story content still won't fill that itch for harder content that extreme/savage/ultimate provide.As stated, I still have a ways to go before I can have a comprehensive review, I do plan on leveling Viper to comment on that class as well, and I can't talk about crafting/gathering at all yet, but this expansion is off to a bright start.",1719766517,4,1,positive

She puts on a face of ridiculously shallow optimism because she is crippled by imposter syndrome. And rightly so; she hasn't done anything other than party and faff around with the happy vibes. She desperately needs to make something of herself for a change and find some purpose in life. And her situation isn't helped by the fact that she has no real vision for what to do with Turral after saving it from her brother either. A brother who in in fairness, is trying to speed run the war cycle so no one else will be deluded with thinking it is worthwhile to do so. His folly is he is so fixated on making war a living part of the Turrali consciousness that he surrounds himself with questionable intentions and visions which threaten to undo everything he is working for.While by no means is this 10/10 writing, that by itself is a stunning improvement over the ARR plot of ""invaders with technology equals bad. Also, invaders are manipulated by an apocalypse cult into trying to destroy the world because bond-villain bad guys."". If you compare the Ascians in ARR to Endwalker, you can tell there was a shrieking tonal shift as they finally figured out what to do with them as the underlying antagonists. Have you done your daily story roulette? It's a daily reminder in how FFXIV used to handle its exposition, and it subsidizes your suffering for 350 tomestones.The writing team is trying to reset the tempo. Part of what made EW work so well was how it deeply contrasted with what preceded it. ARR's stakes felt hollow compared to EW's because it had Stormblood and Shadowbringers to ramp up into it. ARR lacked a compelling villain of any kind, and Nidhogg was a singular dimension of vengeance fueled hatred. Zenos made cruelty and malice something real and tangible. Emet Selch made the Ascians complex and impactful. Meteion, while flat and one dimensional, served as a vehicle to describe how nihilism is its own delusion. And given the scale which the conflict had escalated to, that our enemy was less a complex character and more the sum total of a supposition, this was apt.So having done a full Gurren Lagann spiral, the script needs a reset back to dusty tomes, weather worn treasure maps, and dungeon delving.

(apparently a big shocker to plenty of people, that in the beginning of a new story... you actually get a bunch of information about that place and the people you go to. Also incredibly funny, how many self report on not even having made it to the halfway point of the story, simply by their story related complaints.). Then, pretty much exactly on the halfway point, the story flips and we start reaping the benefits of the buildup.Ironically enough, i actually first skipped that particular cutscene, as i thought it to be a mere region transition... just to then find myself in a very different place than expected, in a very different situation and i have never been so quick to visit the next inn and watch the damn cutscene i just had skipped in full.The ending however i was deeply disappointed in. Was cool with the entire story right until after trial 2. Rest afterwards felt very tagged on ""Ey guys, we need a big uber evil still.. how can we shove that in?"" Did not care the tiniest bit about anything there.Feels just as nice to play as always, music is great, although i don't vibe with the tune in the main city, it's still better than radz... which tbf isn't all that difficult.Dungeons are pretty cool. They didn't bs, when they said, they wanted to up the difficulty. Readibility on many things suffered greatly for firsttimers, but after you've seen it, it actually makes sense. The only fight in the entire expansion, that i absolutly dont like, is the final one tho. As far as the new classes are concerned, while i do like the pictomancer generally, it is very underwhelming in the animation department and redrawing your pictures feels awkward. especially the hammer, as it goes *draw hammer* *click button that activates the ability* *use hammer*   feels very weird.With the Viper i don't get warm at all. It has several dozens of abilities that you do not drag onto your action bars, instead ""activate"" them by going through various paths between your primary two abilities.  Your jobgauge is supposed to show you, which route to go... but in reality it doesnt realy show a lot, playstyle is way too fast to look at it in the first place, so you go by the thing that is flashing.Don't like it, i am a big fan of having my buttons on my actionbars",1719754322,1,1,positive
76561198125390692,0,0,english,"[h1]My personal commentary and review of Dawntrail thus far![/h1][h2]No major spoilers[/h2]Amazing Expansion, I'm about 3/4 of the way through it already. As far as new chapters after [spoiler] world ending calamities [/spoiler] go, this is a great starting point. Something lighthearted that explores interpersonal and emotional stories on a ground level with the backdrop of one of the most beautiful locations in gaming.Wuk Lamat is a treasure to spend an adventure with, her willingness to learn about others was a prime motivator, bridging the gap and promoting peace. The characters alongside her developing and learning through the story has also been incredible, and well written. I wont mention much on that front because its a deeply personal story about unity, family, pride, change and forgiveness that needs to be played through.I see a lot of negative reviews about there being 'poor pacing' and 'filler dialogue' from people who clearly don't care to engage with this new location and its people, or their cultures which are a central part of the story about understanding each other and standing united. It's a joke, and they clearly are tourists and dialogue/cutscene skippers just here to complain. Complaints about Wuk Lamat being naive, or too lighthearted (calling her ""annoying"" when she's bubbly and cares about other people more than herself is crazy) when the central core of her character is being willing to learn and understand other cultures to bring people together rather than just killing them for disagreeing are absolutely unfounded and silly. We should be welcoming that mindset at this point in the story, its a fresh start, enjoy a little peace and unity.The DLC isn't perfect (none of the things wrong with it haven't been in prior expansions, like fetch quests, welcome to MMOs people!), or the greatest of all time, but its lovely. The story thus far has been engaging, personal and emotional, and the design of the fights, dungeons, trials and such have been very fun. Definitely excited for the continuing story of FFXIV in the coming years.

By the third dungeon I was really interested in the politics of the new realm we have entered, and Wuk Lamat's accession to the throne. I am not sure what the hate for Wuk Lamat is, because IMO she is reminiscent of what we were in ARR and HW, under the guidance of Papalymo, Yda, Kan-E-Senna, Lyse, etc...Now, I do want to make my opinion clear for the devs- the first quests before the first trial are absolutely and unnecessarily boring... There was really no reason to drag out the tour guide lore that long... It could have been made interesting with maybe some Monster Hunter-esque style quests as we explore the new lands. But, instead we are bartering with NPCs, and doing one-liner interviews with random locals for almost 6 hours... It was boring and I was questioning the expac's quality that entire time.But, after completing the third dungeon I am hoping this game play and pace continues that has been set! We now have reasons to care about these new characters. PROS: * New lighting / graphic update is great! * Not just the graphics, but equipment texture's have been revamped! Cloth, silk, metals, wood floors, stone, etc.. Fantastic job from the art team. * Viper + Pictomancer! I like that the dev team is trying to think outside the box with class designs now. * A new journey to FFXIV begins * It's still FFXIV, and I hope the post-expac content is able to bring us good content!CONS: * First 40% of the MSQ's [gameplay] content is dreadfully boring.

76561198032811805,0,0,english,"Reading reviews might give one the impression that this is a bad expansion. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. And from what I read it's all just complaints about the story, not the game proper.The story:FF14's biggest selling point is arguably the well written story (for the most part). This expansion comes after the drama and high stakes closure of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and tires to present a plotline with a lot less stakes, to have us a break from al lthe world shaking threats. It focuses a lot more on worldbuilding, and honestly feels like a coming-of-age story for Wuk Lamat. On a personal opinion, I find this a good choice, as just adding more and more drama is bound to make any story feel pointless and tiring in the long run. We've seen enough of those in other games.The graphical upgrades:This is a high point of the expansion. Texture, shadows, materials, hell even the ground got a lot better. You really have to see how the gold glitters, compared to the old game.The gameplay:More of the same, though some classes got reworked, so muscle memory can and will trip you up. Healers still don't get any damage rotation. The combat still holds the same pacing, and bosses are constantly trying to get you to pay attention to the animations instead of just the orange markers on the grounds, something that has already been a trend for years now.In short:A worthy expansion to FF14. After the universe saving of Endwalker we were solely in need of downtime. The new world gives the writing team a much needed blank canvas for worldbuilding instead of having to wrangle 10 years' worth of loose ends. The graphics upgrades are phenomenal, while the gameplay is just what you always expected.Yeah 100% recommended if you have the game itself. Also Wuk Lamat is an orange cat with all the mental and physical behaviour that entails.",1719743518,0,1,positive

The start of the story felt like a slow baby sitting simulator and it was very hard to stay focused on the story. However around after the 1st trial i started to get more into the story and by the end i think it ended ok not perfect or as good as the previous 2 expansion storys but not bad by any stretch of the imagination but also nothing amazing i found it nice and enjoyable and am looking forward to what SE does next.TLDR:Class and Battle content amazing.

76561197971396287,0,0,english,"(Early Access Review)A fantastic extension of a game with a long and storied history, Dawntrail sets the stage for the next epoch of Final Fantasy XIV. The story of the rite of succession and the role the Scions & WoL play as background characters providing guidance and assistance for the varying protagonists and antagonists is a change from what people are used to but not all that different from side quest content in which your character was the catalyst in someone else's story. It allows the exploration of themes that weren't possible within the Hydaelaen saga framework and the rigid restraints of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn's mandate.I have enjoyed watching how initial impressions and the frame of marketing has given away to the truth of matters, and look forward to completing MSQ, whose thematic exploration appears to be in the realm of political philosophy. There is more sophistication and creativity in in-game cutscenes and action segments.Still, there is a sense that the Scions are present because of their toolset to help resolve events with their specialties and providing a connection to the past with their observations of the New World. It begs the question how they will be involved in future expansions.Side content and other world-building is still best-in-industry and engaging, with much thought and care put into how the world is what it is and the way characters behave. The new cultures & characters are well-implemented. You come to experience the New World and its people in a way that's authentic to the human experience, with obstacles & conflicts rooted in reasonable disagreements and concerns and solutions in line with the characters and their approaches.Dawntrail upgrades the graphics of Final Fantasy XIV, and it shows. The game is gorgeous and vibrant if you have a system to take advantage of it. Material texture and reflection is the best I have seen outside a trailer for Call of Duty. The new zones are huge in breadth and verticality; they do not disappoint in their design and layout. Legacy areas have changed their look and feel as a result of these upgrades. This new coat of paint refreshes existing content, but some work needs to be done yet as older areas were not designed with this lightning in mind. The new continent has no such issues.The two new jobs are interesting. Viper plays fast and hard with more emphasis and attention to positionals. Pictomancer looks intriguing but I haven't put any serious time into it or got a sense of optimal play, but it appears to fit well with all the other jobs. One downside is that the Pictomancer's abilities tend to obscure elements of the battlefield, which is a bit of a theme with this graphics update: the game is prettier to look at but harder to follow. There are configuration options to help manage this issue.Overall gameplay appears to be entering a new phase; combat is faster, more complicated, and doesn't have quite the same feel as before; different, not worse. The first dungeon I encountered is one of the best in the series and fitting for what is assumed to be an experienced player at this point. Changes to the FATE system adjust incentives and increase rewards sensibly while emphasizing more AOE play with higher NPC counts.One sharp criticism I would have is that something concerning has happened with the quality of the US voiceover work. The Scions are all still there along with a cast of new characters, but something seems off in the delivery and sound mixing. I don't have enough knowledge of audio to know what it is. The issue is most prevalent in Krile & Thancred's delivery, it is gut-wrenching to hear given the high bar set by previous entries and makes me think that it might time to discuss passing the torch with some characters if the cast's heart isn't into it anymore. The music, on the other hand, is what you would expect from Soken & Co: Excellent. There was constant praise in the new home city due to the jazzy nature of the tunes, it felt pleasant and uplifting to listen to.I am biased for this game, as my play count will attest. It represents an inhuman amount of effort that has delivered a quality product supported by past investments to insure the integrity of the game both in a technical and creative sense. While reading some of the negative reviews and understanding some of the criticisms, there is so, so much value on offer here for long-time players. You can tell the developers care about this game and want to deliver the best player experience possible. This title delivers on its marketing promise. There is far too much to go into on a Steam Review given the huge scope of the game and systems being discussed.",1719738410,2,0,positive

There's a lot to enjoy here, and it's easy to tell how much the immense love for the game has resulted in massive QoL changes, from the graphics update all the way to how cutscenes are animated and shot, it invokes a new sense of spectacle the game hasn't had in a very long time. I find Wuk Lamat to be an endearing new addition to our cast, a new personality that isn't a broody, grumbling mess nor someone scholarly and overinformed, Wuk Lamat represents another reflection of wonder and awe for the world, it's people and exploring it. She seems to be controversial for reasons I cannot understand, seemingly perhaps purely due to the fact that she's finding her feet and isn't automatically some sort of immensely powerful adventurer? I'm not sure, as the majority of feedback just seems to cast the broad strokes of the word ""annoying"".

We're no longer just the chosen ones, the only ones that can really fight primals, the Warrior of Light, the Warrior of Darkness, the shard of Azem.

(it starts at lvl 90) so i cannot judge too much about it yet. but the main characters have great characteristics and stand out as individuals.i fucking love it! and so should you if you're a final fantasy fan and love pretty locations.edit after story ended: a note to the developers... never again force a side character to outshine the main character again. i'm 100% sure most of the community has taken a dislike to Wuk Lamat at this point. the final trial was pretty cool only for her to ruin our glorious moment. i dont mind taking a bit of a backseat for the sake of other characters development. but this was WAY too much. i felt like a NPC more then the actual damn warrior of light. AND HOW has nobody heard about the WoL??? SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD? no? doesn't ring a bell? hmmm yeah plot holes a plenty really,1719715795,0,0,positive

The story thus far has been engaging for me, and Im one of the people who doesnt like going through story... but this I love. Not as much as Shadowbringers, but It's pretty good.I feel my review needs to be put up right now to help offset the shitty reviews that I see popping up by people who have clearly not even given Dawntrail a try and are already putting their opinions up before even reading and listening to the story (based on what their reviews are reading, it sounds to me like those people havent even played through the story yet or even spent time in the cutscenes to understand whats happening. I just see a TON of skippers).MINOR SPOILERS in the next paragraphsI love the design of the world. The city feels so strong and full of art and togetherness. So much colour. Ill be honest, im really not even a beach or tropical area person but this is stunning. Especially the looks of the city is so Aztec-y and ancient. I love it!!I love that the focus of the story so far seems to be keeping a diverse country stay together and strong and that Wok Lamat is one of the main people that actually want that and would be able to do that if she were to succeed. I'm excited to play through the rest of the story. So far Im seeing a lot of potential and I think the message so far is good. Wok Lamat is a very good character. I didnt think i would like her at first, but she feels very realistic as a person with her flaws and hardened exterior and has such a kind heart.I love that the vibe of the story is more chill in this expansion since we've already saved the world and are just continuing our lives as adventurers. It reminds me of Frieren a little bit, where the story starts after they've already defeated the Demon King.I'm sure something bigger will happen. I can already tell something is brewing.If they go in the direction of not going ""bigger and bigger and bigger"", Ill be happy, cos I find that games that do this tend to be stupidly ridiculous.Buut anyway, Ill update this as I go through the story. Just feel it's necessary to add some positivity to offset the clear foolishness being posted by people who just are reviewing to either post first or just review blindly cos they had thickened expectations and didnt enter with an open mind and just didnt even watch any cutsccenes or read story.

76561198310056894,0,0,english,"Does it feel a bit odd to go from having had several expansions with world ending calamities over our head to now just being back to a simple adventurer? Yes, but I can tell that the developers are setting up a story to be told now that the previous story was wrapped up in Endwalker. Is the story perfect? No, but I still immensely enjoyed it. Wuk Lamat is an absolute treasure and her VA did such a good job with the character. I was super happy having Erenville join our adventures too. Always nice too see some fresh faces joining our little adventuring crew. What I will say is that the dungeons, trials and just overall the music is some of the best I've seen and heard. A lot of work went into them and you can easily notice that. There was not a single dungeon I didn't like and that's coming from someone who has always had some issue or dislike with an MSQ dungeon previously. I will say that the one thing that is the biggest negative for me though is the amount of fetch quests in the MSQ. I felt there was a few too many of them especially early on and some of the later MSQ quests. I am still however, looking forwards to what else the developers have in store for us in Dawntrail as the patches come along, and I will still highly recommend this DLC to anyone who is a fan of FFXIV. The Pros:MSQThe DungeonsThe TrialsThe Zones & HUB AreasMusicThe Cons:MSQ - The Fetch Quests (there were just a few too many)Pacing can be a bit awkward at times, sometimes it's a bit slow other times things suddenly progress too fast but this has been an issue I've had in previous expansions as well (most notably Endwalker) Some of the voice acting sounded a bit stilted a handful of times",1719703948,71,4,positive

But Dawntrail's getting differing opinions so I figure I'll finally toss my hat into the ring.I won't pretend Dawntrail has been some grand adventure thus far. It's relatively relaxed, and sure you're trying to stop some shitty candidates from taking over Tural, but honestly it has been pleasantly quiet and low-energy after we near-literally ran all over the world to save it in Endwalker, and saved a whole other world in Shadowbringers. The intrigue is low-stakes ARR-tier in comparison. But it's pleasantly relaxing at the same time.The cast is what it needs to be. Wuk Lamat is a very stereotypical anime protag, but considering we haven't really had one of those in XIV I'm willing to let it slide. Plus let's be real, she really is a breath of positive fresh air. Hien but Pollyanna basically. The others have all been rather fun, and it's nice to see the rearrangement of who we know and who we don't.I'm only around level 93, MSQ-wise, as of writing this, but that's enough to know that Dawntrail managed to rekindle a fairly fading ember of being burned out on XIV. The fact that Pictomancer has rocketed to one of my favorite jobs in the game, and the music being amazing...Won't say it's a must-buy, especially when your dollar needs to stretch farther nowadays when it comes to game companies arbitrarily ratcheting their prices. But if you want a vacation after Endwalker, you could do far worse than Dawntrail.UPDATE 7/4/24:If I could hammer the recommend button even harder, I would. The bottom half of Dawntrail is positively insane, and I'd tout it as one of the best shout-outs across all of XIV as a whole. It's no Ultima Thule or Amaurot, but as a longtime fan of the series there is something profoundly incredible about what they decided to do for Dawntrail, at least to me. Call me crazy, but look for yourself if you're really that on the fence. Take a peek, and you'll get an idea of why this immediately swerved to being my favorite expansion.",1719702267,34,4,positive

However I am enjoying the story as someone where Wuk Lamat had to grow on me. It's a brand new start after the 5 expansion long arc that we closed out with Endwalker. I've genuinely had a great time learning about the different cultures of a place that isn't Eorzea and I personally like that our WoL is taking a supporting role rather than being the stereotypical ""Champion"" that every MMO has placed us as (including the last 5 expansions.) The decrease of voiced cutscenes does feel a little bad. Overall, it's a much lower stakes, feel good story that gives our WoL a break for once. Combat feels very good this expansion with the new dungeons and trials. Classes like BLM did suffer, but I think the AST and DRG rework were successful. Big props to the soundtrack, it's very unique to the series and feels appropriate to all areas. If you're expecting EW or ShB levels of action you're setting yourself up for disappointment considering we've known for 2 years from previous LLs that this story would be much lower stakes as it's setting up a new arc entirely.",1719701214,1,1,positive

Sure, the first couple hours might have some characters that are uninteresting to some, and it may be a little trope-y. That's pretty much all within the first few levels though, and by the halfway point things really start to pick up. Frankly, its enjoyable. It might not be some blockbuster finale of a story straight on the heels of a climax many consider the team's best work, and it was never meant to be nor advertised as such, yet it still is a great start to a new chapter in FFXIV. I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far, playing just about every waking moment from the time servers launched, and there is still a bombastic back half of the story that keeps getting better that I have barely scratched the surface of at the time of writing.With that out of the way. Graphics update is incredible, with seemingly little impact to performance at least anecdotally. Dual dye channels on gear is a nice long-awaited feature that in some cases looks great, though in others it might leave room for improvement, particularly when the second channel is a barely noticeable button or strap. New classes look and feel great, and most changes to old classes are solid as well, with a few objective exceptions and a few more subjective. Other minor changes like mounts leaning into a turn and certain actions having hotbar replacement options have been good quality of life improvements as well, however the former has admittedly caused some motion sickness in some others, and not having an option to disable it isn't the best design, though I would imagine it might come at a later date with feedback.Overall, solid 8/10 expansion. Might not replace any favorites, at least not yet, but its better than people give it credit for.TL;DR: Most people complaining about quality of story have gotten through the equivalent of half a paragraph of the prologue, and don't know the banger they're missing out on.",1719695243,5,1,positive

76561197989500568,96510,38,english,"This expansion definitely takes things at a more leisurely pace (so far). It's more of a plain adventure story, far from the epicness of the original arc. Which is fine, and I still don't know how they will ever make any villain threatening again after pulling out all the stops in Endwalker. Performance and the graphical update are good and very welcome. The new classes seem decent. It's a solid core update.In short, this is definitely a worthwhile expansion so far, but mainly if you're looking for something a bit more classical and low-stakes after Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Those two still remain the emotional and thematic core of the game, respectively, and it will probably take until the next expansion to get anything close to that going again.But it's not a bad story, just a lower-key one. It is still about the characters. I don't get the hate for Wuk Lamat, the key focus NPC of this expansion. Yeah, she's meant to be a bit insecure and starts out somewhat overestimating herself based on the conflict between what is expected of her and what she is actually - at that point - capable of. The characterization is perfectly cool. I don't know if people expect some super-heroic Rambo style character here, but if we're supposed to empathize, a character needs to be somewhat flawed and weak, and Wuk Lamat's key weakness is the conflict between who she is and who she believes she's supposed to be.

76561198391792818,0,0,english,"Would like to revise review after finishing expansion, and will try to give a more objective and informed review.(Warning: minor spoilers)Story:First half of the story has terrible pacing, with a lot of filler. Story has the naivete and unsophistication of a Disney movie at times, and is unsubtle and preachy with its themes. I was skipping through cutscenes for the first time in a long time, because I simply did not care about any of the characters, and the story gave me no reason to get invested in anything. Story does get substantially better at the end, however. I think overall the story is quite cliche, and the execution is very inconsistent. Overall, there is too much telling and not enough showing, and the game feels like a kinetic novel where the player has zero agency. But, it does have its own poignant moments that had some real emotional weight behind it. The music and the graphics definitely play a part.Graphics:Graphic update is quite pretty, and some of the new zones look quite magnificent. Nothing much to complain here.Gameplay:Probably the expansion with the worst update to jobs; most jobs get uninspired busywork changes like an extra click of a skill or an increase in buff duration that is basically unnoticeable. Jobs are still incredibly homogenized with no real reason to play multiple jobs; job skill ceiling continues to be reduced with decreased potential for skill expression.Battle content is noticeably better, though, and it feels like they've stayed true to not making everything too comfy for the player.Music:Lots of cool new-sounding tracks; Soken definitely hit it out of the park with this one. While some tracks feel overused or don't fit the scenario, I appreciate the effort of experimenting with all kinds of new genres. The music in the last zone is especially pretty. Overall:Feel like Dawntrail continues to play it too safe, and the game is much more mediocre than it could be. However, the game does have something to offer gameplay/story wise, even if it's wildly consistent. I feel like the expansion is worth playing, and most FFXIV players will enjoy at least some of it, so I'll change to a Recommend (but the Mixed rating is still fairly accurate, IMO, because the game could be so much better)",1719682155,0,0,positive

However, even compared to Endwalker it's not too bad. We have to remember that this is a new arc, and it's going to take time to get back to the level of the previous expansions. I imagine the further we get into the story the crazier it will get. My only complaint is that there have been a few cutscenes that look like they should have been voiced, but weren't.

Personally, I quite enjoyed it because the character writing sat well with me and I like the exploration of cultures and the messages behind it.But you likely won't have the same experience if you just want more Endwalker, more Shadowbringers, etc where your character typically eclipses the other figures in the story. You need to think back on Stormblood-esque dynamics and enjoy following another prominent character who's seeking to grow and become stronger.The gameplay, on the other hand, is stellar! Even people who diss the story tend to agree the entertainment of normal-tier content has been ramped up to where even grinding the same dungeon on loop can be genuinely enjoyable. Some players will be shocked by the increased difficulty, but I think it's now at a wonderful level that respects the player's developed skills and keeps you on your toes, exactly as an expansion this deep into the game's levels should.",1719671830,0,0,positive

76561198062264806,0,0,english,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SOME VERY LIGHT SPOILERS FOR THE BEGINNING OF DAWNTRAIL!I wish I could give a neutral review to a game because I am really on the fence regarding this one. On one hand, new FFXIV expansions always start off slow. Too slow, if you ask me, but I've grown used to it. This one in particular, however, feels ""extra"". It takes SO long for anything to actually happen. More fetch quests than ever before, and more backtracking. It's really not the best pacing, although I suppose I can somehow forgive them for that because it's basically the start of a new story and we cannot really build upon past drama and antagonists.Many people seem to dislike Wuk Lamat, and while I am certainly no big supporter of hers, I really don't mind her all that much. Her personality is funny and her complexes are, to some extent, relatable. I just feel like they don't take enough time to let them truly fester before resolving them, but then again, I am still early in the story, so I cannot really say how it will play out. There are some DT characters I like better than her (her father, for example, fills the Zenos-shaped hole in my heart in his own unique way), but there are also some I like even less. I can deal with it.The first dungeons were decently fun to play, but... it's also just dungeons. Gotta wait for raids to truly see what's up. As for the new zones, they're beautiful to look at and to traverse. I like the new hub better than Old Sharlayan, which disappointed me in many a way. The new peoples are... basic? At least they (for the most part) made an effort to make individual characters behave differently from one another despite their same-y design and the fact that they are defined by their respective cultures. I am pretty neutral on that one. Could've used more new races, however.All in all, a somewhat unremarkable expansion so far. Nothing about it makes me regret spending money, but it also fails at making me as hyped as the ShB or EW opening quests did. Which, to reiterate, might be related to the fact that they have to establish a completely new premise first, thus earning them my benefit of the doubt.I will give it a thumbs up for now, but I might change that depending on future developments and my continued progress.",1719655923,2,1,positive

Like have you guys planned any of the ff14 expansions?Maybe try the game out before buying the newest expansion, a level boost, and story skip.Dawntrail was going to be a hard sell as it’s the foundation to the new story after Endwalker finished off the one that had been building for a decade.The graphical update is a good in between where things don’t look completely different but with better lighting, shaders, and especially textures the rough edges that were showing their age are gone. As they said it (like the glam updates) are a work in progress for older zones, but the new ones really show what they can do.The queue times which are normally the worst, are annoying, but I think my worst one was 45 mins to an hour and fifteen at peak on launch day. If you drop out it’ll save you spot if you log back in reasonably fast and once you’re in unless you afk for a while it won’t error you out (unlike every wow release ever).I haven’t encountered any issues or bugs, but then again my system can run the game (unlike like some reviewers who didn’t check the system requirement pages).The story isn’t amazing (only level 94, zone 3), but I find it’s not dragging on as badly as Endwalker and keeps things moving.So far, I’m pleased and having fun.",1719651264,9,3,positive

Take it as an improved ARR experience to get the baseline running.Shading and models have been slightly improved, and given how the engine works this is an amazing benefit for the player base.Story, as stated above starts slow but slowly winds up to more interesting hooks and plot points. Despite not fully getting through this yet I can't deny they have set some basis on some possible future content/plot.Gameplay, if you enjoyed the prior gameplay then there is not much change, yes some classes are easier now but honestly the new classes make up for the slight ""ease of use"" within other classes.Ignore the ""Bad new character"" comments, I wont say why as I do not wish to spoil said experience.In short, the DLC hosts a slow start but slowly adds in hooks and plot points to develop upon. Those hating the graphics are against change and are upset their cute little MC no longer is the same in their eyes, Same enjoyable combat as before which opens up a nice set of future plot points at my current game play mark.

Since having some glamour you really like from say Eden raids on your graphically updated character model looks off at times.Thumbs up coz of the battle content and graphics and I choose to believe they will get back on track with story in patch quests.

After having saved the world several times over and barely living to celebrate their victory, The Warrior of Light goes on what is essentially a Tropical Vacation adventure while honoring a foe-turned-friend's request that they see all the world has to offer so they can truly appreciate the mantle they have inherited. Our Character takes a back-seat for a while in the story, functioning as the mysterious and powerful Mentor character to the next generation of heroes, literally Those Who Walk Before teaching Those Who Walk After as has been sung in Answers for over a decade now. As the story progresses the Warrior of Light takes a more active role as a new threat is uncovered and they once again fight to defend the world they have been charged with protecting.     As we progress through this story, Dawntrail offers incredible music, some of the most beautiful scenery the game has to offer, two new incredible jobs, one of which quickly became my new favorite, dungeons and trials that are some of the most fun the game has had in years, sets the stage for a bunch of fantastic new content coming up next, a ton of QoL and visual improvements to the entire game that makes older content look and feel even more amazing than before, and I've never been more excited for the future of this game. I was worried that after Endwalker, the story and content team would run out of steam since the stakes literally can't get higher than that, but they immediately put those worries to rest. Dawntrail is, as I said, the perfect follow-up. The Warrior of Light saves the world and gets to go back to just being an Adventurer experiencing new places, learning about new cultures and people, facing new foes, and continuing to appreciate the world they saved.The Mixed reviews at the time of posting this review are already climbing back up as people who actually play the game finish up with the story and come to leave their own review, and in the meantime people like a certain grifters on Twitter will continue to cry about how this game is ""woke"" without realizing FF14 has been ""woke"" since the very beginning. This has always been a game about friendship, co-operation between people and cultures, fighting back against oppression and cyclical violence, and having empathy and compassion for the struggles of others, as Final Fantasy as a franchise has for decades.Dawntrail is an incredible expansion, it surpassed all my expectations, put all my worries to rest, and I can't wait to see what comes next.",1719622696,1,0,positive

76561198079463191,470198,8293,brazilian,".  Sem sombra de dúvidas foi uma expansão divisora de águas, embora meu saldo tenha sido positivo (já tinha imaginava que as coisas seriam mais ou menos assim) e eu tenha me divertindo, acredito que essa expansão foi a que teve mais pontos que me incomodaram, sobretudo a primeira metade da história que foi arrastada e um pouco previsível e o balanceamento. Não odiei a personagem da Wuk Lamat e entendo toda a jornada dela durante a expansão, mas o jogo poderia ter dado um pouco mais de espaço para os outros personagens principais e secundária como uma forma de respiro para evitar algumas repetições maçantes;.  Já a segunda metade da história foi o que me deixou realmente feliz e salvou a expansão pra mim, a pequena viagem com Erenville e confusões no ""velho oeste"" foram os momentos que me remeteram ao início da jornada como aventureiro ,dias mais simples, gostaria que essa parte da aventura tivesse tido mais ênfase também.Solution 9 e Alexandria foram uma grata surpresa, a apresentação de uma nova civilização com modo de vida completamente diferente mostraram que FFXIV ainda pode surpreender mesmo depois de tudo o que já foi visto em expansões anteriores e as questões existências e filosóficas presentes a partir de Shadowbringers, continuam fortes aqui, tanto é que gostaria de ter tido mais chances de interagir, conversar e questionar mais a personagem Sphene que apesar de ter motivações e objetivos claros, parecia ser uma personagem muito profunda;.  A jogabilidade em grande parte se manteve boa interessante, tirando os reworks de algumas classes e as novas classe, a jogatina no geral, se manteve a mesma. O ponto que me incomendou aqui foi com relação ao Dark Knight que eu sinto que ainda falta algo na classe, algum diferencial em habilidade que o destaque dos demais tanks;.  As portas para uma nova saga foram abertas e eu mal posso esperar para saber mais, também espero que Yoshi-P e a equipe ouçam os feedbacks dos players e usem as nossas experiências para corrigir erros e refinar ainda mais a história e o jogo de modo geral (por favor não esqueçam de adicionar chapéus para Vieras e Hrothgar, estamos esperando há muito tempo);.  FFXIV tem a completa capacidade de expandir e manter a qualidade que cativou seu público, mas para fazê-la é necessário atenção e cuidado para com jogo e a comunidade;",1719613153,0,0,positive

76561198072442688,0,0,english,"A friendly reminder that in MMOs, the main character always wins.The reason why Endwalker hits hard is the same reason why WoW has a bad story now, scarcity. If every single expansion is about the world ending and it being an MMO, the good guys always win, there is nothing on the line and it ruins the story. If you flow from Endwalker into something like Dawntrail it takes a much better turn than going from one universe ending threat to another.This expansion truly has island adventure vibes and it captures that vibe really well with nothing but beautiful zones all around, I especially love the implementation of South and North American cultures across the zones but then for players who aren't super into those types of zones there is a nice surprise in the final two zones to finish it off. The story in the first half plays out like an adventure anime following a race to the throne with a couple neat twists in there that keep it interesting throughout, whilst I do agree there has been some pretty mediocre quests throughout and some down right filler quests so they could hit that sweet 100 MSQ per expansion mark, for the most part I would say a good 80-90 of the 100 quests are good and keep up with an engaging story. The second half of the expansion is definitely the better half but I think we can all agree that is usually the case, the first half feels like a lot of world building and a massive intro to the story for a killer second half.Job changes/additions across the board have been great at least from the perspective of a Warrior main, we get an even bigger smack down now which is animated beautifully, the new jobs are really fun to use and the unique abilities of Pictomancer are always cool to see.I've played all except one dungeon/trial and they have all been really good with interesting mechanics across the board, I'll admit there is some recency bias here but some of the new trials are probably up there as my favourite.Yes there is some annoying characters here or there, I personally can't stand Erenville for example but the story is pretty damn good, the zones look fantastic and most importantly the glams look top tier.",1719588973,0,0,positive

Engaging story and the new graphics update is a welcome addition. Queue times are being handled pretty well as compared to Endwalker's launch. Regarding the vocally loud small group of complainers. The expansions story is meant to be less ""high stakes."" This has been deliberately mentioned every live letter because this is starting a new ark for the storyline. Some of the writing isn't nearly as good as it should be imo, so I can agree on that, but part of this is purposeful to explain why the center characters are flawed in the story. I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people speedrunning the MSQ and not taking the time to enjoy it. It's only been out in early access for not even three days, this is not enough to full embrace and understand a massive expansion yet.While I agree the story is not at its high point; it is not meant to be. This expansion was even advertised as being an adventure that wasn't out-of-this-world. I also understand the disdain for Wuk Lamut - though take into consideration this character is designed to start out as blissfully ignorant. She was raised as royalty and doesn't understand the world yet. The point of her being a fool is so that she develops, and to further display how royalty isn't always fit to rule. The way I see it, this is practically Stormblood 2.0, and is similar to ARR to put down lore foundations, and I'm fine with that.The small amount of vocally angry reception is honestly a reflection of gaming culture itself. We should be enjoying media, while critically analyzing it, but not trashing and thrashing about like children.Just enjoy the video game. It's not like this is Ubisoft releasing trash for $70. It's a $40 expansion that was advertised as being a fresh adventure, and I think everyone should take the time to enjoy themselves. Let's all enjoy 7.0 together.",1719580235,1,0,positive

Junto de recompensas para fãs a longo prazo.Poderia se imaginar que Dawntrail manteria os padrões de expansões anteriores, e até o momento de Early Access, 3 horas e meia de jogo, posso garantir que a experiência está muito desfrutável, é visto o trabalho até mesmo na questão de congestionamento de filas, onde está mais fácil de acessar o jogo mesmo no pico de jogadores.Resumidamente o enredo deixa claro o direcionamento a um novo arco, uma nova história depois do desfecho final de tudo que se deu a Endwalker, trilhas sonoras estão estupidamente belas, e várias juntos de fatores nostálgicos que entenderão por meio de diversas referências a acontecimentos passados que são citados de forma congruente até mesmo através da música.Os gráficos são divertidos, mas tem um ponto ruim.

76561198183674487,0,0,english,"""Dawntrail"" is a remarkable expansion with well-developed characters and a refreshing change of pace. This shift was much needed for the storyline, and it required a change in my own approach: I took my time completing the main quests, engaging in FATEs and side quests along the way, which allowed me to finish the main story with two jobs at level 100.Cultural Representation and ZonesThe new zones introduced in the ""Dawntrail"" expansion are a testament to the developers' dedication to cultural representation, particularly of South and Central America. These areas are diverse, depicting various regions such as:The Andes, inspired by Argentina, Colombia, and PeruIguazú, influenced by Brazil, Paraguay, and ArgentinaAmazoniaThe Caribbean and Mexico/Texas Far WestAs an Argentinian, I could identify numerous cultural, political, and habitual references that made these zones feel authentic. The graphical updates, enhancing shadows, lighting, texture materials, and character models, further enrich the experience.Character DevelopmentThe expansion wisely gives characters like G'raha Tia and Y'shtola a break, preventing overuse as plot devices. Instead, we are introduced to new characters like Wuk Lamat, whose naive charm is reminiscent of Sora or Tidus.Narrative and Gameplay IssuesHowever, ""Dawntrail"" inherits a persistent issue from both Final Fantasy XIV and notably seen in FFXVI: an overreliance on filler cutscenes and missions that simply move the player from point A to B after epic moments. This old model of storytelling can be tiresome. Other RPGs, such as FF7 Rebirth, NieR Automata, and FFXV, integrate lore and world-building more seamlessly through in-game dialogue and dynamic interactions.""Dawntrail"" lacks engaging gameplay outside of dungeons and trials. It would benefit from utilizing the instance duty system more effectively, incorporating lore-building dialogues during combat or exploration. Additionally, improving exploration speed is essential; while the zones are vast and beautiful, both players and their mounts feel sluggish.Technical Enhancements and DrawbacksOn the technical front, the graphical updates include improved animations and lip-sync during cutscenes, significantly enhancing the game's visual appeal. However, the DLSS implementation is subpar, lacking preset choices, a dynamic DLSS option, DLAA, and causing issues during cutscenes such as blurry backgrounds and texture artifacts. An option to increase internal resolution would also be beneficial, as the current method forces changes to the HUD.ConclusionOverall, ""Dawntrail"" is a strong expansion that introduces significant cultural representation and technical improvements. However, it could benefit from addressing narrative pacing issues and enhancing gameplay and technical features for a more immersive experience.",1719571138,0,1,positive

The story really picks up at around the level 96 quests but from there for me it got better and better leading up to the ending. Dawntrail also brought along Pictomancer and Viper, I have been maining Pictomancer from Dawntrails release and it is a very fun job, Viper i haven't touched yet so I have no clue about that job. We also received the new Raid series The Arcadion which i haven't started yet but am very excited to.

Hub city, general introduction out of the way, and into the first zone, and the theme was set for the expansion. Boring chores while relegated to sidekick for a somewhat monotone protagonist of the story. Villains literally boiled down to trash ""I was sad once, I just wanted to play on the playground"" motives. I could deal with that, not the instant ""But I forgive you for all your sins :DDD"" attitude after. Wuk Lamat isn't a strong enough character to carry the plot. The performance is also a bit flat and monotone. (No childish crap hate over the actress being trans. Trans rights are human rights. She's just a rookie VO receiving meh directing)Dawntrail was a slog to get through. Attempts at cultural showcase felt more like bad tourism after a brief wikipedia skim. Class design that overthrows previous classes because they're new and flashy while complexity isn't rewarded. Soken's weakest performance yet on OST (it's still a solid 7/10 OST though.) and an overstated, overshowcased graphic overall that you ultimately only really feel if you're a gpose addict, and they're modding over all your improved textures anyway.The only part I enjoyed was the lil corn dude looking to help the hungry in each area.It was bound to be meh because it suffers from ""new arc expansion"" issues, but I didn't think it was this bad.

This is worsened by the AWFUL voice acting of Wuk Lamat. Moments that are supposed to be extremely sad just feel like she is not in a good mood, and happy moments feel like she’s exchanging pleasantries. And if you don’t like her, buckle up because she’s the main character now and is in almost 90% of the MSQ.Jobs do feel like an improvement and are overall very enjoyable, and the dungeon/raid content is good, no doubt. But when you have to go through this garbage MSQ, it just becomes not worth it. It’s a shame considering the MSQ has always been an enjoyable part of the game.

It became interesting only within the last few levels and around the last zone for me.- The voice acting is very weird in this expansion for some reason? Especially the Wuk Lamat art direction. I don't have anything against her VA, she's just doing her job, but clearly the directions she's been given by the higherups were terrible. She's become a meme in the community because of how emotionless she sounds most of the time. Sfeeeeen lissen to mi.But it's not just her, other NPCs we know and love have some problems too (from the top of my head Y'shtola having poor quality mic, Thancred speaking in weird hushed voice most of the time he shows up).Not everything is absolutely terrible about it of course.

76561197979679811,45316,14305,english,"Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail feels like an echo of something once expansive, ambitious—a faint afterimage where there was once grandeur. The sweeping arcs and richly layered mythos of past expansions have here been pared down, until only fragments remain, like forgotten landmarks in the bright, restless landscape of Eorzea. Central to the expansion is Wuk Lamat, a character introduced with such insistence that one suspects she was conceived as part of some marketing exercise rather than a story. Her role is oddly dominant, shading the WoL into something more passive, more ancillary, as though we are spectators rather than protagonists.Gone is the narrative density that once felt almost Homeric in scale, replaced instead by what can only be described as a ‘beach episode’—a digression that, while bright and vivid, offers little depth. It’s an impression of substance, in the same way an elaborate backdrop might suggest a world beyond, though a closer look reveals little behind it but scaffolding. Even the familiar faces—the Scions—who once felt like companions drawn from the epic canon, have been reduced to cursory appearances. They hover on the periphery, all surface and nostalgia, like cameos designed to remind us that we once cared.In this parade of tropes, the world begins to feel strangely small, its ambitions stifled. The gesture toward Latin American culture, while vibrant in palette, feels about as grounded as a travel ad. It’s there for the eyes, not the heart, offered up in a way that evokes the sheen of familiarity without delivering the pulse and intricacy that could have truly made it part of Eorzea’s world. It’s as if the worldbuilding, once grand and unified, is now assembled from the patchwork of focus groups and market-tested designs.What remains is the persistent sensation that something vital has been lost, that Dawntrail is a dream of a story only half-remembered, an impression more than an immersion. The story unfolds like a modern series pitched to entertain briefly and then pass away without much trace, a glimpse of something that was once more than the sum of its parts. It is a long way from the epic tapestries that made Final Fantasy XIV what it was, and, if anything, it is a reminder that the soul of a story lies in what it risks, not in what it repeats.",1728537969,26,0,negative

76561197969712114,0,0,english,"Played FFXIV during ARR/2.0 for a little while (crashed out around lvl 44 or so when the XP walls became too tedious for me), then returned for Shadowbringers/5.0, just before the 5.1 patch landed.  I probably subbed 9-11 months of the year after that, with my longest break being in Endwalker.Dawntrail is what killed FFXIV for me.  Unlike what a lot of reviews will say, I didn't particularly dislike Dawntrail's story.  It's basically a shonen anime story mixed with some common Final Fantasy themes.  I don't think it's a *good* shonen anime story, but it functions.  I skipped most of the non-major cutscenes (and went back and watched the ones that I later learned were major cutscenes), but I began doing that late in Endwalker, too.  That kind of arrives to my major problem with DT and why, after thousands of hours, I'm done with FFXIV for the foreseeable future:Square-Enix does not put enough effort into innovating and improving their game.  After ShB, EW, and now DT I can say I am quite frankly sick of the ""really bad visual novel"" way the game tells stories and all of the numerous limitations that the MMO engine and design place on what the story can do and where it can go.  I ended up playing WoW Dragonflight during the EW lull just to see what the other half of the coin is doing and while I'm not going to claim WoW is ever going to be a game you play for the story, I think the *way* it tells its stories is just head and shoulders above what XIV is and has been doing.  Because WoW keeps evolving and trying to improve, while XIV hasn't changed at all since ARR/2.0 except for gradual improvements to smoothness of animations in cutscenes, better voice acting, and so on.But, honestly, I'm more of a gameplay player than a story player.  I enjoy a good story, but I can also slide through a passable story as long as the gameplay is engaging.  And this is another major flaw in XIV, in that the gameplay also hasn't changed.  The gameplay of XIV's main story quest barely qualifies as ""gameplay.""  Go to this marked location, do a thing (usually talking to a marked NPC), repeat.  Sometimes it will spawn a couple of monsters for you to kill, neither of which is remotely threatening and requires no effort to kill.The moment to moment gameplay in XIV has always been a sore spot, and I just can't have patience with it anymore.  A low level Warrior in World of Warcraft's Season of Discovery mode has more going on at any given time than a high level Warrior does in FFXIV - how does a game that's fundamentally a month shy of 20 years old at this point somehow have more varied and nuanced gameplay than a game that just released a new expansion?  There's just no reason it needs to be this way, other than (for whatever reasons) Square-Enix simply refuses to even try.The final nail in the coffin, for me, was a surprising lack of anything to do after completing the Dawntrail story.  I did the ""expert dungeons"" a few times each, and enjoyed them.  I did the two available ""extreme trials"" several times each on different roles, and had a lot of fun there.  I did the normal raids a couple times each, and had fun.  And I quit literally a day before the savage versions of those raids arrived, because I just... didn't really want to grind gear in party finder, logging in only to reclear savage raids each week and occasionally visit my house to refresh the demolition timer (another black mark against Square-Enix), and otherwise not really playing outside that.  I didn't care for the mounts I wouldn't use, from the extremes.  I didn't want to grind dungeons for rewards I no longer had any need or interest in, because that quickly devalues whatever fun they might have held.  I'd long since done most of the soloable content from previous expansions during the COVID lull in Shadowbringers and the exceptionally long delay between EW's final patch and DT's launch (and that's even with not having been subscribed for over half that period.)  I might have been able to find some groups for the remaining group content I was interested in finishing, like Bozja or the last few Blue Mage raids I needed for the mount, but with savage days away and with many people not even done with DT's story, pickings were slim at best.So I called it.  I want to keep playing XIV.  I enjoyed the setting, I enjoyed the players (something I can't say about WoW), but I just can't justify the subscription fee for a game where the developer just seems too complacent to be willing to put effort into innovating and improving the game.

They had increased the time between, and delivered what felt like far less replayable content. I struggled to find anything to keep me going. Now Dawntrail is here. I quickly found myself doing the same I was doing in Endwalker. While I really liked the new normal raids, but I'm not interested or have the time for savage. So I feel I'm left with just roulettes to log into daily. The new dungeons are really good, but I'll never get them outside of the three I can get in expert roulettes. Roulettes almost exclusively give me ARR content, their worst designed content in the game, every day. It doesn't look like that is going to change in 7.1.I want to log in and have fun with my friends but besides us running painfully easy maps where you can't even get an AOE off as a caster before the enemies are already dead, and doing roulettes every day getting the same ARR content over and over again for tomes to get gear I don't care about, there's nothing left. We just pray to find new people to play with cause it's something to do. Dawntrail, unlike Endwalker at least sounds like they are pulling everything out for it. Hopefully the exploratory zone is good because right now it's the only thing in FFXIV's pocket with somewhat enjoyable grind.

Wuk Lamat could've been a good ""main character"", however not only is she annoying and poorly constructed but the writing doesn't help either, she has ""secondary comic relief"" energy BUT  we see her almost ALL THE TIME, there is barely any screen time for other characters from our group, and when there is, they rarely add anything of value (More on that later) with the only exception being Erenville who I did like. Basically, my main problem here is Wuk's screentime, it's just too much, it's just so tiresome, gets boring FAST and besides, this is a ""ROLE PLAYING GAME"", are we in the wrong if we expect to also play a pivotal part in the plot rather than sit and watch Wuk Lamat do stuff? If I (The WoL) wanted to take a backseat I'd just play any other videogame, so, what's the point of being a yes man to ONE NPC for 40 to 60 hours?-""You wanted less of the Scions? Too bad, they are here! You wanted MORE of the Scions? Too bad, they do nothing!""A double-sided problem that has many layers that also intertwines with game-play to a degree. So, here they are, ""some"" of the scions in your group...but they add NOTHING of value, they are non-characters, they might as well not be here AT ALL, even Krile, her arc and some of her story happens off-screen and she gets a  very small focus despite her ""main focus"". They should've gone all the way and have only Krile come with us and make up a new party that consisted of people from Tural...but sadly both gameplay and ""fanservice"" get in the way, we HAVE to have the Scions for the ""TRUST"" mechanic, so good luck having a non-playable race party member in the story, but they are also here because they know people will cry if they are not present, in the end, we end up with the worst of both worlds, the usual characters but they are just cardboard cutouts of what they used to be...and don't get me started on ""how we faced Urianger and Thancred"" in the contest (This never happens, so it ends up being a waste).-""You just hate learning about new cultures""Credit where credit is due, I am from LatAm and I really loved seeing aspects from my country and food in there, but sometimes I do think the society ends up being a little too ""idealistic"" and ends up a little uninteresting in the end. I've seen people say ""how boring, we gotta cook some mexican dish in MSQ "", but that's not the issue, the problem is that the story is poorly told, we go around talking to NPCs and learning about it... but they prepare the dish off-screen which was a total bummer, it's supposed to be an audio-visual medium so why not take full advantage of it?. Rinse and repeat for almost every challenge, Wuk Captures her Alpaca off-screen instead of it being a fun minigame or something, it's just uninteresting. I DO want to see more of the cultures... but they mostly only ""tell you about it"" and you don't really get to experience it in any interesting way.-""You just hate that the stakes are now low""Not really, no, besides, the stakes end up being HIGHER than every other expansion (Other than Endwalker, maybe) as if we fail it means the eventual erasure of every other shard, that is way worse than the ""rejoining"" if you ask me.-""Don't be too hard on it, it's basically ARR again, they are cooking!""First of all saying ARR was bad is a bit of revisionism considering it was highly praised on release (Mostly because it was compared to 1.x) and then it slowly took a dip in popularity because... the expansions following it were even better (Which is... a GOOD thing), that doesn't mean ARR is now suddenly bad. It did have actual lower stakes for sure (Personally, I find the post ARR MSQ the ture boring part at least up until you reach ""The Keeper of the Lake"" but it does have a LOOOT of optinal dungeons and content to take a break from the cutscenes). It also offered something other than MSQ, and that was freedom to explore most of the map after the first few hours, getting lost, discovering an optional dungeon, etc..  it ACTUALLY felt like and adventure, not like a guided tour in the Americas. It is not a fair comparison. Also, MSQ should be good on it's own ON RELEASE, not good in retrospect because they will deliver some cool payoff in 10 years.I could say more, but I wanted to tackle these usual things people in defence of the game bring up. I hope I HOPE they return to their previous quality in MSQ in the next patches at the very least. I DO love the game, story and characters, but they were mishandled this expansion, very sad because I wanted to love this game that finally tackles the culture from my country.Final note on game design, I really wanted them to take a risk in terms of how the story goes, like being able to explore at your leisure and discover things on your own, something to shake up the fomula in both gameplay AND story, because having to babysit an NPC is hardly a good ""risk"".",1728356605,17,0,negative

Recommend if you like watching a whiny nepo baby have everything go right for her while you act as a yesman and a sellsword the whole time. The morality of some of the major events in the second act is not at all addressed, and the result is a thoughtless approach to a very complex issue. While I praise Shadowbringers and Endwalker for their nuanced approach to the topics they focus on, Dawntrail has a Steven Universe level of ""They said sorry so it's okay,"" or ""We can't judge them for their culture,"" when the characters and cultures in question are morally reprehensible.At this point, if 7.x MSQ doesn't fix the issues at hand I will just be cancelling my sub. Something had to follow Endwalker, but this is spitting in the face of the 10 years of storytelling it follows.The pre-existing characters who are brought into the story feel nothing like themselves, and the flaws and experiences that defined them are seemingly completely forgotten. WoL is similarly affected; the very subtle character development and behaviors that they were defined by over the course of the game are forgotten, and they are back to the ARR standard of doing whatever they are told without questioning it and without offering any kind of input.I wholeheartedly feel that if WoL was not present during this expansion the story would not have changed at all.

Playing FF14 over WoW has been a big change and I can say I regret not giving it a fair chance sooner. The game itself has me addicted at this point. However,  I'm almost at the end of Dawntrail and as far as the story goes it's not good. Especially the main character they make us follow for this expansion. However, I do really enjoy the dungeons and I've been told by many the endgame is where the fun is at.Without spoilers: We assist Wuk Lamat in a contest to be the next king/queen of their nation. We are on Wuk's team against her 2 siblings and 1 other antagonist. ALL 3 of the other are written better than she is. Each character has their own policies for the nation. Wuk's policies are ""peace and happiness."" Peace and happiness isn't a policy you dumb cat! I would have rather assist one of the siblings instead of Wuk. Her character is just annoying, a try hard, weak, truly has nothing going on in her head, and just wouldn't shut up.... just give me a random Khajiit from TES and that would've been a better character. I lost my freaking mind wasting 45 mins getting a saddle to catch an alpaca for a quest while her brother rolls up already completing the quest with an alpaca... (if you played you know the alpaca!) Toward the end of the contest all the work you did became pointless with how it played out. There is a few good moments where the story would pull me in for 5 mins then I was checked out again for hours until the next big event pulled me back in. When I finally got a break from Wuk, it felt like I was thrown into a horrible filler season of an anime where the anime gets canceled after that arc. When the arc ended I was dealing with Wuk again...If I were to rank the expansion it would be Shadowbringers > Endwalker > Heavensward > Stormblood > Dawntrail > ARR.The ONLY reason why Dawntrail is not at the dead bottom is because ARR was so slow setting up characters who have been with you from the beginning and the setting of the world. I'm still gonna dump my game time into FF14 because I do love my community and have been enjoying the game greatly apart from the Dawntrail MSQ. Square Enix, do better next time.

About 2 years ago this game started inching towards becoming a waiting room for a new good MMO, which is now fully the situation. This game does not let you have any real choices of any kind, or make your character truly individual, and there is nothing in the game that involves or relies on skill. The dungeons have become boring aquariums with glass walls on either side and an obstacle-free path in the middle. 85% of typical random ingame chat has vanished off behind Discord. If you're looking for fun you're going to have a hard time finding it here. Devs have neglected the game for years, or at best had the wrong ideas and priorities, especially PvP, where the devs have allowed a cheat meta to exist for countless months, and also setting up a host of intricate job action macros will give you a decent unfair advantage (but only about 5% of players bother, enough to steal match wins though). The game was going to a good place, but the devs took a few wrong turns, were then informed by the community about the wrong turns, so the devs then took more wrong turns and refused to turn back. Dawntrail's controversial story quality, which can be banged out for an alt character in just 3 afternoons (unlike prior expansions), is the least of their problems. The screenshots shown on the Dawntrail store page look great but are not properly representative of the experience, and the zones you visit have become no-reason-to-go-back questing backdrops more than ever.I would almost recommend the free trial so you can play A Realm Reborn- but they did nerf  and tamper with the two final main plot dungeons of ARR and made them less impactful, changed/removed scenes and dialogue (some were voiced), and reduced the amount of players you do them with from 8 to 4, making them just the same as any other dungeon.

I didn't care about the second half of the story or its stakes whatsoever and found myself missing our typical cast of characters. The post-Endwalker content held strong and excited me for what was to come, but having finished Dawntrail and being forced to sit with the quick epilogue that happened immediately after the final boss, without a chance to resolve anyone else's stories, save for Erenville's and Wuk Lamat's, I'm a bit worried for the future of the game, as it's built a reputation for it's strong and emotional MSQ.

I found myself skipping most of the cut-scenes after about an hour of being over exposed to the expansion's spotlight character. Be prepared for some new and well designed zones that evoke a sense of narrative storytelling that would be superb.... if it wasn't completely overshadowed and trivialized by the main story. This might be forgivable if the main story was engaging... but instead you're playing chaperone and second fiddle to Wuk Lamat. Wuk Lamat is an incompetent and often times insufferable character who feels like a writer's pet that escaped from the realms of fan fiction. The character in small slices would be just fine, but she fails in depth to provide any means of connection to you as a player which is horrific for a character they have framed as the expansion's main protagonist. She is a self centered, virtue signaling, shallow character who should have been little more than a quest NPC or perhaps a recruit to the long stale Scions at best. None of these facts have anything to do with the character's VA, who has been inserted in the usual drama whenever somebody from a particular community receives any measure of criticism whatsoever. Content wise, the game is in many ways at its peak. But lets be real; that is not a very high bar and its gated behind the most banal story campaign they have written as of yet. We enjoy ff14 for the stories it shares and allows us to experience with our friends. When you fail to deliver engaging narrative in ff14, you essentially fall flat.  14 has had its moments where it was weak (ARR and stormblood) in the past, and recovered with some of the best (imo) MMO storylines I have ever played (Heavensward, Shadowbringers). Hopefully they listen to the feedback and don't hand-wave all their dissenting criticism as toxicity, however that seems to be the industry trend. I will ultimately NOT recommend the game during Dawntrail, however if you're considering this game as a new player there is a feast of content leading into danwtrail that will keep you engaged for months.

I love side characters, cultures, and zones (which is why the Ruby Sea and Azim Steppe were able to carry Stormblood for me), but the characters and story just ended up being ankle deep. Plenty of cool concepts, but the only characters I really liked were [spoiler]Gulool Ja Ja, Koana, and Sphene, altho Sphene really is just on the list because I do like her concept[/spoiler].I feel like I was pretty much the ideal audience for a lot of this, but like, let me spend time with the people of the separate cultures (as with Kurenai, Sadu, Magnai, Hien, Gosetsu, etc), I don't need Wuk Lamat editorializing everything and forcing me to experience everything through her [i]interpretation[/i] of these other cultures and characters. This is a common pitfall for a lot of writers who focus on empathy: substituting someone else's experience with their empathetic [i]perception[/i] of that experience. Empathy is important, but it's often inaccurate and generally doesn't capture human complexity. A related pitfall is reducing all conflict to misunderstandings--empathy does not cure all evils. A good deal of conflict arises because people are (appropriately) passionate about conflicting values or because victimization is complex and restitution to one victim damages another victim's chances for restitution. (sorry for jumping into theory)I do wanna give props to the zone design people tho. I really do love the zones.(Accidentally found out Wuk Lamat's VA is a notorious troll was unpleasant. Unfortunately, the VA is not qualified to handle a lead female role.

EVERY moment I felt like I was going to find something enjoyable in the plot it was undercut moments later. Your characters duty as ""mentor"" to the new main protagonist is relegated to standing to the side and clapping as she overcomes all obstacles through the power of love and delivers one horrendous speech after another. When the stakes rose to their highest I still couldn't find relief from the inane ""walk around town and ask people about their feelings"" drudgery. Even to the very end, when I finally thought I would get some relief from the absence of the walking, talking void of charisma that is Wuk Lamat, she LITERALLY breaks through the walls of reality to remind you how little you are enjoying the game. I have no issue with the idea of relegating the WOL to more of a side character role and focusing the story on another character. I thought they did quite well with that in the Endwalker post MSQ.

They want to wipe everything clean and start fresh that's why the older characters feel like complete strangers with no personality.

Endwalker was okay too. I warmed on it gradually I think, I felt lukewarm about it initially but I grew to be reasonably satisfied with how it ended - especially after the Endwalker alliance raid series, and ESPECIALLY after THIS nonsense.Dawntrail is the worst expansion I have played so far, by a lot, purely speaking of the story. I am not referring to gameplay here, which has been good. I think it's great to play at least, like the other expansions are as well. No complaints there.But this is just going to be a review entirely of the Dawntrail MSQ because, I haven't played Dawntrail since I cleared the story and I don't know if I'll even continue to play for the rest of this expansion, I am kind of just disgusted by the game right now. I intend to avoid spoilers in this 'review' if at all possible, I'll be vague about the twists and turns it takes.If you are reading these recommendations, or played it yourself, you probably know Wuk Lamat is something of a divisive issue. For my part I don't think I so much detested her because of the characterization of her, which is fine really, but because I think that as a character, she isn't that interesting to have to tolerate for the 70 or 80 hours or whatever this expansion was. She's just not that interesting and I didn't really like her vulnerabilities, quirks, or... and this is a bit in the weeds, but, I think that the way she gets the WoL into the story is kind of outrageous?This is technically from Endwalker, the setup, so I don't mind talking about it here. Politically speaking, it seems pretty ridiculous to me that you, comparable to a divine entity in POWER LEVEL alone at this point (who is still just a humble adventurer), is being asked by Wuk Lamat, to win... a power struggle. In her home town. Halfway across the world. And the stakes are fairly minimal. I don't want to get into all the hypothetical 'what ifs' there but it bothered me, and it's covered up by one line ""it's okay I was told I can bring whoever I want"".One of your friends in the game asks you in Endwalker, ""did Wuk Lamats offer sound interesting"" and that was the wrong time to ask me because I instantly said no, no it does not, and he's like well that's okay, WoL, maybe you'll change your mind after you go there.I was strongly bored for most of the story and was not engaged by just about anything that happened. There were VERY rare moments where I felt like I liked a character here or there, such as Koana or Gulool Ja Ja, but for the most part I was... simply BORED. And that's impressive, I think. I ended up being so bored that eventually I could not take it anymore, and I grew horribly frustrated with the story, which has never happened with this video game before. I have sat through a LOT in Final Fantasy XIV, but this is the expansion - and in the MSQ no less, not even optional stuff like the entire Hildibrand questline which is also apparently divisive - this is the MSQ series where about 60% of the way through I completely lost my temper with the game and just was shouting at the game OKAY, I GET IT. MOVE ON PLEASE.This may sound extreme but I'm serious, I was just so done with it. Half of Dawntrail is green jungle and the other half is a purple nightmare, and I couldn't stand either half. I ended up hating the second half more because it was so different that it didn't even feel like I was playing the same game anymore. I think they took it way, way, WAY too far. Certain other parts of FFXIV's optional content have also... basically pushed the envelope a bit, with the setting and the look of the world and such, but THIS expansion, went WAY too far.Oh, and the writers once again showcase plainly that they really have no idea what they are doing with Krile. So why's she here? Same with the rest of the Scions - their character arcs are over, right. Why not make way for new characters...? We had a perfect jump-off point for them somewhere after Endwalker, but instead, in this expansion it's ""Avengers Assemble!"" again, basically. And don't get me wrong, I LIKE all the Scions. But they have nothing to do in this expansion's story! They are just kind of there.I had a ton of random little niggling problems with this expansion that annoyed me throughout and I could not stop thinking about them for the entire duration and many of them weren't fully answered and there were a lot of things that I saw coming for instance calling exactly who the 'real' bad guy was and so on and so forth. It was just so rote and uninteresting, and most of the locations... I mean, yeah I know Central America, it exists. I know about Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas. I am familiar with these things. I know Machu Picchu. I know em. The game sort of just presents these and expects you to be amazed without hardly dressing them up at all. Dawntrail says 'these are tacos mezcal and mate tea' and I go, yes. I know those. Am I meant to be effing impressed??? It felt for things like this, on the level of a tiny child that just learned of them on Wikipedia and is just showing .jpegs of them to adults at a get-together. Very good, tiny child? I'm not sure what you want from me.There's alpacas in this game too, and while I have never really been a big fan of them, they're okay I guess, in this game they felt especially like, they kinda were just there as a clumsy appeal to people, it didn't feel like... they belonged. Like what happened to chocobos? I thought this was Final Fantasy.In this fashion and in others, Tural seems to often forget that it is still taking place literally as an island in the world of FFXIV. Most stuff should be pretty much the same, right? Especially since they do a pretty poor job of explaining sheepishly that, oh yes Tural has always existed 'over there' and has definitely had some trade sort of kinda with Limsa, or something, it's vague about it because they don't want to address the fact an entire continent just materialalized out of nowhere basically. I can look past that somewhat, but like I said it's real strange that Tural basically comes off like an alien world for no good reason at times.All the races, that we know as Miqo'te etc. also have weird names here. It made sense for Shadowbringers. It does not make sense here to my mind and it doesn't seem to have been necessary. I never understood why they did that. There are 'small differences' between some of the beast races (who are 'allied societies' now) in this expansion and those from others, but, I don't know. Was it literally just an excuse to not have to go back and HD-ify those old races...? I don't know? I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt there somewhat, but...Then there's also some of the other things. Hrothgar females I think don't have many hair options, I don't think they can wear helmets still, same with other races, still. Lots of work yet to be done in 'modernization' of the FFXIV engine and armor assets, textures, and so on. A lot of people are upset about those things. I am too, somewhat, just that it's 2024, a couple expansions on now... there's still stuff needs fixing.So yeah, I found Dawntrail an abject disappointment. I was not expecting THAT much. All I wanted, was a small little adventure with good storytelling that doesn't waste your time, which is more precious than anything these days.

It's the exact same garbage formula every single expansion, and the massively requested improvements to basic game systems made back in A Realm Reborn are still absent 10 years later.[h3]List of stuff that absolutely sucks:[/h3]1. WoW back in 2004 had a massive world with little to no loading screens. FF14 still has instanced zones that are freaking empty. There's nothing to do in them aside from collecting freaking aether currents to unlock flying. The world in this game sucks. You don't explore it, you just teleport around for 100 hours to complete the garbage MSQ and then never go back (unless you waste your life mining nodes).2. Classes feel like absolute garbage to play. Rotations are needlessly convoluted because the devs can't figure out how to make anything matter. Melee DPS generally have 3 freaking separate abilities that function as an AUTO-ATTACK. It's filler for when you can't do anything else, and it takes THREE WHOLE BUTTONS. Then another 2 buttons for your AoE filler. That's besides all the buttons you use ONCE in a 20 minute boss fight. I have freaking carpal tunnel now; thanks game.3. The dungeons, although the bosses within are good, suck. It's a straight line through, no exploration or anything interesting. You get a few trash pulls and then a boss, rinse repeat. The big issue is that trash pulls are incredibly monotonous, unfun, and have ridiculous HP. It's just designed to inflate time, just like every other freaking mechanic. In many dungeons, you can't even pull all the trash at once because there are ""gates"" that separate you from the rest of the trash.4. Trials, although the best part of the game, have insane queue times if you are DPS. We're talking 30 minutes AT LEAST. You only get rewards for doing a random trial once per day, so no one does them. The best part of the game no one wants to play. What the heck. Give repeating rewards for these so people actually queue for them.[h3]List of INEXCUSABLE gameplay issues:[/h3]1. Glamour is freaking terrible. This is the system that allows you to customize how your clothing/equipment looks. You'd think games like WoW or GW2 have freaking NASA scientists working on them with how good their systems are by comparison. For some reason, FF14 can't figure out how to make this system even somewhat bearable. It shouldn't be difficult, but it is for them. You'll spend 30 minute spans sorting through equipment on a regular basis because of how bad this is.2. No chat bubbles? HOW IS THIS STILL NOT IN THE GAME?!3. The MSQ still wastes your time like its life depends on it. Establishing shots for areas you're already in, waiting around for talking animations to finish after you've already skipped the dialogue, waiting for your character to finish their talking animation even though THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LINES OF DIALOGUE. Go here, go there, go back, go back, go there, go fi- no... don't fight just yet... talk for another 40 minutes. Oh, you're close to the next objective? Let me teleport you to the middle of nowhere. IT IS BUILT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.4. Tanks can solo dungeon bosses. This is just stupid. DPS exists to do damage, healers exist to heal DPS. Tanks exist to be immortal and do damage. Dungeons would go faster with 4 tanks, the balance is atrocious. Watching tanks solo a boss after you die is the worst thing ever. It takes like 20 minutes, but they can do it. This game design and balance is dog tier.[h3]List of inexcusable non-gameplay issues:[/h3]1. If you buy the game, you can't download it without first paying for a subscription despite there being an infinite free trial. Depending on your internet speed, the first day of your subscription could be wasted downloading the game.2. They are freaking greedy. Paid expansions, paid monthly subscription with additional fees for extra in-game retainers, cash shop far worse than its competition (paid character appearance change, exclusive mounts, clothing, emotes, level boost, story skip, etc..). Even freaking WoW, made by the most sunken company in the history of companies has better monetization than FF14. WoW's cash shop is less egregrious, and you can completely change your appearance for free whenever you want. WHY AM I PAYING YOU MONEY, SQUENIX?!3. Servers ALWAYS have queues. Increase the freaking capacity by a bit. When there's heavy traffic (expansion launch, etc...) the game becomes a freaking nightmare to log in to. And for the love of all that is holy, KICK PEOPLE OUT OF THE GAME IF THEY ARE AFK. It makes no freaking sense that people AFK for hours are taking up server space.---There's loads of other stuff that I'm just forgetting. There is a decent game here buried under mounds of complete and utter garbage. Boss fights are really good, and probably the best in any MMO, but what you have to do to get to them is unacceptable.

Dawntrail somehow manages to be even worse storywise than that? You have to know, I was incredibly hyped for this expansion hearing we get a new cast of main characters with the scions disbanding, just for all of them to return. being forced to see krille, the twins and especially grahatia  (his character got assassinated in endwalker) again made me very dissapointed. and the new cast somehow is even worse, wuk lamat and erenvile manage to even overthrow the rebooted grahatia in terms of being annoying. When that disgusting female lion thing talks with a male voice I want to blow my head straight off and this might be the first expac where I actually skipped most cutscenes and its just because of his voice.

The battle content has improved and it is fun and enjoyable! But the problem with that is that you NEED to slog through the story to get to the fun parts. Yes, you can skip, but it's still very much a chore. There is so many ""speak to 3 npcs in the area"" quests, there's so much filler and time wasters... it was really a slog. It could have been condensed but for some reason, it needed to be the length of Endwalker, which is.. questionable. One is a finale of a 10 year story, and one is a low stakes, new adventure. And another thing that spurred me to write this review is the job design. Job design is so messy and all over the place right now, and it hurts that we have to wait 2 years for them to make changes, which it may not even be good in the end. Every class feels kind of stale right now with just an extra finisher without really changing the way they play. Some jobs had their interesting quirks snipped off because the devs want to make them easier to play. Which, well, yeah it helps newer players but there is nothing for veteran players. The developers are trying to please everyone, without their own set vision, and it's starting to hurt the uniqueness of each class. The fact that they reworked Viper just 2 weeks in, because of feedback that it was hard to play, is really uninspiring...

I am quite disappointed in Dawntrail with how they handled the story. It feels like a pretty egregious filler story and the notion of playing second fiddle to a largely flat and poorly written character in Wuk Lamat is a damn shame. I felt that Krille or Erenville had a more compelling story and arc to explore but instead the writing team went with a new character that does not have enough presence to carry an entire expansion. Given the position of the Warrior of LIght, it would be hard to continue the story without escalation sure but to put the player character in the second seat to a very uninspiring character makes the story absolutely drag along. Dawntrail is the first time ever that I felt compelled to skip scenes during the MSQ and realistically I have felt that the scenes I have skipped were largely inconsequential meaning the writing has taken a pretty bad dip. In prior expansions, cutscenes had reason and purpose thus it was important to pay attention. These scenes, I feel add no depth or narrative insight. In addition, from a gameplay perspective, the questing system at the moment is grossly outdated. It could be okay if the story was compelling enough but the actual moment to moment gameplay is quite bad. Most of the time, one does not get to use the new abilities as they level up or even have varied quest experiences. The dungeon and raid fights are well done and some of FF14s best. End game does have some credence there and i applaud the team for their work but to get there is a slog and a real shame to someone that really has enjoyed the story. Lastly, with class balance, the newest class viper became horribly gutted which was quite a shame as well which disappointed me as well.

Após o sucesso estrondoso de Shadowbringers e Endwalker, a expectativa em torno da narrativa era imensa, mas infelizmente, ela não entrega o mesmo nível de qualidade. Embora outros aspectos do jogo, como o combate, a música e as melhorias gráficas, sejam excepcionais, a história deixa muito a desejar.Um dos maiores problemas é o excesso de tramas que o jogo tenta desenvolver e resolver dentro da mesma expansão. Isso torna a narrativa confusa e fragmentada, com personagens como Krile e Erenville servindo apenas como dispositivos para avançar a história principal de Wuk Lamat, sem o devido desenvolvimento individual. Essa falta de equilíbrio prejudica a imersão e torna a história menos envolvente.Além disso, a centralização excessiva de Wuk Lamat como protagonista da expansão acaba relegando outros NPCs importantes a papéis secundários. Mesmo com a dissolução dos Scions, eles continuam presentes, mas sem relevância, aparecendo apenas em momentos convenientes para o enredo. Essa abordagem dilui o impacto emocional e narrativo que eles costumavam ter.Outro ponto fraco é o tom da história. Dawntrail tenta equilibrar momentos sombrios com uma narrativa mais leve e otimista, mas falha em fazer essa transição de forma coesa. Muitas vezes, temas mais pesados são introduzidos apenas para serem rapidamente descartados, o que prejudica a consistência e o impacto da história.

WoLs robbed of a vacation-themed story with yet another universe-ending threat.  Scions shoved into the story for trust filler and robbed of plot relevance.  WoL robbed of their one singular spotlight in all of the MSQ during the final trial by Wuk smashing her way into the arena and singularly out-dps'ing the entire party to the sound of a disney theme song blaring in your face.  At best, the story is slow, padded out, and meanderingly directionless.  At worst, it's infuriating.An idiot-ball plotline where everyone was holding the ball, where major events happen because the Scions act out of character and the fully capable WoL stands still and unmoving as important plot events happen, culminating in Wuk Lamat patting you on the back at the end and calling you a cool dude.  A story where all characters involved with exception of Wuk Lamat had no compelling reason to be there.  I'm not expecting to be the chosen-one loved-by-everybody main character, I hated that about Endwalker; just give me a reason to be there.The ""It's a setup for future expansions"" angle is bullshit given what was accomplished narratively by Dawntrail could have been done more adeptly with a different, better executed plotline such as the vacationy Tomb Raider vibe initially advertised.  As someone who didn't even really like Endwalker, finally finishing Dawntrail was both relieving and depressing.

However, the writer of Dawntrail just decided to undo all that. It was heart broken to see they fell back to tools for plot development once again. The story felt repetitive, which I was fine with in the beginning, since we are supposedly on a new adventure, a vacation. But soon I realized that was just a boring build up leading to a boring ending, and the whole story line started to feel like a replicate to previous expansions, while I promised something completely different. I was even OK with Wuk Lamat being more of a main character in the story, but I want to DO SOMETHING in the game instead of just watching her - it is a game for gods sake, can I get to have some interaction instead of just sitting in front of the screen and clicking my mouse?",1725778649,27,1,negative
76561198000128909,0,0,english,"Just to begin, if you've never played FFXIV's MSQ I still highly recommend playing up to it's conclusion in Endwalker, there's nothing else quite like it and it's largely a fantastic experience all-round...until you hit Dawntrail... (tl;dr at the bottom!)...Which is a baffling and horrendously boring experience. I don't want to cherry pick particular moments in the MSQ for critique because honestly this wasn't a death by 1000 cuts scenario, but instead it's a big, bland, block of stale bread that you need to slowly chew your way through to experience any of the gameplay content. And that's even if you're skipping cutscenes.  Final Fantasy XIV's MSQ has always been a major event and something to really look forward to, and conceptually this expansion had a ton of potential coupled with a cool premise for a fun, breezy, action filled adventure to kick start a new saga and introduce us to a brand new cast of characters. Instead the campaign is told in the most aggravatingly slow and meandering way possible, and seems to buckle down on FFXIV's worst trend of never actually committing to anything happening to it's main cast in a meaningful way, including the player character. The consequence of the poor MSQ is how it exposes just how terrible and tired FFXIV's actual questing and progression experience has become, the crutches in it's writing and over reliance on familiar tropes and established characters.Often RPG stories are full with short scenarios and side stories that all build up and lead into the overarching plot, for all the shots taken at Stormblood it was full of character moments for the player and main cast, fairly exciting action set-pieces, and had... new characters, things happening to them, hooks, even! Dawntrail instead chooses to focus it's attention largely on it's new main character Wuk Lamat, who rather unfortunately is a victim of some of the weakest of Final Fantasy's trope heavy writing and who has about 2 character bits that get repeated, and repeated... and repeated. This is conflated further by what I think is probably the largest problem: The Scions are here! Again! Despite having their character arcs neatly wrapped up at the end of the last saga and finished... they're back! For some reason! They've got nothing to do, nowhere to go, and basically stand around to remind you of things they've learned from your previous adventures and hold the narrative hostage. I understand the writer's desire to spread a positive message, but that alone does not make for a compelling story with morals and ideas that stick the landing. I hope the development team takes the right criticisms on board and fix the predictable, and boring pacing issues for their future updates and expansions, and are more bold in their storytelling next time.

76561198255298483,0,0,english,"Let me start by saying, I don't like having to write a negative review for FFXIV. I love this game, as my time played on the main game should be testament to. However, to be frank and blunt, Dawntrail deserves the thumbs down. The expansion isn't Horrible. There were a lot of things that it did okay, or even well. But the number items where the expansion just missed the mark is much higher. >> The story itself is, as many have said, fairly 'Mid' or 'Meh'. I could have genuinely accepted that and been okay with it as the start of a new arc, but Square Enix went *Hard* on promoting it with the image of a 'Vacation Expansion'. To the degree that they literally had a fake 'travel website' set up. And instead we start off on one path, and then get pulled hard into a wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey storyline that asks you to suspend your disbelief, forget what you know about established timelines and lore (that they Might? explain in future patches. Or just forget about), and face down Tron-esque Super Robot Soldiers and Almost-Literal Star Destroyers that we defeat with the power of friendship and plot armor. >> They made a big deal about some upgrades graphically, which were nice, but a lot of the game's systems are showing their age and/or outright horrible to deal with at this point. Including but not limited too: Combat / Classes (Especially for Healers), Gearing (Overmelding and it's RNG are cancer & the Tomestone Grind still has no alternative gear acquisition options), Housing (Despite the Island Sanctuary from last expansion using the same resources that generate Housing interiors), and more. There are also a number of systems that, while not inherently problematic, have just been picked up from one expansion and put down in the next with little-to-no love and just a fresh skin, and it's beginning to get tedious in some places.>> The Servers. This expansion has highlighted the fact that Square Enix, despite running one of the world's largest MMOs, has the absolute WORST servers in the market. To start it's the 'DDoS Attacks'. The thing with what they claim are DDoS attacks is either SE has p*ssed off so many people that the attacks disproportionately affect XIV as opposed to other similar sized live service games (WoW, Destiny, Guild Wars, whatever) or SE is just unwilling to put the protections in place like a Blizzard or a Bungie Or both! Or, as a final alternative, they're lying about the attacks and their servers are just incapable of supporting their player base. I actually doubt it's the later here, but it's worth mentioning as the 'other alternative'. On top of the 'DDoS' issues, the actual servers when functioning are poorly managed at best. The locking / half-unlocking of data centers and worlds has been egregious to the point that most people I know have been unable to play with their friends from different servers for the majority of the expansion so far.  'Just pay for a transfer then!', you might say. Which people would! Except when they lock a realm, it's hard locked. Even from their PAID services. But don't worry, when Papa Squenix finally does let you move to be with your friends, They'll.... still charge you full price for the chance. Until they lock it again. So make sure you're always subbed, because if you're not you can't transfer, and they might lock that server again. Watching your friends play outside through your bedroom window is fun, right?All-in-all, I do not hate this game. But the anger from a large portion of the player base is too much to ignore. Don't let the Twitterverse and the hardcore fans on copium fool you, the 'Mixed' rating this expansion has at the time of this review is not 'Because of Transphobes', it's not 'Because of Hateful People', it's not even 'Because Reddit Mad'. It's the culmination of a lot of frustration from the player base that's been mounting for some time. Square Enix can do better, and has in the past. We don't need every expansion to be 'Amazing'. We don't need the wheel re-invented every time content changes. We don't need every new zone and character to blow us out of the water and make us fall in love.But we do need better than this.",1725640273,62,0,negative
76561198960884937,0,0,english,"I think the story and characters of this expansion are the most uninteresting they have ever been in this game. The base game all the way up to Dawntrail is enjoyable. For the most part, it appeared as if each expansion wanted to outdo itself, and as you progressed with the story and over the years there were updates to previous areas or systems. Ishgardian restoration, more 'deep dungeon' content, things like that really added to the overall enjoyment I recieved from this game.  This story , as all over the place as it was, was just not enjoyable. The situations the characters find themselves presented with are all 1 to 2 ""quest"" affairs that are resolved and never spoken of again, until the last 'zone'. That one takes the whole zone to deal with, and in my opinion, ridiculously and not in a good way. I do not see this expansion as some vibrant kick off point for another 10 year saga either. It seems more like the season people point at as the downfall of a show. They employ the same tactics of killing off a character to try and tug at your heart strings, but the character 'killed' off in this way has none of the appropriate build up a certain elezen or pink garbed woman did. There is little attachment to these characters. What appears to happen here is they show they are capable of presenting a somewhat enjoyable or likeable person for all of 2 cutscenes, and commence killing them, for you to feel some kind of high stakes thing happened.. and it just comes off as incredibly campy B or C movie sci-fi action flick, made by dumb asses. And I feel like that gives incredibly campy B or C sci-fi action movies a bad name. What are described in basic terms as long standing feuds and disputes are solved by walking through a zone and clicking on sparkly nodes. I found myself struggling on a first playthrough of the MSQ to maintain a veiled hint of interest. Think of centuries long disputes in regions like the Middle East for example. Throw in some modern politician, wearing Native American battle armor and a giant axe that is as loud and obtuse as the main character of this expansion, make them meet with the head of one tribe or another, make them eat gyros from some other tribe and well, hundreds of years of fighting and territorial disputes all fixed. That is the feeling this entire expansion, from the last mission of Endwalker to the last Mission of Base Dawntrail gave me. I have had personal experience dealing with longstanding disputes myself, and feel like the people trying to write this kind of story either don't care or are not aware of the minor details or feel like the people they want to see this 'story' happen are too stupid or ignorant to understand that resolution is not a happy party festival with tacos and jazz music. Almost like a form of brain damage watching it play it like that. I don't want to spoil the game or story. i have no gripe with a specific character or cast member, I just feel like whole experience is sour and thoroughly un-enjoyable. There are 'grim dark' moments toward the end of expansion, that have all the emotional gripping power of watching Bozo the Clown read off lottery ticket numbers between Saturday morning cartoons.  Here is bozo himself for reference : https://youtu.be/C3WxRzH7sCg?si=DlzfYOZH9bgZfb51 This in comparison to something like this.. :  https://youtu.be/K1PL9vKum5k?si=F1cZiX8tXlRNElSR I have had serious detachment from the story of this game for a while, but this expansion kind of seared my ability to take any of it seriously, even in a suspension of disbelief kind of way.

It is no real stretch to say that battle mechanics is basically a wacky game of dodgeball, so they think adding more crap to dodge is fun. Maybe for a cat.

If you suffer through the main story quest line (MSQ) Dawntrail does offer new mechanics in fights, but this early into the expansion these interesting figths are few and far between.Dawntrail is a story about everyone else but the warrior of light: side character more or less replace the player character. This might be interesting if side characters would be well rounded personalities with meaningful story progression... this is unfortunately not the case. Ultimately player spends about 80% of the expansion just wandering around without proper reason to do anything. The beginning part of the expansion is largely pointless and horribly dragged out. Quality control also failed with English translation. Characters periodically misspell names and places. Also the voice acting causes secondhand embarrassment at times. Japanese voice acting is better but still not great. When poor story design is combined with poor voice acting the result is not what I have learnt to expect from Final Fantasy. In the future when Scenario Skipping Items become available Dawntrail is good place to use them. I'd say that the somewhat negative reception Dawntrail has gotten is well justified and hope this is not the new normal.While Dawnrail trials and raids do offer new mechanics to challenge the player, this early into the expansion there simply isn't much to do.

76561198030249375,0,0,english,"While Dawntrail harbors some of FFXIV's best dungeons, bosses, and raids to date, its story is clumsy and inoffensive at its best, and actively destructive to the cast and player's character integrity at its worst, which is where it finds itself worryingly often.While Dawntrail held interesting promise for the WoL and Scions to slip into a more leisurely mentor role, no meaningful mentorship winds up occuring, and instead those characters are relegated to powerless, ineffectual, nodding heads, nodding along to a strangely disorganized and incongruent plot that often forgets the very rules and premises it establishes mere quests - or sometimes even a few lines - prior. This is accompanied by ineffectual villains and plot-initiatives that seem to be leading towards some promise, only to fizzle and fray out into nonsense, that is if they are not outright forgotten about or go unacknowledged instead.Instead of being harmlessly bland, Dawntrail becomes a frustrating slog that undermines both old and new cast, including the increasingly infamous Wuk Lamat who sadly suffers not because of the archetype of her character but at the hand of lousy writing and tiring overuse and imbalance by the time the expansion's second half unfurls.This game is notorious for its turnarounds, and hopefully the team can acknowledge Dawntrail's missteps into something excellent for its next expansion, but unless that turnaround begins rearing its head in the post-expansion story update patches, Dawntrail would be better off skipped for now to save the $40 and subscription.",1725511244,15,0,negative

76561198195740803,0,0,english,"Feels like the story hit the top of the mountain in Shadowbringers, climbed a similar mountain but not as tall in Endwalker, and then stepped on a kid's sand castle and called it Mount Everest in Dawntrail. Easily the worst DLC for storytelling. Everyone already knows how bad Wuk Lamutt's voice is and how her character is even worse. Literally a white person putting on a fake accent. Square must have known what they were doing making the facial animations for Wuk Lamat so boring because it perfectly matches the delivery of her lines. Having the most monotone boring voice you could imagine during important cutscenes of your fanfiction isn't helping your review numbers go back in the positive side. If you still want to sit through the story for the sake of what came before, do yourself a favor and switch to japanese. Easier on the ears that way.The story is also worth being called false advertising, as I was told Dawntrail would be a summer adventure with my closest companions and instead got a babysitting session I didn't even get paid for. Half of my friends didn't even show up. Getting sidelined for the writers' OC is not how you sell your playerbase on a narrative. The entire story could have happened the same way with or without the WoL or scions ever showing up because its obvious how much they want you to love Wuk Lamat. She interjects herself into every single conversation and suffers from an incurable naivete. It makes you try and recall if the world that we just saved had any real people or problems that couldn't be solved with a simple pat on the back or a reassuring smile. I would love to see Wuk Lamat try and fail to talk to someone who lost their entire family to Garlemald siege about how they should just shake hands and let bygones be bygones. As well as giving her more screen time than almost every other character combined. Oh and I thought Krile would get to maybe possibly do something this expansion but I guess taking off her hood and grabbing a paintbrush is good enough to the writers.From a story standpoint the DLC is a failure, and while some people focus more on glamour or endgame savage content, a vast majority of the playerbase is buying the DLC for the story. To see what comes next and what will follow. The only argument any of the defenders of the main story seem to have is any criticism of the story or the characters is transphobic. as just a cover for their lack of any real points in favor of this trash heap. They tote around Wuk Lamat as a much needed (never wanted) bundle of joy in contrast to the more mature themes of DLCs past, when that just speaks even more to her inherent naive nature.Other than the story, the vast amount of additional content that came with Dawntrail is really hit or miss depending on the player. Most people like Pictomancer and enjoy it while most of the playerbase, myself included, didn't like or click with how Viper was put together. Enough so that Square Enix had to change the entire class to something too simple for those who were mastering the job before and ended up dropping it all together. People like their 1-2-3's. The job changes as a whole are a mess to deal with as how the changes are received changes depending on the person. Some people like what their job got, some people didn't like what theirs got, some switched and some stuck with their favorites. It only seems like the new features each job got are a bit lacking. The only changes a numerous amount of the jobs got was just adding another big finisher button to the end of their combo along with some QoL updates (looking at you, Red Mage).Another thing Square added was multiple dyes on a single piece of gear. This sounds like a great addition, giving the glamourheads even more customization to make their character look exactly how they want to. But instead for some reason, Square Enix decided to make it so that you don't get to choose what part of the gear get dyed. This leads to many issues of having to settle for less when the perfect gear you got doesn't dye the right way and you end up with not much of a point to adding the feature at all.Glossing over the other things, the graphics update looks great, but the land and scenery of Tural are a mixed bag. Some areas look great while others are boring, barren wastelands. All the usual departments did their job right. The music is fine and the dungeons are surprisingly great, yadda yadda. Mostly because the only department that got any kind of massive shifts in them was the writers.At least Estinien got to have fun and Koana gets to build as many I-95s as he wants all over Tural.I hope we never have to deal with Tural and Wuk Lamutt ever again.",1725254448,64,0,negative

People like Kate, of Lead Localization engaging in blatant nepotism to get her friend, an absolute amateur VA to play the most important character of the expansion, while Kate tweets about how ""i want people to shut up about characters they dont like, no, youre wrong, that character is good"", which really is a haunting line when put in the context of how bad Wuk Lamat is universally regarded as.These people cannot safeguard the future of this game, and Yoshida seemingly is blind to the many issues that simply make this game less than it was just one expansion ago. Beforehand, you used to get a great story and then great gameplay from each expansion, this was THE ""good story MMO"", but now, you get less bang for your buck. While the gameplay is now better, I simply cannot in the right mind recommend an expansion of a game that used to do two big things really well but now can only do one. Expansions shouldnt trend down in quality, and this is the first one to do so. People are quick to bring out Stormblood, but that expansion had some of the most content, some of the best raids, some of the best post patch stories, and the BEST abilities and class fantasy of any expansion EVER. HALF of the story of SB sucked, and people give it shit to this day, now imagine what DT does to the image of this game? It is SCARY to love this game right now, because if Dawntrail and Endwalker post patches are a trend, this game simply will have less to offer than it did in the past for the next decade. A game that used to have amazing story and amazing gameplay will now only have the gameplay, and thats a problem, because every single facet of the gameplay is tied to story, from dungeons to raids.No, its not TERRIBLE. Its just less than it was. Which is fucking ridiculous considering how much time, money and love people invest into this game. This game is literally Squares golden goose that is keeping the company alive through flops like Forspoken, and yet it doesnt feel like any of the PRICEY costumes in the mogstation are being reinvested back in the game.This game needs drastic measures to change, and fast. If this is what awaits us for the next 10 years, were truly screwed, and the game will slowly bleed out players as the MSQ becomes a bigger and bigger barrier of entry for new players, as it takes longer to complete, and becomes more and more boring with each passing xpac.Simply put, they have until the next expansion to fix it, or else im out. I dont think this is terrible or unplayable, but the thing is: Wow was never unplayable either, it just eroded in quality slowly until it became a grey slop that was a shadow of its former self. I refuse to let my love and good memories of this game be tainted by desperately trying to perform CPR in it while begging the devs to bring us back to the glory days, like it happened to other WoW players, who slowly lost their love and beautiful memories of an otherwise amazing game. The same way i refused to taint my beautiful memories of my time in Ragnarok Online, by playing the gacha mobile garbage Gravity releases every year bearing that franchises name, in a desperate, vain attempt to tap into nostalgia and great times past. Learning to let go is honestly the healthiest mindset when it comes to beloved franchises nowadays, and that is honestly kind of sad.'Twas a grand, glorious dream we shared.Of a world united.

I enjoyed Wuk Lamat in 6.55, but her omnipresence in 7.0 is diabolical. I found myself, for the very first time in the ten years I have been playing FFXIV, rushing through dialogue and clipping voiced cut scenes so I could get back to playing the game - which was a struggle in itself given that during the MSQ we're barely presented with the opportunity to actually play the game. It's a mess of ""Talk to Wuk Lamat"" > go here ""Talk to Wuk Lamat"" > do X thing for Wuk Lamat > ""Talk to Wuk Lamat"" > ... you get it.Normally, I'm excited and on the edge of my seat waiting for the big reveal and finale of the MSQ. That wasn't the case here. I felt bored, impatiently waiting for the credits to role so that I could finally do something fun, like the dungeons and trials which have been amazing so far - a bright spot in an otherwise terrible expansion.  I will say, though, that the level 100 trial was a disappointment for me. I didn't enjoy Wuk Lamat breaking through the ceiling for several reasons, but mostly because I'm tired of seeing that gimmick. We saw it in Shadowbringers (Thancred breaks through during Hades) and again in Endwalker (Zenos/Shinryu headbutting his way in during Endsinger). I am begging Square, please stop. It was awesome the first time, but now we just expect it and it's tired.

In Dawntrail however? Talk with Wuk Lamat > talk to 3 npcs > talk with Wuk Lamat > Talk with Wuk Lamat again > Talk with Wuk Lamat once again. And this happens multiple times, 10+ times, sometimes without anyone moving at all nor cutscene.

В это время, пиктомансер, от которого я не ждал вообще ничего и про который практически ничего не говорили во время сольных выступлений по продаже аддона от Йоши Пи: интересные механики, прикольный визуал, мобильный, интересно играть и крутить ротации. Ну т.е. за него натурально приятно играть.Самая большая причина по которой ""не рекомендую"" этот аддон - это ввод в игру и наличие на протяжении всего аддона блядcкого вук ламата. Этот ублюдoк не привносит и не делает в игре ничего кроме раздражения. Каждый раз, когда я вижу его на экране - это инста скип. Жаль, что существуют некоторые катсцены, которые нельзя с ним скипнуть. Нехаризматичный, клишированный, раздражающий кусок бесполезного дeрьма. Буквально вырезать его из игры, и аддон становится на 50% лучше. И самое смешное, что абсолютно ничего из сюжета, сценария, повествования, импакта на мир не поменяется. Просто один гнидон испортил мне все впечатления от аддона.В общем и целом, я надеюсь в следующий аддон, если он вообще будет, они по настоящему вложатся, и он не будет проходным шлаком как вот это вот недоразумение. И не дай Бог я еще раз увижу фурри-клоуна-гея от соя инкорпорейшен или что-то подобное в игре.",1725029003,6,2,negative

She takes time and development away from other characters like Krile. While Krile does get a vulnerable moment in the story it ultimately last for half an hour and lacks the proper impact it needed.

After the whole trial non-sense part was over, I felt this is where the story starts to really fall apart, the whole story of Zoraal Ja becoming king, and Sphere was the real villain felt so rushed, everything happend so fast and sudden that I could have no real feelings when Zoraal Ja was defeated nor cared about any of the characters like Otis and meeting his endless version of him.

Yes, Wuk Lamat. I understand how important learning cultures is to you. Can you please stop repeating yourself The story itself wasn't bad, if not predictable and already done before. You have the growth of a leader shown in Stormblood in the first half (Lyse -> Wuk Lamat). Then in the latter, having a friendly character turn antagonist with some sympathetic story/dungeon (Meteion -> Sphene), with a final scene in an arena beyond reality where the antagonist is defeated (Meteion/Zenos -> Sphene), like in Endwalker. Of course, people have compared the story to past expansions. ""Lyse had better development than Wuk Lamat"", etc.. I am also of the belief that Dawntrail has not done well. But I mainly want to talk about Wuk Lamat's EN VA.From her Super Saiyan duel/fight with Bakool Ja Ja & co., to the death of her father, to her appearance in the final fight against Sphene, the EN VA struggled and failed to deliver every single line that completely ruined the scene for me. Compared to what I have seen from other voice actors, I have never heard a more flat, emotionless, careless voice, which is extremely bad considering Wuk Lamat is in 90% of the cutscenes. ""sphene. listen to me."" *GETS CRUSHED BY A GIANT ROBOT HAND* ""but if there's no truly other way to resolve this, then face me. i guess."" Then I listen to the JP VA have sounds of struggle, more passion and more desperation. It feels much more in the moment, and more anime. Which should be the case... in what is essentially an anime game.This is the case in many of Wuk Lamat's big story points, where she sounds the same in every single cutscene. It makes me feel more appreciative of other characters, particularly Bakool Ja Ja and Koana, who express great amounts of emotion in scenes where there is a period of change (Bakool Ja Ja vs. the truth of the blessed) (Bakool Ja Ja's haughty confident ego vs. Bakool Ja Ja feeling good about saving people) (Koana's stoicism vs. Koana's true wants/emotions) (Koana vs. the kidnapping of Wuk Lamat).

Jobs are still the same and pending changes in 8.x (lol). Enough was said regarding these in other reviews.Now the elephant in the room:Square Enix's bad decision-making and its trend of ""going global"" (read Americanisation) has felt stronger this expansion. The same malign influence that had a hand in the creation of the disaster that is known as Forspoken has seeped into this game. The move to hire English VAs using an L.A studio has made them enter the American ecosystem and suffer its implications...The result was an amateur VA (who claims to be of Latino descent) landing the role of the most important character and NPC in this expansion's story. As if the writing for the NPC and story was not dreadful enough, the VA had no range or ability to express emotions adequately and felt incredibly miscast. In fact, it is very much so; the VA was struggling to masquerade as a Latino woman which is proven by the fact that the the VA slips and stumbles whenever the NPC is required to yell or speak loudly. In fact, in the climax of the final battle, just as the player character beats the antagonist, the NPC intervenes just to ""yell quietly"" and sabotage the PC's triumphant moment to remind everyone that the true main character of this subpar story was not and is not the player. Tl;dr: the substandard writing combined with the horribly miscast (EN only), omnipresent, and badly written NPC on which the expansion's story lives on or dies resulted in a very poor and unpleasant experience.P.S: That same VA has been slandering people on social media and calling for certain voice actors from other video games to ""step down"" for niche and impractical ideological reasons and overall being divisive. As if that was not enough, there is no separation between the VA and the NPC Wuk Lamat on social media, injecting one's personal life and views into a character that is owned by Square Enix and acting as you are one and the same while being publicly defamatory and hostile against the community for voicing their criticism of the expansion is completely unprofessional and endangering the reputation of Square Enix and potentially damaging its assets.",1724542228,32,1,negative

Certain zones (trust me, you'll know EXACTLY what I mean) are like, what is this doing here, and why?!Like comparing it to Heavensward, which has great thematic consistency almost through to the end, or Stormblood which had a bit of ridicule for the split between the two areas, or Shadowbringers, again another great example of CONSISTENT themes throughout, it is easy to see the issue.Endwalker makes many of the same mistakes, and was panned for them specifically.

76561198069014889,0,0,swedish,"Plenty of people have already made long explainations in their reviews on what is good and what is bad with the expansion.My take is the same and no different:Gameplay, such as Duties and Trials (Dungeons and Raid Bosses) are great.Music and visual design, sometimes doesn't work, other times is stellar at the most.The story however ruins everything; it is horrendously told, much worse than ARR. As the Duties and Trials are locked behind the story, you will be forced to engage with the most childish and stupid kind of story telling, with the most braindead characters in a very, very long time. You will find it very easy to skip the cutscenes, unless you really want to see how bad it really is.Yes there is one character that stands out, but that character is not the only one poorly written or has story around them that is just pure agony; this might as well have been written by children in how juvenile it is sometimes.Everything else is fine, but because you are forced to either sit through the Main Quest you may find yourself wanting to quit the game or skip what is basically 80-90% of the expansion. At least the Raid Series seems to be a banger... if you didn't have to sit through hours of the main story first, I doubt it's too long, but damn it felt like an eternity to sit through... not play, sit. It's basically a visual novel (a horrible one) with a few bits of combat in between.Just avoid the expansion like the plague or skip everything, you're not missing out on anything but the context of why you fight some characters and that's it.P.S: One last thing, unless there was something I missed about Souls and Alexandria and unless they retcon it in future updates, Sphene is the absolute worst, most unredeemable villain in FF14 and Wuk Lamat is the greatest idiot in existence for forgiving here.Here's a hint: if you think about it for more than five seconds, you realize that Sphene basically deletes people from existence.

76561198052037268,0,0,english,"[Spoilers for Dawntrail if you haven't completed the MSQ yet.]I will start this by saying I personally enjoyed my playthrough of Dawntrail. In fact, I even rank it top 3 of most enjoyable, behind Shadowbringers and Heavensward. However, once that initial ""this was fun"" moment for me passed, I do what I normally do and look over the whole story and go ""Was it actually any good though?"" That was when I realized that the reason I enjoyed Dawntrail when I played through it was because I completely turned my brain off to a certain cat girl character before I even finished the first two zones because I knew immediately what kind of character the devs were going to try and shove onto me for the entire MSQ. Unraveling the rest from there I wound up with the unsurprising answer of: ""Wow, Dawntrail's story is abysmal.""While MOST of the music and the battle content were both quite enjoyable to me, ultimately what gets people playing this game is the Main Story Quest, or MSQ, and the MSQ for Dawntrail is as I stated above; Abysmal. MANY plot holes plague it from start to finish, with many constantly having you ask ""But why?"" over and over and over. Remember Ihih'hana? Apparently nobody else in  Kozama'uka does except Wuk Evu and the Hanu Hanu elder and they just decided to...never tell their village why taking the festival seriously was so important...BUT HEY WUK LAMAT FIGURED IT OUT SO NOW SHE IS OUR SAVIOR!!! Yes, the name has been dropped: Wuk Lamat.You're either going to love this character or hate her, and the ENTIRE EXPANSION rides on that single fact: if you love her, you'll probably love Dawntrail. If you hate her, you're going to have an awful time. People might joke she is ""furry Naruto"" but that is actually somewhat correct; if you take away any challenges and growth the actual Naruto character had during their series. Wuk Lamat is insanely one-dimensional. So much so you know her ENTIRE character before you even leave the beginning level 90 areas, and from start to finish through the entire MSQ, her ""Ninja Way"" of ""I REALLY love peace and happiness!"" gets her through literally anything and everything in her path in the most perfect ways possible. Who knew all it took to stop a centuries long eugenics project that an entire species of people have been dealing with was just give them some seeds to grow something other then bananas along with the power of friendship???Even the CHARACTERS are all made to accommodate Wuk Lamat. A child overhears that you are going to kill their father? Just say you want to get to know them and then share a meal with them and watch as they don't care anymore AND want to be best friends with you too! You like spunky and sassy Alisaie? Well you'll be glad to know she lost all of that and becomes a generic ""Yes Man"" for Wuk Lamat! Remember when the devs hyped up Krile as having a BIG part in this MSQ? Sorry; I hope you enjoy Krile getting a basic nothing-burger story pulled from the ""generic plot"" hat because Wuk Lamat needed a few more hours of screentime talking about how much she loves Peace and happiness and understanding people for the hundredth time.Despite the story constantly telling us of Wuk Lamat's growth as a character, never once is it shown: from beginning to end, she acts the EXACT same way, and the story rewards her every step of the way for it. Wuk Lamat is the definition of a ""Black Hole Sue"" character, and the ENTIRE story caters to that, constantly making it so everything she does resolves in the most perfect way possible at all times for her, and that all characters either exist to validate her one-dimensional character, or ""build"" her character through ""confrontation"". She even gets her own Zenos AND Emet Selch characters to confront!...One who is literally written to be a Saturday morning villain names Edgy McEdgelord with Daddy issues who is suppose to be her ""big rival"", and another who she becomes best friends with even though she wants to genocide our world!I won't even dig into the English Voice Acting, but if you want to play but cannot handle the english; switch to Japanese voices, or even the French/German voices, it will make it slightly more manageable.I could go on and on, about more plot holes and strange music choices and character decisions, but I will just end it with this: I personally enjoyed MY playthrough of Dawntrail. However, my personal enjoyment doesn't suddenly mean all of the issues just vanish and don't suddenly exist for other players. Regardless of how much I enjoyed my playthrough, with both the music and battle content: critically thinking about this entire story, which IS the main selling point for this series, from start to end just shows it is an insult to the players and everything that came before it, and I cannot recommend Dawntrail based on what MSQ story we were given. Even Endwalker, as much as I hated that expansion with both it's MSQ and post MSQ stories, was better then this.Dawntrail is literally a speedrun of ""FF14's greatest hits collection of the past several expansions"" centered around someone's single fursona OC, without ANY of the buildup or payoff.So SMILE, and let the rainbow sing...Because Wuk Lamat needs you to talk to 3 more people for her before speaking with her again.

Even if you were indifferent you will feel the fatigue. Wuk is all at once the least interesting person in any given room with the least to say and the least qualified to rule, only the Dawnservant due to pure nepotism, given the one non-relative of the current ruler had to win a whole tournament to compete it's fair to say that it's her sole qualification. Without any actual special skills and a total lack of knowledge of her own lands, despite the other siblings seemingly able to go out and do their own thing it really does seem like they just stared at a wall for so many years. Even most forms of exposition are taken up by Erenville leaving Wuk to speak and say nothing. 'Speak To Wuk Lamat' as a quest objective gave me more dread than 'Return To The Waking Sands'.The whole story warps around the black hole that is the cat princess. Other characters who join in on the journey take a back seat leading to their own plot arcs being overshadowed or rushed to get back to her. Krile suffering the most and then some. Wuk's english voice acting is well known for lacking quality direction and a certain line close the ending was delivered so poorly it's become something of a meme. Despite this Wuk takes so much time from others that it ruins others characters arcs. Implications of other Scions competing never truly happens which was a let down to see them interact with some sparring at least or see some development, but that might be time that the audience isn't going 'Where's Cat Poochie?'. If Wuk is the 'Main Character' of the expansion them being so bland and annoying is incredibly damning, and getting Bleach level power ups when the plot demands it through the justification of 'Resolve' does have the implication several beloved characters just didn't want to live as much as this annoying cat.Even the broader plot suffers from a similar problem Endwalker had of a game of two halves. The front half involving interactions with the various groups of Tural feels incredibly underbaked. Many of them have a whole entire group wide personality trait and their issues get resolved all too quickly. The second half is a little better but by then fatigue set in. For a 'New Start to The Story' the exact same ending thread of the final dungeon being a vision of the past about the big bad of that time really doesn't bode well. The gameplay is the same as ever if a little trickier. For a new start and saga a slight evolution of the main gameplay and an utter botch of a story doesn't bode well for the future.

Nope lol, we're actually npc for this expansion, guess thats one way to chill... just dont have your character in this expansion at all. I've never wanted to skip a part of MSQ ever in any part of FFXIV, not even during ARR. 90-95 you could literally skip it after hearing Wuk Lamat say she wants to use the power of friendship to bring peace because thats all you're going hear for 10+ hours. You genuinely wouldn't miss anything. Did I forget to mention that Wuk Lamat got seasick or airsick again. No, well I hope you enjoy that plot line for 5+ hours. Wuk Lamat drama on her VA, I genuinely couldn't care less about. The VA was done poor, but  I'm more concern with how the character itself directed by the game was done insanely poorly. She plays like a Naruto character that wants to become hokag- sorry Dawnservant that has the usefulness of Sakura and has more screentime than Naruto in Naruto. Statistically if you talk to someone in this expansion there is a 33% chance (147 quest asking to talk to her) it was Wuk Lamat and 20% chance voice acting wise she is talking and a 100% chance she is yapping over someone else's dialogue so nobody else can talk. Genuinely never seen a character in FFXIV get this much screen time. I suppose this is a new idea, but lets not do this again. Send her straight to Lyse gulag never to be seen again so I dont have to see her pop up when the new end of time comes like she's Zenos in final trial screaming about the power of friendship and having it work on the boss. Like hell even the antagonist go through more growth than her and they got friendship no jutsu out of their entire character, just like how the scions and you're character become her minions that forgot who they are and what their characters were. I swear this expansion was a fanfic because the scions were unrecognizable, they just didn't act themselves.I don't care that my character ended up being some npc that was utterly useless. The pacing was poor, the screentime for other character was atrocious. I dont need to be the main character, but if you're going to force one on me at least make the character interesting, not some generic main character in Shounen Jump, but don't even commit to the shounen Genre.

Not surprising though considering she was 90% of the expansion since she yapped over everyone else and friendship no jutsu the rest. I'm insanely disappointed for the talk about going to battling it out with scions that was discussed end up being a nothingburger cuz suqare enix chickened out of it. 4/10 expansion where 5/10 is ARR cuz at least ARR build stuff up that was interesting.Final note let me give you a tally on the yap meter of how much she talks7000 words for Wuk LamatErenville the freaking narrator got 2knext closest to Wuk Lamat was 3.5kKrile you know the scion this expansion was suppose to be about got barely above 1k wordsAll of the scions combined have less than 3k, so that was including Krile's 1.1kSo if we ignored that one character with 3.5k and combined all the characters in dawntrail ALL the other ones, they would have less words than Wuk Lamat.

76561198079673529,144213,10187,english,"Generally disappointed with this expansion. Between having to have Wuk constantly being the main character (derogatory) and the half-baked graphical update, I cannot in good faith say that this is a decent expansion, let alone an ""okay"" expansion. The areas are too big. Even with flying unlocked, it takes forever to traverse from one end to another.I do not understand the point of updating the face models, but leaving everything below the neck extremely polygonal. They updated the body textures too, which is pointless when the models are still stuck in the past. I feel like the tron-esque designs are very out of place, especially considering that it's not too far from the first expansion (map wise, it's very close west). The music is sub-par, and the voice acting is atrocious. Some lines sound like they were recorded from the voice actor's phone. I'd like to talk more about how much I hate the voice acting, but I fear that I will be targeted for wrongthink.Back to the graphics, the world textures are barely updated, and looks very jarring when you have a high quality textured table on a floor that you can count the pixels on. The new lighting system is decent, but the shadows are still very low quality. The lighting now passes through large hats, meaning if you have a light directly on top of you, the top half of your face will be lighted and the bottom will be in the shade, which doesn't make sense.Edit: 2024/09/14The shadows, are actually decent, it's just the ""soft shadows"" setting is very poorly implemented, and that some areas (namely Gridania's market board area) still use the old lighting system for no reason.Square Enix said that there's issues with the faces, and the main issue everyone seems to have is the philtrum actually exist now. In my opinion, the philtrum looks pretty good, and is a lot better than the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome philtrums we had before. The main issue I have is that my character's lips no longer have the same shape.I really wish they would apologize for this expansion.",1724186946,22,0,negative

I absolutely loved the world and story of FF14, but I am deeply disappointed. After much deliberation, I've decided to cancel my subscription. Thank you for everything up until now.The main issues I had were: 1) The negative changes to the scenery and Hyur faces after the graphic update, 2) Everything about Uklamat, and 3) The boring storyline. The only positives were the music and the novelty of the new areas.1) Changes to Scenery and Hyur Faces after the Graphic UpdateDecreased Quality of SceneryI used to love the scenery in FF14 and often took photos while wandering around as part of my daily life, but that’s no longer possible. After the update, many of the landscapes experienced dramatic negative changes. Not only the lighting, but also extremely unnatural fog and haze effects were added, making it impossible to enjoy the beautiful views anymore. Did the graphics team even check this? Please tell me. How could an update make things so disappointing? Many Warriors of Light have posted in the forums under ""Opinions, Requests, and Discussions on the Graphic Update,"" so please check it out.Decreased Quality of Hyur FacesAlthough Hyurs may be a minor character type, the drastic change was so shocking that I couldn't play for over a month after purchasing the DLC. The strange shadows on their faces, the overemphasis on tear bags, and the discomfort around the mouth and philtrum are very sad. I used to take a lot of close-up screenshots, but now, I hardly do. Once again, what exactly did the graphics team check to determine that this update was equal to or better than before? I demand a detailed explanation.2) Everything about Wuk LamatI won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but it’s truly awful. If you say it’s because of the character setting, then that’s that, but I cannot stand the appearance, personality, attitude, speech, and motivations. I couldn't empathize with them at all.3) The Boring StorylineI won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but it’s far more tedious than the Realm Reborn storyline. I almost fell asleep multiple times and ended up skipping almost everything. Unlike the previous DLCs, where I was so engrossed in the story, I was surprised by how overwhelmingly sleepy and bored I was this time.Can you please stop relying so heavily on cutscenes? Players don't want to only watch cutscenes; they want to immerse themselves in the story. Cutscenes are just a means to an end, not the end itself. With an already poor story that fails to engage, the constant cutscenes were just too much. There were multiple moments where I thought, ""Let me control the character and experience this as a mini-game!"" Instead, all we got was following, following, accompanying, accompanying, and more zoom-ins. If you can't create a good story, could you at least come up with new ways to play?It’s really sad.

To start of on why lets talk about hte elephant in the room or should i say cat WUK Lamat personally at first i loved her character and was excited to explore the depth this character help but when i went to dive into the deep end i was met with a face full of concrete which is to say Wuk Lamat has the depth of a kiddy pool when i comes to Character growth She starts off as a Peace and Taco loving Cat that is desperate to prove her self and evolved into the NEVER WRONG Peace and Taco loving Cat that Proved herself in no point in the story was she faced with a challange that she couldnt over come with her view of ""if i learn about you past i can change you into someone who becomes my friend"" her hyper positively was OK at first the problem is IT NEVER ENDED even when she faced TWO of the most heart breaking moments where her views SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHALLANGED she instead made a SINGULAR EXCEPTION. when her brother layed there dying he put how he felt out there and SHE TOLD HIM HE WAS WRONG at no point did she try to understand her brothers feelings of being placed with a world of expectations and being told HE WOULD BE AIR TO THE THRONE only for is father to constantly dot on his adoptive sister. (ps just realised this but she was more sympathetic to a genocidal Queen then her own Brother)I would've been able to over look this if at any point in the story the was a point where we stopped travelling with Wok lamat but the one time we separate from her she re enters the story and takes hold of and doesn't let go i dont know what square enix was thinking when the decided to give Wuk Lamat more screen time then our own character in the MSQ story. I personally feel as though i (As the WoL) could have been taken out of the story and not much would've chnaged every time it felt like something started to need only my touch there was Wuk lamat to steal the spotlight (ie The Final Trail) i can comfortable that the over arching story of dawntrail COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD but in my opinion they pushed wuk lamat way too hard and if the eased off and maybe gave her less scenes and made her struggle a bit she could've been a better character but because they didnt she will forever be compared to Lyse as an Expansion WreckerNow to talk about the good in this expansion EVERYTHING ELSEso ill make this brief as i haven't done too much but the Dungeon environment was so well built i found myself wanting to stop and take in the dungeon itself and they did this for every dungeon. Next Trails and Bosses, HOLY SHIT these things were amazing some of the hardest non-Extreme boss fights to date with amazing battles that kept me on my toes and hooked into the fight at all time i wanna almost say that these bosses were better then some of my all time favourites. Finally the overworld, MAN what else is there to say then this is BEAUTIFUL each area felt extremely unique and large biggest to date if im not wrong and despite their size they dont lack in detail i am definitely gonna spent a few days just exploring these places to find all the cool spots.Overall this expansion could have been the best even beating out SHB but the writing team really fumbled when it came to the exacution of charatcers and the overall theme of the story i wish we had spent less with Wuk Lamat and more with Erenville and Krile, The ladder being what i was most upset about as i had thought going into this expansion that the ladder half might focus on her looking at the path her Grandfather took and to find out why he was in Tuliyolal but that didnt happen these two character were relgated to the side and only came out to shine very briefly every now and then so with all that said i cant give this expansion higher then a 4/10 and its only better then SB due to how amazing the other content that was added was.

Wuk Lamat was almost nowhere to be seen in the marketing. It was always focused on the WoL, Krile, and Erenville, all of which took a back seat to this dumb ""peace and friendship"" lion that shows up and recruits us without any resistance. This was not the ""summer vacation exploring a new land"" that was advertised to us. It was not a ""low stakes"" story in the slightest despite not being *as high* stakes as Shadowbringers/Endwalker. The potential ""conflict between scions"" boiled down to a single interaction in the first dungeon.For a game that everyone sold me on trying because the story was so good(and it was, despite some major issues I have with Endwalker's pacing and plot holes), Dawntrail is a major flop that made me take another look at DRAGONFLIGHT in WoW and think ""perhaps I judged you too harshly.""

Mt. Gulg >There's a lot of controversy surrounding Wuk Lamat's VA and the performance she gives. In some parts of the story she does great, but then in some other important areas where she really needed to put emotion out there, she doesn't. It's jarring and feels like a first take. There's one moment in particular that sticks out (I'll remove names and try to keep it as spoiler free as possible): [spoiler] Wuk Lamat appears in a boss fight and says ""<boss>, listen to me."" and it seems like she's supposed to be yelling, emotional, and really trying to get through to the boss, but the line is so quiet and calm. It actually takes away from the fight. [/spoiler] I have seen people make a plethora of memes of this scene for this exact reason.

Would've liked to see a bit more bravery from SE, but this feels far safer and less exciting in regards to changes than ever.----For a bit more detail- Changes to classes were few and far between. The changes we did see mostly simplified classes further, or otherwise restricted them (see Black Mage) to enforce simplicity. The MSQ continues a rigid structure of N1/N3/N5/N7/N9/LevelCap Dungeons, with Trials at N3, N9, and LevelCap. The raids will be following the exact same structure. While the gameplay feel for bosses/trials/raids etc. has improved, it's disappointing they've taken the safe route of providing exactly the amount of content we'd come to expect and nothing more, with no notable twists. Gearing also appears to be the same, with everything being just stats, obtained in all the same ways as before.Outside the ""scheduled"" content provided in the MSQ, the actual MSQ quests have fewer solo duties than ever. There are many moments where your character is present, but not doing anything- It hardly feels like a game. With content being so easily predictable and spread 4 months apart for 2 years, you already know what to expect. It's very difficult to get excited. I appreciate we'll be getting another Deep Dungeon and a Eureka/Bozja successor, but I have no reason to believe they'll be ""brave"".

Spoilers below.Let me up front with this; the game play for the dungeons, trials, and raids has be wonderful; its the writing for the story and the quality of the voice work and sound mixing that has made this a negative review expansion for me. First off the writing is very ""Shonen-esque"" with new main character Wuk Lamat. Sena delivers some great voice work here and there; no question, but the lines she has to repeat many times either verbatim or some variation of the lines just grinds on you after awhile. I will also admit I that do not care for Shonen anime style characters that are bubbly and naive and the center of attention. What ends up happening is that DT puts all the focus from beginning to end of 7.0 on Wuk, and its just an overload. I will also admit... that her showing up in that one CS did annoy me. Mainly because it was our big shindig and she just comes in... that and now we'll have to see that CS every time it shows up on the roulette.Secondly the voice work as a whole is all over the place. Most of the main cast are great and the mixing is fine. But then you get into all the side MSQ characters who have North American VA's - something new with this expac - and their volume levels are so much higher than the rest of the cast. Its very much a mixing issue. One other little issue with the side NA cast is that they dont put any emotion into their lines when they obviously should be. So many lines are delivered flatter than a pancake,  it makes you wonder if SIDE bothered to give them a voice director, or do multiple takes.Oddly enough for being the expansion with the LONGEST msq it feels the most rushed. In a way its running into the same issue Stormblood has - two stories that should have been given their own expansions with time to breathe. I think this is the cause of my next criticism that has been floating around in my head - Dawntrail just feels so empty or unfinished.In all the other expansions it wasnt uncommon for there to be Yellow side quests that would have followups side plots to spawn new yellow quests to carry on the mini plot. I've done all the side quests in DT and only the blues had their quest chains. The crafter and gatherer side quests in the capital city dont have a capstone quest like we got for the Crystalline Mean or Studium deliveries. If you do decide to speak to the original quest giver he just says something like ""Hi thanks for doing my job. I knew you could do it."" Then there is the second city Solution Nine.... its more or less empty. Yeah there are some npc's but unlike Radz at Han there is no reason to keep going back except for the raid quests, and that is in only one TINY little corner of the city.",1723609464,13,0,negative

76561198080397019,336824,1624,english,"This review will be as spoiler free as possibleI would like to start my review by saying I love FFXIV with over 5200+ hours and having completed the Dawntrail Expansion I believe this game overall is an incredible experience with a great community, this review is negative specifically for the Dawntrail expansions Main Scenario Quest. I want to preface that this review is for the story elements of Dawntrail alone and that general gameplay through dungeons and trails, new items, graphics, and the music BY GOD THE MUSIC is masterfully done. However the story falls flat and really misses the mark. I found my self saying ""Wow A Realm Reborn had a better story :/""The best recap of what it feels like to play through Dawntrail is that you the warrior of light are a side character to Wuk Lamat. The real main character of the Dawntrail story. Did you want to see your character in cut scenes? Well Wuk Lamat is actually the one reacting to everything speaking and making the calls. Many shots of the warrior of light is just standing silently behind Wuk Lamat not doing anything or reacting while she yaps. Wuk Lamat has a story that could work but fails on execution as her development comes first in priority to everything else in the story including the player. Not to say that the Warrior of light needs to always have the spot light but by playing through Dawntrail my WoL was a glorified NPC as the spotlight was constantly on Wuk Lamat trying to do simple tasks and pouting being upset and trying to be a heroic leader.  Taking the spotlight away completely from the person who is paying the game was a bad choice. Its ok when a NPC has a chance to develop or we follow their story arc aside from our own for a few quests in fact I think thats important to develop the character but despite every single quest in dawntrail being focused on Wuk Lamat I dont see how she has developed as a character. She only really seems to have gained confidence which makes her character more painful as the more confidence she gains the more talking she does taking more and more time just watching her from the back line.I found myself actually doing the random yellow side quests in Dawntrail because those small side quests actually had a better story line than the MSQ. I felt I was actually helping or doing something important when doing those quests even if small. The MSQ just seemed kinda goofy just doing everything Wuk Lamat asked for like my WoL was a puppet to the main character furry DMPC. Wuk Lamat cant tie her shoes? ""WoL I have a job for you!""At the end of Endwalker I was actually worried for Dawntrail because I didnt know what or how they were going to improve dungeons or make new trail bosses, but they blew my expectations out of the water. My only complaint is the MSQ but seeing as you have to do the MSQ to do the dungeons and post game content you have to witness Wuk Lamat. Unless you buy a story skip. I hate that I sit down and think that wow I wish I would have skipped this story completely. Ive always advocated for new players to take their time playing and to enjoy the story or any aspects that they like and leveling the classes. I disliked that this almost feels like a way to try to get people to buy a story skip because of how bad it is. I have to mention that the 2nd half of the story does get better as you get to the end but sadly the first half just ruined my mood by showing Wuk Lamat try to be all sunshine and rainbows yet being unable to really do anything important. The 2nd half has some likeable characters and I enjoyed the last 10% ish of the story but still my judgment on Wuk Lamat ruining the first half stands.The FFXIV team is one of my favorite development teams because they actually play their game and listen to the community. I am however pretty hopeful and pretty confident in the FFXIV team to learn from how poorly this expansion was received and make more fulfilling future content. This feels like a slip up for the series and its certainly hard to follow Shadow bringers and End walker but im hopeful that things get better from here. Should you play the game? Yes even only if to experience the rest of the game outside the story, but as I have enjoyed the story of the game up to here this was a huge letdown and I really hope the next expansion is written with more direction and more focus of the journey of the player of the game.",1723574871,15,0,negative

We were promised a ""beach episode"" and I was ready for whimsical times with the scions and the newly introduced Wuk Lamat. Instead we got some of the most abysmal world building I have experienced in recent memory mixed with tedious quests, a ridiculous plot, and insultingly phoned in characters.The absolute lack of good character writing is the greatest crime of this expansion. Everyone is the equivalent of a cardboard cutout. Even Wuk Lamat, who eats up 95% of the expansion with her incessant preaching of ""peace and happiness"" (with no actual plan to preserve said peace), has the most lackluster and boring character arc. Apparently learning about the people you are trying to rule over is the only qualification for leadership when really that should be considered the bare minimum.I came out this MSQ with over a hundred questions concerning the world building and plot decisions. Normally I can suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment, but Dawntrail has no respect for your time nor your intelligence.[spoiler] Galool Ja Ja, a blessed sibling of the Mamool Ja, who has ruled over Tural for 80 years, did absolutely nothing to stop the eugenic breeding of blessed siblings and did nothing to solve their food crisis, which we solved in a day by importing plants (because NO ONE thought of this!!!???)

The game has become too simplistic to be enjoyable or interesting, except to the most dedicated fans. Job rotations and fights have been homogenized and made easier than ever.The developers seem to lack ideas for advancing the game, leaving it on life support to generate revenue for other projects. As a veteran player, I find the current state of the game profoundly disappointing, even to the point of disgust. Square Enix appears to neglect this game, diverting its revenue to other endeavors. The lack of investment and care is evident.Fundamental problems persist, such as buff/debuff limits, server tick issues, and slow, unevolved combat. These issues result in restricted fight design, rigid damage profiles, and simplified DPS and healing optimizations compared to past content. The developers seem to be intentionally removing complexity for the sake of accessibility and profitability.This expansion has also killed any interest I and many other players had in the story.

You want to enjoy that raised level cap, more gear options, more jobs, more hunts to go on, more mounts to find, and just more things to see in general. If you are wondering if you want to get into this MMO, this expansion will not be the one that likely sells it to you.This expansion has a lot to prove given the long story arc leading up to it, and so that likely makes some of the negativity it is receiving at least somewhat unfair. I waited to finish the expansion, and I took my time doing it as well. The introduction of mediocre characters does not have to make the story bad, but constantly forcing them into center stage is going to make what short comings they might have all the harder to ignore. Some of the new cast members are there enough to help you get an idea of who they are and what they are about, and then they do not overstay their welcome. Which is a good thing. But I no longer have an overarching story to help give focus to the direction that I am going, instead I am getting info dumped in the first half. The music is passing in some cases or good in others, but if it stood out to me it was for the wrong reasons. It is not all bad, there is lots to enjoy like the scenery or the developers continuing to build on battle mechanics to make them more engaging, but it gets pulled aside and held up too often by jarring interactions or a reminder that you as the player have been pushed out of the position you held for so much else of the story before this so that you can be something else, something less in my opinion.These are my feelings after I tried to sit down and make sense of the many times that I felt bothered or simply taken out of the experience while I tried to go through the main story to unlock the content.

We as player killed many gods, defeated the literal void incarnated, saved an empire while destroying another, and much more. yet we can't deal with a stupid little lizard with no background or power!? WHY WERE WE ALONE DOING THE OTHER EPIC THINGS. WHY DID THEY (Dawntrail characters) NEVER CHIME IN DURING THE GALAXY-WIDE TROUBLES!?Why do we have to gather bird poop? To avoid fighting but then fight anyway because the narrative is useless since the enemies placement prevent the narrative from working at all.Time travel never worked. Here's a huge spoiler : I'm warning you the next little paragraph is a huge spoiler: The end boss is a secretary turned robot because he was mad his candidate didn't win the election so he sent power rangers to destroy the city FROM THE FUTURE. and THEN he went to the future for the first time and then went back to the past in the future from the future past (BS). And in order to fight him we have to waste our time ruining a cyber-city memory server and chasing a hologram around. Hologram was an android hiding from us because in the past from the future alternate dimension someone told her something and did whatever. then we gather more poop and watch other npc do stuff while we wait for the last chapter.I am not kidding.QoL-wise this expansion is a huge success. New raids, new glams, new functions, more gameplay, more features, etc. Everything from the utility side is amazing. MSQ Duty are better than ever. Story-wise nothing makes sense and we are not even needed. The only thing we as player have any agency or worth is defeating the last boss who is SOMEHOW stronger than all the gods and voids combined.... and is a robot from the future-past-future. Everything up until then can be left to the NPC. You literaly can not progress in the story without telling the NPC to do their thing or ask them how to progress and then watch them do it in your stead. Crop issues? Do lots of work toward fixing the issues and then watch an NPC fix it for you instead. Bandits? watch NPC deal with them... and go gather bird poop instead. Weird invasion? Follow the NPC around until the issue is fixed. Out of the 6 or so required solo duty for story, you only have to act in 2 of them, and one of those two is you playing as an NPC. YOU DO NOT MATTER. You are more of a sideline character than ever before.It's great that the story doesn't need a hero. but why do we have to stand there and watch at all? It's infuriating. Wish I could go back and skip everything.it had so much promises at the start. We were promised a city of gold, new adventures, new exploration, new world.... We got auto-travel, deceptions, same-old, sent to the sideline... And the lore is basically 6 line of text for the whole continent. COuntry bad, new king did this and that, new country good, now need heir, select heir though trials repeating good king story.While the new mechanics and functions are great, I can not in all honnesty recommend this expansion.

Secondly, the storywriting, which was the main draw of FF14, is not good. I'll address the main problem first: Wuk Lamat. At the onset of the story, it doesn't seem like she'll be a bad character. However, the annoyances really start adding up when she starts receiving undue credit for other people's accomplishments or ideas, undeserved praise for things she has not earned, or the upteenth time when an NPC recognizes she's a princess. She is the main character of the this expansion, not you. The idea could have been novel - playing the mentor to a young grasshopper trying to become a hero in his or her own right. That is not what we are given here.  It is very much in the style of Lyse from Stormblood - in all the ways I didn't enjoy then, either.That is the first half of the story.  Don't get me wrong - there are some nice and interesting moments, this story is not good. Furthermore, we were promised larger roles for some other beloved characters that are again pushed aside for Wuk Lamat.The second half of the story does not make significant improvements to this. It is very much copying the homework of other expansion packs and does not deliver nearly as skillfully.This review is not blind hatred for a particular character. I went into this expansion with measured expectations, expecting something on the level of the better parts of Stormblood or A Realm Reborn. On the whole, it is better than A Realm Reborn simply by virtue of the improvements made over years to the game itself. It is worse than Stormblood at present. Stormblood had Doma and the excellent post-vanilla patch content that truly redeemed it. If Dawntrail does not receive a similar treatment, it will be the worst of the expansions in FF14 as far as its story.Please return to us, Ishikawa-san.

Unlikable and uninspired characters, especially the main one (Wuk) that you are supposed to care about.Some of the fights are pretty nice but not enough to make up the slog and lazy writing of the msq.I'll quote (or at least paraphrase) another review I read ""The xpac was clearly designed from the ground up to shove a message down our throats but it's so convoluted no one can figure out what it is.""It's obvious the team that did the writing had never played the game before and had only the most basic information given to them (or ignored all but the most basic information).

And worst of all, her villains just fold and give in. The English VA for Wuk Lamat is terrible. They went with an absolute nobody who has 0 prior experience. She can't convey any emotion besides bubbly and happy. They had one really amazing opportunity at the end of the MSQ to give Wuk Lamat a huge, super important and difficult decision that would have been character defining and redeemed a lot of the boring BS that MSQ made you sit through.But they just didn't use it. They had her enemies just be... happy to lose so that she wouldn't have to feel bad about anything. Outside of the MSQ story sucking, FFXIV is still a great game. The fights are fun as hell and have the most amazing music. So overall I give FFXIV a thumbs up, no hesitation.

76561197970564657,0,0,english,"In very brief, if you've already bought into XIV and decided you want to play it, you're going to end up buying Dawntrail, because it's the next step on the content ladder. It doesn't really matter if you like it or not, you're going to end up buying it, because otherwise you're going to be in dead content zones that nobody really frequents. That said, below are my thoughts on the game's storyline and general gameplay additionsSTORYLINE - 1/5I simply cannot fathom how this game's story made it past a quality assurance team. It's like not a singular person on the development team decided to play their own game to find out if it was actually interesting or fun.The overwhelming majority of storyline quests involves following or talking to NPCs, watching cutscenes, and hearing the primary character, Wuk Lamat, talk like a shounen protagonist in a manga written for kindergardeners. Unless you find it enjoyable sitting and watching a movie while you occasionally get a prompt to walk somewhere and talk to someone, it's simply not fun.There are dozens and dozens of plotholes that come in a variety of forms. Sometimes you will have scenes that have ominous dialogue that seems to be alluding to events yet to come, that ultimately goes nowhere as if the writers had simply forgotten about it. Often you get plot revelations that don't really make sense given prior context, as if one of the writers quit midway through production and all his replacement had to work with was half-legible bar napkins that contained important story beats, and he blew his nose with around a third of them before realizing how important they were. I am only around 15 hours into the storyline, and this stuff is so prevalent that I have simply stopped caring about the storyline. It doesn't respect your intelligence and it's not interesting enough to turn your brain off to.I have literally gotten to the point where I don't even want to play through the main storyline quests anymore because they are so boring, so stupid, and so poorly written. I've spent the last two weeks just playing PvP and the Gold Saucer. If you take absolutely nothing else from my review, it should be this; I literally view the MSQ of Dawntrail as a chore, not content that is enjoyable or interesting. On its face, that is absolutely damning.None of this is helped by the fact that the primary character the story revolves around, Wuk Lamat, is very obnoxious, childishly written, and is utterly omnipresent. You literally cannot escape this character for more than 5 minutes at a time save for an hour or so in a segment partway through the game. Even after a pivotal point in the storyline where it would logically conclude her presence in the storyline, she finds a way to worm her way back into the story and the writers seem bound and determined to make everything revolve around her, to a degree that borders on satirical. It doesn't help that Wuk Lamat's English voice actor is utterly terrible; a lack of range and emotion makes the character monotonous and strange to listen to, which is again compounded by the fact that the character is inescapable. I don't know where they found Wuk Lamat's English voice actor, but do yourself a favor and switch to Japanese voices. It doesn't help with the bad writing, but at least Wuk Lamat's Japanese voice actress was capable of some emotion in her voice.In brief, the storyline of Dawntrail (the actual writing, the character it revolves around, and the actual gameplay of the storyline quests) are shockingly bad. It is an extreme and obvious step in quality below any prior expansion, and after Shadowbringers it frankly gave me whiplash with how bad it was. I was so bored and so begrudged playing through it that I eventually have just started avoiding doing it because it's simply not fun.GAMEPLAY - 3/5The new gameplay elements introduced by Dawntrail is primarily just a new set of dungeons, raids, and a pair of classes, the Viper and the Pictomancer. As I have not gotten to the new raids yet, I won't be commenting on those.The Viper and Pictomancer are decent enough additions to the game and are enjoyable enough to play. I have found myself enjoying Viper the most of the melee dps classes, though I don't quite like Pictomancer a lot due to aesthetic reasons, but it definitely has its fans. I can't rightly say they are especially fun or interesting, but they are decent new content and have their own class quests with a mini storyline to go through, which were incidentally more interesting than the main storyline of Dawntrail to me.The developers have indicated in prior interviews that Dawntrail's battle content was supposed to be harder than older expansions, but the general dungeon design remains the same as ever. You fight two groups of monsters, you fight a mini boss, and then you repeat this two more times at which point you fight the dungeon boss instead of a mini boss. The mechanics are fun enough but don't come off as particularly unique or hard, at least not enough to warrant praise. In general, it's more of the same. Maybe this is different in the raid content of the game; again, I haven't gotten to that point yet.MUSIC - 3/5The music of the game is a mixed batch. Some of it feels strangely inappropriate; the South American styled city of Tuliyolla has jazz music in it. It definitely has nothing on The Crystarium, Sharlayan, or Ishgard's themes. Other themes are better; the zone music is generally pleasant to listen to, but again, nothing particularly stands out to me. I haven't heard all the themes, but as of about halfway into the main storyline, it's so far nothing to write home about. GRAPHICS - 4/5The graphics update looks fairly nice in general but it's worth noting that it actually introduced some new and interesting problems to older content. For example, a couple bosses in the Nier raids look noticeably worse, which was very strange to see. That said, player characters are almost uniformly an upgrade, and the zones of Dawntrail are generally quite beautiful and very interesting to look at. Overall a few downsides in regards to how it affected older content, but the newer content looks great and characters look betterMISC FEATURES - 1/5The advertised 2 dye channel update to the game's dye system is very disappointing frankly. Most armor and weapons simply don't have a 2nd dye channel as they haven't been updated, and of those that do have a 2nd dye channel, a worryingly large number of them only let you dye a tiny and almost invisible part of the article of clothing. For instance, there's a Tonberry outfit in the game; the primary dye channel lets you dye the robe, and the secondary dye channel only affects a tiny string the robe you won't even notice unless you zoom all the way in and carefully look for it. Why even pretend there's a meaningful thing to dye? Very disappointingOVERALL - 2/5If Dawntrail was its own stand alone game, absolutely nobody would buy it. The story is awful, the characters are terrible, and the gameplay and music is ok but simply nothing special, and many of the features the developers advertised largely aren't even implemented. The graphics are improved and there's new content to do, but that's about all the positives. That said, it's an MMO expansion, so if you are interested in keeping up in the gear and content treadmill, you'll be buying Dawntrail. That is not a recommendation, it's just a statement of fact. Dawntrail is probably going to be the reason I let my sub lapse. I simply cannot justify paying money for an expansion on top of a monthly fee for such a bad game. The quality is nowhere near that of the prior expansions. Getting through the main story line quests is an actual chore because of all the above mentioned issues. A game you pay money for to entertain yourself shouldn't feel like a chore. XIV's devs should be ashamed of letting this thing hit the market in this state.",1722775971,232,5,negative

Didn't skip a single cutscene but if i could go back few weeks i'd probably do it now that i know how the story ends. MSQ missions were such a chore to do.

There's few parts in which her voice just doesn't reflect how serious the situation is and I'm cringing so hard i'm causing permanent damage to my teeth. One thing I can say with confidence is that the dungeons, trials and raids (so far) have been some of the more enjoyable content. ""Indeed, thou seekest mine opinion on the latest chronicles unveiled under the banner of Dawntrail, and I shall endeavor to convey such sentiments in a manner befitting mine own peculiar dialect. Verily, the whispers of adventurers and scholars alike hath carried tidings of this fresh foray into uncharted territories, and yet, within mine heart, a sense of disquiet doth linger. Forsooth, the tales woven therein, though resplendent in their promise, seemeth to lack the luster of yore.In days of eld, when first I laid mine eyes upon the vast expanse of Eorzea, mine soul didst swell with anticipation and wonder. Each revelation and discovery felt as a veritable tapestry of rich lore and intrigue, drawing one deeper into the embrace of the narrative. The very essence of the realm seemed to pulse with vitality and purpose, each step taken a testament to the grandeur of the unfolding epic.Yet now, as we tread upon the soil of this newfound land, a shadow of doubt doth cloud mine thoughts. The once fervent flame of excitement burneth with less intensity, as though the embers of inspiration hath waned. The melodies that once stirred the heart to valiant deeds now seem but echoes of their former glory, reverberating through halls that stand less awe-inspiring than those of previous epochs.Indeed, it is with a heavy heart that I must concede, though it pains me to utter such a proclamation.

No, speak with Wuk Lamat.You wanted to learn more about Krile's grandfather who got sent the letter that kicked off this WHOLE STORY? No, speak with Wuk Lamat. We'll cram all that in for about 2 quests at the very end of the story so we can say we got to that but not do Krile's story any justice whatsoever or give it the time and energy it deserved. Which is INFURIATING because for the few moments we get of Krile's story, there are really interesting lore bits which tie back to the scholar's story from ARR, the most recent varient dungeon that came out, and Lalafell history in general which was REALLY interesting and I can't help but wonder what the world would look like if the whole story was like that.Instead there's an entire 4 hour long quest zone where you learn the cultural significance of a rainbow colored banana. I wish I was joking and I will never let them live that down. But hey, I'd forgive all the forced dialogue with Wuk Lamat if she had anything interesting to say, but more often than not she just has the CW dialogue where she borderline stares at the camera and tells the audience how they should be feeling the entire time. Hell everybody does, it's like they got somebody to write the msq who's only ever written like 3 sidequest chains before... oh wait...The whole thing feels like a bad 30 hour long beast tribe daily where all of the characters you've come to love run off on their own and pawn you off with the new main character of the entire story because she's so annoying none of them want to be around her for more than 5 minutes, I kid you not every single quest area Wuk Lamat insists on going with you or dragging you around and EVERYONE is like ""y'know what i'm good I think I'll stay out here/go with someone else you got it tho"" without fail, you never get to hang out with anyone but Wuk Lamat. Which stems from this expansion trying to have your character step back from ""super cool main character that everybody loves"" for a while to tell a more low stakes story after going to space and fighting gods last expansion, which hey I get it, and I was REALLY on board at first, but after you get Wuk Lamat her throne, about halfway through the story, and things start to get serious again, they don't let go of her being the new main character and she continues to insist on butting in and being the main character still completely overstaying her welcome for the back half of the story and becoming annoying FAST, and they really thought all of the FFIX nostalgia and fanservice would be enough to distract people and make them forgiving of the absolute slog this entire thing was, I'd say it's worse that Stormblood at points. I won't even touch on how boring Erenville is here or i'd be writing a novel.TL:DR all of the content is fantastic, the jobs are fun, but the meat of the expansion, the story, is mind numbingly dull and downright annoying. you won't miss anything at all if you look up what the 2-4 quests that actually have to do with Krile are and skip everything else.",1722668783,13,0,negative

Despite the open letters that revealed several features that looked pretty promising at first, I was still interested about the ones that would be available past 7.0. That being said, I waited it out for a few weeks past the launch date as I minding my own business with other games until I decided to give the expansion a try and then...[h1]WTF IS THIS?![/h1]For the first time worth of story and content that has lasted for 10 years from A New Realm Reborn, Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers, Endwalker and then Dawntrail, I was absolutely disappointed with it and [i]I decided to skip ALL of the damn cutscenes to just enjoy the combat side of it instead.[/i] Seriously, I have never seen the writing of this story become this utterly bad and rather a slog with it's pacing which it made me think it was either rushed or could have stayed in the oven longer. Hell, even if I gave some cutscenes a chance, I would literally fall asleep as they are boring as hell which it gave me a red flag by [b]DURING THE FIRST HALF OF IT BEFORE THE FIRST DUNGEON![/b]Anyway, as much I could have let it give another chance, I just did not care anymore and decided to forget it's story existed as if it remained to be poorly made from start to finish. What pisses me off more is that some of the characters that I knew of from previous expansions were never fleshed out which that brings me another thing...[h1]The Elephant in the Room, Wuk Lamat[/h1]I will be real with you, I did not like her by the time when she becomes the main character of the story and constantly be everywhere by being annoying, lack any real sort of character growth or development and becoming a babysitter. What's even worse is that when she couldn't even give me [b]THE LAST TRIAL[/b] was what made me absolutely despise her. The voice acting is another thing but, I just cannot stand her as a whole and that really says for something as many other people have pointed it out about it. God, it makes me miss Lyse since Stormblood. She may be an honest to god moron but, I at least tolerate her to some degree.[h1]Okay, what about the combat?[/h1]Frankly, the combat is an improvement! The dungeons, trials and raids were amazing with more stuff involved and it's significant increase with it's difficulty than the previous expansions. It is a real welcoming change and I do hope they keep it that way here and out since I felt pretty much bored with doing previous combat duties from previous expansions for a long while.This is pretty much my saving grace from this expansion and I have nothing else to say about other things than being just as good as I expect to be (especially the music).[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]Overall, Dawntrail is...not an good expansion due to it's story being poorly told, awful pacing and lack of execution. Some people are considering it as the worst expansion more than A New Realm Reborn (Base game) and Stormblood, I personally find very close to it which that's really unfortunate. The combat was still amazing, don't get me wrong, but I just cannot accept what Dawntrail delivered. I hope the post patches may save the last of it but, what at cost? The expense of getting rid of Luk Wamat and flesh out whatever the team had going for this story for better or worse. Maybe the new combat instance (like Bozja from Shadowbringers) in later patches would be my main enjoyment but, that remains to be seen.This was not the vacation that I have hoped for and it felt like a scam in the end. Then again, maybe letting the game go would be the best for me since I had more fun playing other games such as Baldur's Gate than...this.",1722648289,15,0,negative

I did not even do this with Stormblood. And this is especially bad, because this expansion marks the start of the next 10 years. If this is the start, I feel worried.To give a little insight before I tackle the story:The areas are very big and varied. No 3x desert like Stormblood was. They are huge in size, a little to its downside. The battle content has not been this engaging since the big job rework in Shadowbringers.But now the story. First off, my expectations were on the level of Heavensward to ARR. Nothing big or fancy. I was hoping DT would bring up narrative themes, characters or alliances that would outlive the expansion itself. A setup like ARR did, since EW resolved all our threats, Zodiark and Hydaelyn as well as the WoL agency. By the end of 7.0 nothing was built up that seems it will outlive the expansion ([spoiler] only we get a magic item that allows possible reflection travel [/spoiler]. ARR did that at the end of it and all other expansions had a post credit cutscene touching on the existing threats (Ascians, Garlemald, etc.). We as a character do not get a new calling, we remain an adventurer. (ARR saw in us at least a useful tool for slaying primals).Now the story of DT itself. It consists of 2 halfs that besides playing on the same continent do clash harshly in tone and theme. Since again we have to stories told in one expansion, both are rushed and underdeveloped. We bring up even previous resolved themes again with the final zone ([spoiler]The endless are basically the Ancients reloaded.[/spoiler]) Interesting themes are brought up here and there, but never really followed through. Any theme of grief is quickly brushed aside with something that I could only call as toxic positivity.The pacing of the story is all over the place. The start is so slow, that I was thinking of skipping it, then things are happening all at once, then we have a whole area of filler quest and then things need to go fast again.The characters feel hollow this expansion, because only Wuk takes center. Even when the Scions are the experts for the situation at present, she is there to take the spotlight. All the others are only there to shine light on her as a character. But by the end...I knew nothing more of her that was not apparent than in 6.55. This is just sad. And it all leads into a credits theme that Disney would use.Furthermore the voice acting and mixing is bad. It feels often wooden oder badly mixed at best.To summerize:DT lacks care. Care for a cohesive narrative with its own deep theme that is not ""Friendship is magic"". Care for its characters that are not Wuk Lamat. Care for the voice acting. And care for the next ten years. But at least the battle content has been taken care of. I cannot in good conscience recommend this expansion. Only if you skip everything and focus only on the battle. My wish for the future: Create an overarching narrative framework ASAP that outlasts DT, give all characters time in the MSQ and give the WoL a calling again (We are no longer a primal slayer and Hydaelyns chosen).",1722548149,25,0,negative

I loved how they introduced her prior to the expansion and thought she was going to be a great companion, but my opinion of her soured VERY quickly. She constantly feels unworthy and looks to us to boost her ego... even though we also are doing all the bloody work.This was constantly advertised as our 'vacation' expansion. But it very quickly turns into ""You're an unknown outside contractor helping Wuk Lamat.""We SAVE all of creation! Killed gods, prevented calamities, ended wars that lasted a thousand years.... and almost nobody in this DLC treats you as anything more than ""Oh.. you're Wuk Lamat's helper."" Which can be refreshing at first... but everyone underestimates you to extreme levels that proving them wrong is... dull.Even the crafting and gathering quests... after you've made a name for yourself across worlds, people treat you like you're a nobody here and at some point, it crosses a line of disrespect.I'm NOT saying don't play this expansion because the game play elements and dungeon mechanics are really fun...

And then have had everything around it - clumsily - updated, to justify (sooo so hard trying to) their presence in it. Which - of course - ended up in overdoing it and killing otherwise, potentially decent story and good narrative.Just 2 'quick' examples to illustrate what I mean:---> Had the main character been gone and 1st part of story revolved around other 3 contenders only... plot would actually MADE more sense:*  dorky guy would learn about value of tradition and people and become 'tech leader', *  brutish guy would learn about value of honour, compassion and people and become 'war leader', *  true blood guy would become the villain.

HE'S BAD.---> Handling of family feels like it was written by deranged psycho:* Main character meets her father and... is not interested about anything about him. Just moves on. * Another character meets his mother, that treats him like a pet and he treats her like annoying teenage girlfriend.* New father abandons his child, then tries to strangle him, then on death bed spouts some emo grade deranged reasoning that he did that because his father spurned him.No mention or introduction of mothers in 1st or last case. No mention or introduction of father in 2nd. No interest in any case of children about that 'other' parent at all.

76561198015485503,82449,924,english,"[h1]The adventure is a lie.[/h1]I never thought I would give an negative review, but here we are.[b]TLDR:[/b] For an MMO that is story focussed. They completely missed the mark with Dawntrail. The new characters they introduced are sloppy and the story is even worse. Up to level 97 the story doesn’t really get interesting and can be described as “not even being worthy of a side quest”. If you could skip this DLC and watch a 15-minute story video, you would be able to cover everything this DLC has to offer in terms of the story. Furthermore, you are not the main character of this DLC. While this is not necessarily a bad thing. After slaying gods and going to the end of existence, you are treated as nothing more than a babysitter in this DLC. How they executed this was simply not good. The music is good, sometimes not fitting. New Areas are ok and some zones are breathtaking.They should’ve shortened the level 90 – 96 quests to simply level 90 – 93 quests and then continue on into the unknown and do your world building. That would’ve really helped this DLC.The promise of the golden city was so much, and instead we ended up, wherever the hell we ended up.The worst (or better) part is, the side stories (e.g. side quests, but also the level 100 raid storyline) is much better than the MSQ, even the characters are better. And that's not really good for your MSQ if that is the case.As the developers already said, this DLC is going to be an experiment, I really hope that they take all the feedback to heart and produce a new awesome DLC next. Or otherwise, I’m afraid this DLC will be the start of the end of FFIXV.I really miss shadowbringers.Now for the long version.First, let’s focus on what went well.[b]New areas/world (B): [/b]The new areas are great. They are beautiful and each area is interesting. You can really be awed by some of the areas, and they come when you least expect it. But there are also areas that are underwhelming. Especially compared to the areas with the previous expansions. Furthermore, there are areas which are not used to its full potential, and you spend maybe 4 hours in them before completing everything.Also, the way they mixed some cultures/continents together was really weird. One thing you’re in south America, and suddenly you’re in Texas, and then you are in the future.[b]Music (A):[/b]Just like all final fantasy XIV music, the music is great. But I wouldn’t say it was the best music of all the expansions. There were a few areas where I thought: “This music isn’t really fitting here”.[b]Graphic update (A+):[/b]I never imagined that the graphics update was so needed. From the landscapes to the buildings, to the hair, everything has more detail. But especially the upgrade of the amours. The armours are extremely beautiful now with lots of details.Now let’s look at the bad things:[b]MSQ (E-):[/b]As mentioned above, for an MMO which is story heavy, the MSQ has to be good. You are promised a new adventure, and for 80% of the MSQ you are merely babysitting Wuk Lamat. The side characters are not memorable as I forgotten some of them already when they came back a few hours later. What is worse, is how they have written Wuk Lamat. As you are not the main character of this DLC (which is not inherently a bad thing), you should have strong companions who could fill that gap. The companion who fills that gap (Wuk Lamat) is nothing more than a baby who is leeching of you and has no character progression of her own throughout the whole DLC. She starts as an irritating baby, and she ends as an irritating baby who eats up screen time. Some of the major side characters have much better character progression and you really see them grow. And to not even talk about how rushed some of the stories where for the main companions, such as Krile and Erenville. Also, nothing really remarkable happens until at the very end. Where every previous expension has had it’s memorable moments (like ultimate thule, Amaurot, labyrinthos, Heavensward, etc.). I can go on about the details, but lastly is the lack of screen time of your most important companions, the scion’s. All the scion’s you love and ‘grew’ up with have barely any screen time. Instead you are being forced to watch a irritating baby.[b]Pacing (F-):[/b]You thought the filler in the middle of Endwalker was bad? Nearly half of the MSQ DLC is a filler. To the point where it became really, really, boring. It also went something like this:[i]Speak to X- Cut scene –[/i]Walk 50 meters.[i]Speak to Y- Cut scene –[/i]Turn your character around[i]Speak to X again- Cut scene –[/i]When a journal is saying 'Speak to X again' multiple times. You're doing something wrong.And this continued on for a majority of the quests. A lot of unnecessary time is waster just having a loading screen of 3 seconds at the end and beginning of every cut scene. Furthermore, every time you are hoping of “Yea, we are going on that train!” or “we are finally going to do that!”, only to get disappointed by more fetch and talk quests.

Wuk Lamat is not really a likeable or interesting character. She reminds me of Lyse from Stormblood. Overall the MSQ feels like a Sidequest with voiced cutscenes.I do hope they return to a story written for your character or at least an interesting one like Zero from the Post-Endwalker patches. (And please let Natsuko Ishikawa write the story again)// I wanna point out that i don't dislike the voice for Wuk Lamat at all. I think the voice fits her. I have heard that there is a vast difference in quality between the Japanese and English, but i cannot confirm this, since i don't speak Japanese. [h3]Zones[/h3]The first 2 1/2 Zones are very similar with some questionable design decisions that make traversal without flying rather bothersome. Later on the Zones get more interesting but are rather empty. Especially in the 2nd Main HUB you will most likely only find players in one corner while the rest of it is just empty - could have placed more NPCs to make it more lively. [h3]Music[/h3]Same with the Music. At the start very average and partly even obnoxious. It gets better later but nothing that comes close to previous Expansions.

Average. // I have since finally managed to do the current dungeons, trials and raids.The last MSQ dungeon was pretty nice i have to say and the final Trial as well up the point where they [spoiler] literally interrupted the fight for a cutscene where Wuk Lamat tries to... talk to the boss to make peace. Talk about anti-climactic. [/spoiler] Really ruined the fight for me.The raids are pretty decent. Boss designs are pretty nice, especially the 4th one.Location and Story are okay so far. Not as heavy as previous raids but okay. The new Jobs are nice, i guess. It's a matter of taste. Personally i don't enjoy Pictomancer too much - it gets very repetitive. Feels like a dumbed down version of BLM. Viper is fun, although has some questionable CD phases where you literally cant press a button for 1-2 seconds, which kinda ruins the flow. Apart from your super-saiyan mode the VFX for Viper look a bit hollow as well. This is my current opinion of Dawntrail. There are plenty of other reviews that are better at pointing out the flaws of this Expansions - so have a read. Luckily, there are a lot of other things, unrelated to the Expansion that remain interesting.FFXIV still has one of the best communities that i enjoy to engage with. And a lot of Content unrelated to the MSQ, that i like to do.",1722428256,19,1,negative

Oh you want to have your only moment of you being cool nope Wuk Lamat shows up at the end and gives you her awesome aura as a literal buff to steal the spotlight from you the main character. Look this is an MMO I come here to play a fantasy game and since the beginning of the game Iv'e been set up as the hero the one who can defy the odds and if the story isn't having my character actually being important in some way then that is a problem. In the Raid series its about your character so Suprise, Suprise its actually good you feel important. Her character is on screen so much she does not allow any of the much more interesting characters, have any character development, she drowns them in her awesome divine aura as the game puts it in the final fight. She is like a Primal that is tempering everyone around her wherever she goes in the story to loving her unconditionally.Now that the rant is over the only really good things i'll say are as long as you skip all Wuk Lamat dialogue you have a midcore story that you can probably say is on par with ARR or even below. 5/10 if we ignore Wuk Lamat with her i'd drop it to a 3/10 for story content being one of the worst MSQ they have done hands down the foundation is their with the areas characters but the execution was so poorly done. The new writers need to either be swapped out and let someone else have a go or have the old writers help them out a bunch or both needs to be done.Gameplay and the Dungeons/Trials/Raids are still fantastic. 10/10 this is good cause now we can hope the developers can make adjustments for the post content patches to have little to no Wuk Lamat and focus on other characters who got completely overshadowed.In the end this story was supposed to be a Vacation for the Warrior of Light what I got was needing a Vacation from Wuk Lamat. I Still say solid Expansion if your here just for Gameplay and could care less about story as their will be tons of new dungeons and raids and trials and exploratory zones to come over the next few patches.

[spoiler] putting the whole of Krile ""loredump"" ON A LEVEL 100 QUEST AT MAX LEVEL, is nothing short of a crime, whereas you spend half of the whole story following Lamecat and helping her do trivial chores everywhere.

76561198183239539,0,0,english,"To say I'm disappointed is, well, putting it lightly. For context, this was the first expansion of the game I would be able to play at day 1 since I started playing the game around the time of 6.2's(?) release. Overpower was still a cone shape when I started.I'll try to keep things relatively spoiler free and brief.Tl;Dr: Dawntrail is mid at best and confusing at worst. The antagonists are underdeveloped, and Wuk Lamat is a hit or miss on if you like her (especially given that the writers WILL try and make you hate her with how they handle her). The Scions have no reason to be in this expansion, but hey, we had to have somebody to put on the poster! However, the dungeon and overall environmental design are very good, and the new graphical update is great as well. New jobs are also really fun too!To be fair, here are some of the things I think were good about this expansion. I think the graphical update was long overdue and it is very nice seeing the updated textures/models/and lighting with all the new areas. I think the environment design is also some of its best, as most the areas don't feel big for the sake of big like with some of the areas in past expansions. Dungeon and trial design is also a net positive as most of the fights are engaging and occasionally tricky, and the new jobs are also fun to play around with! I for one love Pictomancer a lot... and it is here that my praises end.For the sake of brevity I am going to gloss over that the lighting in certain areas of the game has yet to be retooled/adjusted which makes some scenes from older areas/MSQ look a little off. That's just the nature of the beast, and I believe the devs plan to make those adjustments in future patches, so I'm not going to harp on it too much.Now for... everything else. I think overall this MSQ is the weakest out of every past expansion and ARR. It is mediocre at its best moments and terribly confusing/unbearable at its worst. The first half of the MSQ mostly suffers the crime of being too slow/boring. I enjoyed it to an extent, but once I realized the pattern was basically ""Talk to the locals. Learn their issues. Learn their culture. Solve the issues,"" about 6 times in a row... it became a bit of a slog. While there is some mild conflict between the succession groups in the early game, it's not enough to be truly engaging. There's a few points where it feels like the writers intentionally avoided having conflict between certain characters just to pick the easy route. I can see why most people would find it boring.The second half of the MSQ just... uhm, well, it's a mess. There's so many new concepts and characters that get thrown in over half-way through the story and it does not do anybody any favors. A lot of the new concepts introduced, in my opinion, feel disjointed from what we see in the first half of the expansion. It's like learning Spanish before suddenly being given a test in Japanese. It definitely doesn't meld as seamlessly as it should've. The main antagonists' goals, while conceptually interesting to a degree, do not get any true development making both of their arcs ultimately bland. The emotional arcs the writers try to set-up also fail spectacularly for both of these characters because they have nothing holding their characters up. They receive no greater development because most of the screen time has either been eaten up by people we ultimately never see again or is only used to show how mysterious said antagonist is. The allure of mystery is only going to take you so far.Speaking of characters, Wuk Lamat. I don't hate Wuk Lamat, but boy, it feels like the writers try really hard to make her as annoying as possible. I don't blame people for hating her. I think what mostly hurts her character is the writing decisions made surrounding her. A light spoiler, if you will: She is with you practically the entire MSQ. The game teases the player by acting like the second half will be you going on a solo adventure. You never get this. You never get your ""Hero"" moment. There is only Wuk Lamat now.Memes aside, this feels like the natural end result for this kind of character. The devs spent years conditioning the player base by giving them a good, player-oriented experience. It makes the player feel special, feel like a hero. The experience here feels deeply unsatisfying. You truly never get a moment where the focus is on you, the Warrior of Light. Except, I lied a little bit. There is one moment during the final trial... and it gets ripped right out of your hands at the very end. It sucks. While I don't mind the first half of the game focusing on Wuk Lamat, I definitely think the expansion would've positively benefited from her exclusion in the second half.On that note, the Scions. They should not have been included at all. the majority of them serve little significant purpose and could be completely cut out and replaced with other characters. Occam's razor, if you will. It feels like the devs thought players would POG at their faves being on screen for 5 seconds, but it made me more angry than anything. If you're going to have a beloved character there, then have them DO SOMETHING. It just felt hollow. I feel bad for Krile, considering the lead-up to Dawntrail marked her as a central character. She was done dirty. Her development felt artificial, especially regarding a certain plot point. It's wild to me that Eureka did more for her character than this entire expansion. I have nothing to say in regards to Erenville or the twins. Erenville was fine, I was never particularly interested in his character, but I think he had the most emotional arc out of everyone here. The twins were chill, though it felt like they were mostly there just to fill out the party sadly.I've ruminated on a lot of this for the past few weeks, but I do apologize if it reads as messy. I wanted to try and be fair, but I haven't felt this strongly about a game in a long while. I have not felt the drive to touch any of the Post-MSQ content for this expansion, so I cannot vouch for any opinions on that. I gave this expansion a fair shot. I went in with the mindset of wanting to like it, but came out kind of hating it story-wise. Ya hate to see it.",1722294087,16,0,negative

They could have chosen from a great number of professionals with actual chops and the skills that only a multilingual actor can utilize, but instead they chose... *that.* Not to mention that a transgender woman should be PERFECT for the voice of a tough lioness warrior, it seems like someone was afraid the voice would be too masculine and shied away from using the full extent of such an actor's voice.I'm so glad we're affording opportunities to people off the streets, Square Enix, but can we maybe not do that with a major character that the story practically revolves around?",1722288465,12,0,negative

76561198018676835,0,0,english,"I cannot in good faith recommend this expansion.The story of Dawntrail sidelines the warrior of light for a stereotypical shonen protagonist and we, as the player, have no real role within the story. The second half feels very much shoe-horned in and causes the pacing to be jarring while introducing two un-relatable antagonists who have hardly much motivation at all. It ends on a lot of open questions and lore logs feel inconsistent with pre-established lore.Dungeons are interesting but become repetitive quickly. Most bosses only perform a handful of mechanics and some only have 2 possible attacks. Their music and atmosphere is good however the combat and boss encounters felt lackluster. Due to current time of writing dungeons are also not great for experience as you're able to spam an Endwalker 24-man raid with the Azeyma's Earring and level far faster than any dungeon can until 97.Combat has largely been oversimplified but in a poor way. Most skills are now locked to only be used when you use a major buff skill and this tends to also clip into you cooldowns. Some skills are tied to others with almost no sense (Resonant arrow can only be used after barrage and can't be affected by barrage. Barrage doesn't even work on aoe skills. For example.)It feels largely dull and unrewarding to master you class or jarring to people who played a class for years only for it to be largely overhauled out of nowhere.The new classes aren't as fantastic as some of the others. Pictomancer does offer a fresh new take on casters though it can be goofy and cartoony if you're someone who desires a more serious tone. It does have an issue with aggro being generated rather quickly and the motif skills take 3 seconds and do nothing more than ""load a bullet"" for other skills.Viper, while flashy feels very largely unfinished. The class consists of maintaining a debuff and about 4 buttons while pushing another one in between. It offers nothing but damage and has absolutely no utility. At times it feels this class is also under-performing on DPS.Dawntrail as a whole feels vastly uninspired and unfinished while making nonsensical changes to classes. It feels they gave up on narrative and simply wanted to push content out rather than having quality content. It is sad to see that for the first time in over 10 years now of playing and loving this game that I can hardly bring myself to even log in or show interest in upcoming content.

76561198078537445,0,0,english,"I have so many words to describe how awful the writing felt. Usually I'm somewhat on the same page with my character, like, not exactly agree with what's shown on screen but can understand it or can allow it...I've never felt more at odds with my avatar in the game than in this expansion.Sure, previous ones also had their fair share of issues here and there but they were never this numerous and this blatant.I had set my expectations low...I was shocked to see that I should've set them much much lower.The writing, awful VA performances, especially Wuk's, and questionable use of music at times (the train building montage was weird and the use of Smile was even weirder), make this expansion feel more of a chore to finish as soon as possible to get to the good parts rather than the kind of journey it can only dream to be.Thankfully there are good parts...namely, gameplay and music (often used nicely and in and of itself still stellar), so my hope is that the writers for the MSQ are either removed from their positions or compile all the criticisms and learn from them and, if there was someone that dictated certain choices be made, I hope they are fired or never allowed to make choices again.The writing and, with it, the pacing are the main issues this expansion has. It really feels like two different groups of writers handled the two arcs of this expansion and it kinda shows in the way that certain characters seem to seemingly change for no reason.I've also seen many defend this or that decision but, most of the time, it's either ""one thing was said that could be interpreted to mean this"" or ""this could've happened because stuff could've happened off screen"" like, just stop. You are making excuses for horrible writing. It feels like amateurs wrote this and yes, if Square hired me, I feel confident I'd have been able to handle this storyline better than whoever's behind this.The players were not allowed a single-moment to rest...except Shaaloani but even that was badly written and short-lived as we were cast back into, in order, a world-ending scenario shortly followed by a multi-world ending scenario.We were promised adventure and a vacation...we got none of that. We got something akin to the Ascians but handled in such a naive and unsubtle way that made me start hating how every Scion's personality was nuked, how Erenville and Krile's personal arcs that could've been so so much better got butchered and how an interesting concept also got ruined because it was handled by people that clearly were unprepared to deal with these concepts and couldn't help themselves from shoehorning Wuk Lamat in almost any single interactions.Users have compiled the data of all the interactions in the expansion's MSQ, they made memes on it and discussions about it.So, to all the defenders of this expansion, I don't want to take away the love you may have for it BUT I hope you can all admit that this expansion is divisive in a way that ShB and EW never were despite them handling themes way more complex.To those screeching transphobia at whoever points out that Wuk's EN VA's performance is among the worsts of the bunch, shut up, you have a bias and your fervor doesn't do anyone good. It's perfectly fine to point out what was a major weak point that was only exacerbated from the fact that it was for such a predominant character in this expansion.Again, you do have a bias because you can't listen to how she speaks in the last trial and come here and say that it's perfectly fine...it's not. You may think so and that's good but it's just not.I still kinda like Wuk's character and I hope she gets handled much much better in future expansions but I came so close to wanting to choke her to death just to make her shut up by the time I got my alpaca.That's about it.

The main issue with this expansion is the bad writting, we came from saving the world and now we are the sidekick of a new character that will have no relevance in future expansions (like happened to lyse in stormblood), and even it could be done right.Considering this is a story focused game that's really a shame, I will not tell whats wrong with the story because many others did already.Another thing I dislike is how repetitive the quest are, basically ""Speak with Wuk Lamat"".The good things are the music, the raids and the diversity of cultures, but this is not enough to save the expansion",1722221716,12,0,negative

The story overall... worst of all the expansions AND ARR(really...). One causes of concern: Wuk Lamat (Mary Sue).So trying with no spoilers(for this expansion) and being as vague as I can, the start was fine'ish too cringe in many moments in my opinion (PoWeR oF FriEnDsHiP). Lack of character development for one of the main villains for e.g., seemed more like ""he's evil because he's evil"" a lot of ""foreshadowing"" like I'm twelve and can't get any deeper meaning from things. A lot of moments had incredible lack of agency from the ""player"" it was more or less the guy who killed elemental gods, gods, various other vastly powerful beings, stopped the end times, can't do sh*t for some reason (ohhhh and don't let me tell you about the end boss...).After everything the main character(well, not in this expansion, he's now a background character without any will of his own, didn't feel like my character is a hero even in many moments, moments where he could've saved some characters). Like I'm not sure for what this expansion was for, like there were very good points in the MSQ but if some things could've been taken out and changed it could've been a great expansion but right now..., I just want to go just lone wolf and traverse new places, than stay with the new crew of people which seemed lacking in character development, proper writting even.Best I can say skip the story, you won't miss much up until far far later levels of the expansion.",1722220180,6,0,negative

If you can ignore all the ridiculous things having to do with Wuk Lamat, Cahciua, etc then there's actually decent dungeons and trials to challenge and interesting locales to visit.

As someone who deeply enjoys Final Fantasy for the world-building and characters, that's why I had to set this to not be recommended.

76561198041695135,0,0,english,"Here’s the hard truth, spoiler free from someone with over 6k hours.THE GOOD-Fight encounters are unreal. Battle team showed up in spades-Pictomancer, feels fresh and is a blast.-Graphics update, say no more-Boss music and overall score, it’s good overall-Environments and atmosphere, some of the zones are rather gorgeous.THE BAD-Trope shonen manga story character arc. I’m sorry we deserve better storytelling than this coming from the previous four expansions. It’s just childish given the layers of stories and narratives XIV has excelled in telling us over the years. On top it's not even well told.-Zero screen time for any Scions. Instead rather, you’re force fed the most one dimensional character CBU3 has ever created who has one point she repeats ad nauseam onto you (and it’s literally just understanding others and the power of friendship). Oddly Wuk Lamat is sort of enjoyable at the beginning, the game just forces her and that message to you to so much you simply want nothing to do with her-and you haven't even gotten to the second trial yet. Expect to cringe a lot. She makes Lyse look like Kate Blanchett.-Pacing has just gotten progressively worse. Not the first time it's been a negative in other patches. But the excessive length of cutscenes, fetch quests, lack of interactions is just bizarre. So many moments in the story with missed opportunities.  Like when we're on ""that"" train and i was like YES we're going to man the guns millenium falcon style. No dice. One example, but things like that. Never have I noticed myself bored watching my WoL's journey till now.-Nothing really all that memorable or remarkable happens after it's all said and done. Remember how each previous expansion has some truly unique moments? The Ultima Thule climb, Thancred Metal Gear Solid, that time you found yourself in someone else’s body, Amaurot reveal, Tsukiyomi, All of Heavensward etc etc. This one I got to watch Estinien have fun while I didn’t, do a top chef cookoff (great idea could have been better), and a chance to finally see Krile’s backstory (Spoiler: nope, that one was rushed and cut short in favor of our irritating protagonist's screen time).-Side characters are completely forgettable. That one Pelu pelu you're supposed to know but they all look and sound the same. That one Hrothgar in the first zone who was quirky, but then every other one since (spoiler, there's like one in every zone dressed the same) all had the same dialogue and responses as well. I took my sweet time through MSQ and I still don’t recall a single name. -Later zones look like stereotype environments and just feel uninspired. Solution 9 looks like something Midjourney would output if you typed in futuristic synthwave cyberpunk. I normally love that aesthetic, but it's so generic and doesn't feel unique to what that ""world"" would have become over time. Shaloanni ""the wild west"" is the most worthless, uninspiring zone with poorly written and voice acted stereotyped “texas american” actors. Imagine a western with zero tension. Silver lining is you finally get away from Wuk Lamat for a short time.-Barely any Krile and Erenville time, the two most people you’d thought the expansion would have to chill and explore with. Especially Krile, she actually has a really interesting wrinkle in her backstory. Instead you only get to touch upon it lightly and at the end. Even in her expansion she takes the back back seat.-This part will be subjective, but we have to talk music. It is decent overall, it is just not Soken’s best. Usually there’s a strong, memorable theme with leif motifs used throughout and some extended themes. This one doesn't really have any main theme, just a few  smaller subsets with some leif motif light versions used throughout. The problem is all of them together they feel disconnected and all over the place. While that is not entirely a bad thing, the bigger problem is the tonality of the chosen music feeling completely off base in context of the story. The jazz and southern swing together in the city, the 'muzak' of Shaolanni.'  And the big elephant everyone points to... Smile, which has to be one of the worst songs i’ve ever heard from the FFXIV music team, let along FF as a whole. When it plays each time within the story, it’s confusing and jarring in relation to the moment.  Then you have this latin inspired fight music that is lighthearted and whimsical which works (initially) for an upbeat adventure story that this was advertised as. But juxtapose that later on in zones of the game that are grim sadness of it all...  it takes that emotion and makes it all feel like a complete joke when you do . Nevermind also that the vocals in just about every vocal track are rather poor. There are some gems, but just don't expect this one to feel S tier like the previous expansions. It's good in parts, but not the soundtrack I’d enjoy end to end like the others. Soken is mortal afteral.-Even more cultural misappropriation, and it's borderline immersion breaking. If Radz-at-Han was India, let’s now choose South America this time, but also fuse Mexican and southern US as well. I don’t know but this is becoming a bit less like true fantasy inspiration and now becoming part of their formula. Not sure how I feel about this. I'd like a bit less reality in my fantasy. For example, I don't mind the idea of tacos in this world, but devoting cutscenes to the unique culinary methods of Cochinita Pibil in how it's cooked underground using achiote  the same way the Mayans have done it for generations in the Yucatan does what for your game? Showing you can't come up with something unique to your own game world? The Ugly-Shoddy audio and poorly mixed voice acting. The levels and recording quality is just flat out inconsistent here, really noticeable in Shalaonni. There are some YouTube videos on this. But as someone who is involved in production and  mixing at record sessions, this seems very off for team Yoshi-P. Have a feeling this was outsourced with not much oversight.-You the WoL are a fly on the wall until the last fight (but not really). You take the backseat the entire story. Truthfully this shouldn't be a bad thing, I don’t mind letting things play out with others for a while. But there's gotta be some balance. Doing this for an expansion worth of long noninteractive content is boring. And you'll notice a great many things happen, another  whole world ending journey could have been solved multiple repeated times had the WoL simply jumped in when they should have at that moment. One and done. While it wouldn't have made a good story, it would have actually made more sense for them to do so. The trick is they needed to make it where I couldn't have, again... storytelling 101.-Main villain is kind of one note, and hard to get their motive other than just being a warmonger. They try to make a relatable backstory, but it lands like an air ball from a 3 point jump shot. Felt nothing for them, before and after it's over.-Excessive use of flashbacks. Never have I seen this in any expansion where they forced the point that happened minutes ago with a flashback to MAKE SURE YOU GOT THE POINT. Treats the audience like we’re children.-Tuliyollal kind of lacks the awe and wonder of every previous expansion city. Really not that interesting compared to Sharlayan, Crystarium and Kugane.-Another world ending affair after they said they would likely not rely on that every expansion…we’re now in Marvel Multiverse sort of territory now that the gates are open (pun intended) and there’s no going back.TLDR: A new chapter in a new journey doesn't mean you have to forgo storytelling basics to force a childish message, a character, a tone or a story formula for their 3 dungeons 1 trial formula. On paper by concept, the story framework was a decent one to tell. Just poorly executed and contrived.  Where as every other expansion is peak fiction.",1722207916,63,0,negative

[spoiler] we are literally shutting off an entire city of people's life support, and for some reason they are all fine with it...? [/spoiler]i had expectations, not for the content of the story, but for the quality and depth of the writing and dawntrail completely misses the mark. the problem is NOT the stakes of the story being ""too low"" or the fact that there is new characters, it's how it's executed. its unbelievably amateur and not the kind of storytelling i've grown to expect from this game.",1722186221,23,0,negative

For example, it’s hard to believe that the Final Days, a global event, didn’t reach Tural. The story seems off, especially given that the younger generation is portrayed as eager for conflict. Zoraal Ja’s comment about peace lasting too long doesn’t match the global scale of the Final Days, which were worse than war. Overall, the narrative feels disjointed.Wuk Lamat’s character writing is particularly problematic. I liked her in Endwalker, but her portrayal in Dawntrail is poorly handled. It feels like the game is forcing players to like her, and the shift in her character is jarring and disappointing.Additionally, many quests revolve around Wuk Lamat, even when it would make more sense to involve characters like Erenville, Krile, or Alphinaud. The objectives often stem from their ideas rather than Wuk Lamat’s, making the focus on her feel misplaced. The story should balance attention among all characters, including Krile and Erenville, who were shown to have significant roles in Endwalker.While I’m unhappy with the current state of the expansion and might consider asking for a refund, I understand the need for it to progress the storyline.

The character is boring, a Mary Sue, and the WHITE VA tries to do an accent of unknown origin... Along with other things. Also I found out that the character spoke 7000 WORDS... about 3-4 thousand more than the next character. The graphical update was hyped up unless you really stare at certain things, but you really can't tell. Honestly, the only thing I really noticed was the lighting which really only peaks on older content that you try and compare. The new 2 dyed gear seems underwhelming and most gear pieces do not have it. The story was really upsetting. I don't remember much from ARR but I recall there was more interesting elements from the original story 10 YEARS AGO. Also I glaze/forget the mundane parts of the story and really pay attention to the foreshadowing elements/deep lore and there were moments that seemed promising but almost all eventually led to dead ends. We didn't get left with much at the end of the story. The music choice seemed strong at some points and weak at others. But they took the Disney approach by adding a song you would imagine to have a dance choreography tied in with it. The areas in the world were hyped up to be massive, and they ARE MASSIVE. Even though they are massive they seem so lifeless with less points of interest and just big murals more than an interesting world zone. If they just made every area smaller and added more interesting things to see and interact with it would be a massive improvement. Combat segments through the story is far in between and they have you do more boring fetch quests, go from point to another and speak to so and so, and the dreaded stealth quests. Also I don't have a problem with re-used assets it adds some nice color options to old gear, but it is getting really tiring. Not to mention rehashed mobs/monsters. There is a lot more to hash on but that is more for a youtube long form video.Don't get me wrong, I love Yoshi-P and his team. They are one of the last few bastions in big company game developers. I am just sorely confused on their decisions and I don't know what limitations SE and Tencent are placing on them. Also I don't know much about the story writing team, but the main story writer that has done the last 10 years of story wasn't actively partaking in this expansion. I don't know how many veteran members of any team are still there. 10 years is a long time and they just finished with a masterpiece. I can't imagine how many people are willing to do another 10 years. Maybe they are training the next generation of developers? They have so much time but deceptively not much funding. What is taking up a lot of their time? What is being scrapped? There is a lot of past content they just skipped over or took a shortcut on. There is many thoughts and its really tiring and I don't have the mental capacity to put it in a steam review. It just seems like they are lost, or maybe they are cooking. If only we can talk to these developers face to face to understand their dilemma. Other than that the fights and combat in this expansion is really good. The new themes are refreshing but could be fleshed out more. Its a whole new feeling but has me worried. The stuff that shines do shine, but the issues are evident.",1722036971,8,0,negative

I hate the monetization.First of all: We have to pay for the base game and latest expansion, which is understandable. After that we have the subscription fee we have to pay every month to get to play, its understandable because they need money to develop more content and keep the servers up.But then... they hold quality of life features behind paywalls. (Like extra bank space and ability to put retainers on ventures when you are offline with your phone (these are not one time purchase btw. you have to pay each month)).  And stuff like mounts that represent in-game bosses and cool outfits which they clearly put lot of development time into are bought with real money instead of making them available in the game. Players are talking about the lack of rewards from endgame content meanwhile Square is putting the cool looking outfits and mounts to the store because they want more money even tho the game itself is selling very well?I hate that my favorite game is owned by a greedy corporation. It's clear these decisions are not even made by the development team, its the shareholders who want the game to print more money.So, in the end its a really good game. These complaints are not the end of the world. I wouldn't have wasted years of my life playing a bad game.

Bakool Ja Ja, though, is a very polished character and his voice actor is amazing! good job on this one. but overall, this expansion is not worth it. the graphics update is barely noticeable. it does shine in some areas and dungeon but nothing really amazing. This game is getting old and feels like they are milking it. Endwalker was the ending of this MMO and they should have worked on a newer and more polished MMO instead. I'd love FF17 or FF18 to be a new revamped MMO with all the knowledge they gained from this game. At this point, even the bad guys are acknowledging that we are litterally a killer of gods and they would not win fighting us, what's the point even. this game is almost 15 years old right now. I mean, just like the story told us, everything has an end and Endwalker would have been a good ending point for this game. Continuing this MMO was not a good option. I would have liked some new raids and very small stories related to the whole ARR-EW instead of starting a new journey that is going to lead nowhere. I do love this game a lot, I met some of my best friends in this game and even got to see them in real life and I cherish this game for it. But this game needs an end for real, even tho this would break my heart. It's for the better of the FF14 team and us the players. You had such an amazing experience through and through and you go mess it all up with a bad story and barely noticeable graphic upgrade. Now, the memories we will have of this game is the bad quality we had with Dawntrail... it's a shame. I really hope they change their mind and doesn't continue this horrible story that they are building. get us a REAL fresh new story with a NEW engine. A new MMO even more polishing than what FF14 gave us. I know they can do it and I 100% believe they would deliver.I'm posting this bad review with all the love I have for this game and because I care a lot about it. I want the better for us and for the FF14 team. Thank you for all the years of good content. I hope this gets to the FF14 team, I know they read reviews and I hope they would consider my opinion, as small as it is. I'm just a random guy on the internet, but I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking this way. Thank you for reading. <3 I hope I can open your eyes. FF14 need to rest now.",1722022095,13,0,negative

If you play for story, please bear this in mind. I love this game historically, but this was the first major misfire for me.It's disappointing because again, the dungeons and areas are some of the best we've seen.

It feels like they went in without any supervision or care. A scuffed version of the previous expansions, and massively oversight into what made their stories so great. I also played Dawntrail with the JP dub, so my experience was still better because of that. But...[b]I wished I had skipped it entirely. [/b]I'm enjoying the side-quests more because at least they acknowledge my character's existence. Also, it is the missing potential that this ""vacation"" expansion would have to develop the side characters (the Scions) that we learned to like and be interested in, only for them to be pushed to the background and completely forgotten. Instead, it appears that the entire main development team went on a vacation themselves and overlooked this issue. [b]The Scions are only here because they needed NPCs to fill for Duty Support.[/b]That aside, I think the gameplay, music, graphics, zones, dungeons, and raids are superb and on par with what they have been developing since previous expansions. The difficulty is great and some of the new mechanics are a welcome approach to an already stale formula that I believe will not hold to the next expansion, but as for now, it is still accepted.In short. I knew this expansion would be a ""filler"" story between the major arcs. But still got disappointed. It's only because I hold this game in such high regard that I want it to improve in every aspect.

76561197968291152,0,0,english,"I went into this Expansion hoping that it is at least better than A Realm Reborn, so my bar was quite low of what to expect from Dawntrail. But sadly after I went through everything that is available so far, I can only recommend it if you really don't care about the story and just want to fight stuff, because the fights (design wise and the new mechanics that they are trying) are amazing (EX1 has my favorite tankbuster of all time), and I absolutely loved the area design. The soundtrack is decent too, though I don't think the Tuliollal music (day&night) fits a city that gives me Aztec/Maya vibes, but you hear some smooth jazz as if you just entered New Orleans.So what went wrong? Was SE too short staffed cause they were busy with the graphical update (Which in some cases they did really poorly, Xaella scales looked as if someone sneezed on the design blueprint and didn't noticed it, but that's at least fixed now, I will still hold them accountable for poor QA, same as with the benchmarks)?  Spread too thin because of FF16 development? FF14 is still your main moneymaker, was SE just fine of winging it and just putting something together cause it will sell anyways, bold move if that's the case to not put in 100% or more for something that literally keeps the company afloat. How characters were written, how the story unfolds, not just the msq, but the classquests as well.... quality wise you find a better level of writing in an introductory creative writing class in college, maybe even lower. I have 15k hours in FF14, completed almost everything the game has, even reading all the sidequests, but this expansion made it that I started skipping things cause they were so painful to read or hear in some cases (example jobquests, if we compare them to what joy Shb and EW delivered instead). If I wasn't invested as I am in FF14, I 100% would have refunded it after the first few hours, that's how bad the experience of the first few hours doing the new MSQ was, but we always hope things get better (talking to others how they liked it and what they expect for the future), well the hope for that and that they will do a 180 and deliver us a quality story that SE is known for, hoping for better times won't last long before players start to leave. And no the current difficulty is not too hard, learn to observe mechanics and you will figure it out after a few pulls.Overall a TLDR statement I would make is:Final Fantasy 14, ARR - Endwalker has been our Mass Effect, a classic, loved by many by how good it was for its time, and still is.Dawntrail on the other hand, Mass Effect Andromeda, not just from the quality of the whole expansion (again, if you just are interested in combat, it's great) but also how patterns crystallised out while doing the MSQ, it had so much repetition (Example last area  [spoiler]You have the pattern of meeting and help 2 people to ""get to know them better before you shut down the terminal, you do this 4 times""[/spoiler]) so it also resembles the one dimensional visiting a planet and doing the same thing on each and every one of them.As it is right now, the only reason I still even play is because of the people I know and hold dear to me that I met, be it friends or fc, but the motivation to log in just to play if I wasn't asked by them isn't there currently, and I rather play anything else and possibly enjoy my time there.",1721946585,13,0,negative

On the flip-side the story is shockingly bad, riddled with poorly written characters, plotholes, childish themes, recycled elements from previous expansions but done poorly, no emotional connectivity, glacial pacing, more visual novel (even in FF14 which has always been talk heavy) and your Warrior of Light reduced to a baggage carrier for the writer's fanfic main character.If you're a story-skipper you'll have no problems but it's hard to ignore the story in what is supposed to be THE premiere story-based MMO. Let me be clear this isn't just about it being a change of pace, a holiday expansion, its just shockingly bad writing, there's a difference, the quality is sub-ARR.

Even in the first half, which I generally liked, pacing was agonisingly slow.2: overedependence on Wuk Lamat. I love her but she occupied the screen so much that it was at the detriment of other characters acting in the story, and once you reach the expansion's second half, the writers don't know what to do with her. She's always there, but never has anything to do, so she just gawks.3: something goes badly, BADLY wrong in the expansion's second half. It reaches a conclusion after the 95 dungeon, and then it restarts, but... worse. I could go into detail but I'd be here all day, suffice it to say it's BAD. Virtually every writing mistake it could make, it does. By the time I'd hit the level 98 content I desperately wanted it to be over, to the point that I started skipping cutscenes, something I've never done before in my time with FFXIV. So much padding, so much pointless exposition, so much repeated information, so little consequence, so little interrogation of the story's own ideas and themes.Dawntrail's combat is fun but its story is alarmingly awful.

It's such a shame that the crazily talented people who worked in these departments had all that squandered by what feels like a bunch of interns. In particular, that some tunes remind me of Grim Fandango of all things is a huge highlight. This story, and the voice acting for it, are embarrassingly bad and bafflingly amateur for a company with a market cap in the billions. I want to join in the chorus to help shake awake a clearly complacent team. It is so abundantly obvious that there was barely any communication between the two voice-acting studios, to the point where a two-headed character has two completely different levels of compression for each head. Sure, if you don't hear these kind of things, you might not notice - but it's nails on chalkboards for me every single time we hop between the wildly different levels of recording quality. The original studio continues to deliver fantastic work and great performances, and then you have some dude phoning in this flat drawl that gets crunched down to be half as dynamic as the person who spoke five seconds before him. The newer studio, which I guess is US-based, feels like it's five friends who can do cartoonishly bad hispanic accents, and you'll hear the same 4 voices for multiple side and central characters. If this was an indie title, I mean, whatever - but it isn't, and it really doesn't help the worldbuilding when you hear the exact same accent, with the exact same strained and forced ticks, being used for 3 separate characters in the same 10-minute cutscene, after which you walk a solid 5 feet and get treated to another one. And while you might be tricked into thinking that Latin America has a rich and storied history with a ton of material that you could source into your sprawling, massive fantasy world which has up until this point eagerly absorbed plenty of other cultures, it apparently boils down to tacos, alpacas, mezcal, two or three stupid accents, and lamely attempting to repeat things that previous expansions already did, and already did better. And to touch on the favorite punching bag: Wuk Lamat's voice actor drops the weird, strained accent every third quest and has absolutely zero range. This character has all the chutzpah of a coughed-on sandwich. Actually, was this entire expansion some kind of cryptofascist 4d chess effort to convince people that stories about overcoming cultural differences have to be abhorrently boring and laughably detached from reality?

But the enjoyment of the writing was enough to tolerate the mundane game play. With Dawntrail, the Main Scenario Quest retains the mundane game play while introducing questionable writing. The writing can be describe as essentially a expansion long Beast Tribe Quest.Dawntrail also has the misfortune of being forever interlinked with Wuk Lamat as a character. The writers were bold enough to explicitly state that Wuk Lamat inspires the player character during a story critical moment, while also having her relying on the player character for help the entire expansion. The English Localization team also deserves criticism for allowing Wuk Lamat to be so poorly voiced. The phrase, ""SPHEEENNEE"" will forever be associated with the combination of poor writing and voice acting for Wuk Lamat.",1721747232,34,1,negative

If you typically resubscribe just to play story content, then don't bother with Dawntrail at this point and watch a summary on youtube instead. The story writing for this expansion was absolutely abysmal. It's as if the people writing the MSQ only had a surface-level summary of the game and characters involved, and the scions are tagging along for the sole reason of having bodies for the duty support system. Probably my biggest gripe is how nobody in Tural seems to have been affected by, or even acknowledge the existence and impact of, the huge global catasrophes in both the recent and distant past. The 'history' of Tural is basically just the last ~80 years with Daddy Ja Ja, and giants did something thousands of years ago but have been sitting on their butts since then. The Final Days? Never heard of her. The previous 7 umbral calamaties? Who?Many people compare Wuk Lamat to Lyse, however I'd say she's more like ARR-patches Alphinaud. The writers certainly forgot that ""moderation is key"" with this one; there was way too much Wuk Lamat and 'peace', 'history', and 'culture' shoved into the script almost every other sentence for 20+ hours. Krile was supposed to get some growth and spotlight in this expansion, but she got very little screentime in the scope of things and what they DID give her was very poorly executed. Same could be said for Erenville. On the bright side, the battle content is pretty great!

76561198175868742,0,0,english,"New dungeons/raids are much better than last expansion, I really appreciate that.MSQ was terrible for a few reasons:1. Lots of fetching/trivial quests in the first half of the story. These quests don't contribute much to story building and are mostly just a waste of time. I was really hyped at the start, but when I reached lvl 93 I was already so bored due to all the walking and fetching. Really reminds me of ARR, and I thought XIV moved away from this formula of story progression a long time ago.2. Too many unnecessary cutscenes. I won’t mind if the cutscenes are actually important for storytelling, but half the time it’s not. It was cutscene - walk somewhere else to talk to another character about random stuff - cutscene, rinse and repeat. Before Dawntrail, whenever there’s a cutscene, I know they’re gonna say something important. Now I just feel like “oh crap, not another cutscene”. 3. Characters are very flat and often not explained well. I was interested in many new characters ([spoiler]Zoraal Ja, Cahciua, Krile’s parents, Ketenramm [/spoiler]) and thought the story would at least give more information/character development for them as it progresses, but they ended up either having little screen time or were only used as a tool for story progression. I remember crying multiple times towards the end of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but this time I barely felt any emotions while completing MSQ in the last map. The story never gave me enough information to make me feel connected enough to the characters involved. Even Wuk Lamat felt like a story progression tool in the last bit of MSQ. [spoiler]The Scions were only there to be problem solving tools/dungeon NPCs, and none of them had any meaningful character growth/enrichment. [/spoiler] Huge step down from the earlier expansions, really disappointing. 4. Some bad logic that spoils the mood. [spoiler]1. Wuk Lamat overusing ""power of friendship"" to tip the power scale. The final fight where she called to Sphene and the boss instantly revived Sphene’s data was such BS. I thought it can’t get any worse but then it proceeds to force me watch these two characters have a cringe ass conversation while dumbing down the difficulty of the whole fight in phase 2??? Totally killed the hype. [/spoiler] [spoiler]2. Mysterious looking item fell out of Zoraal Ja after he died, the team just stood there and waited for Sphene to do a long speech and take the key. [/spoiler] [spoiler]3. Wuk Lamat: My childhood friend’s mom died. Instead of comforting him I am more curious about how we are gonna chase Sphene. [/spoiler] [spoiler]4. Krile finally sees her parents. Was supposed to be emotional but for some reason they chose to make it a gag scene. Also, how does Graha eating a huge ice cream make it less awkward for Krile???

And of course the graphics update - even though it's not technically part of Dawntrail - is *chef's kiss*.As for the bad....The story is split up into two parts and in my opinion it suffers for it.The first half felt boring and repetitive. It's not exactly the exciting ""contest"" I thought it would be - filled with mystery and adventure - but rather half an MSQ worth of fetch quests. The second half was more interesting and had more promise, but still failed to deliver. Many payoffs and climaxes fell flat for me due it being cramped into half an MSQ. There wasn't enough of a buildup, and I wasn't given enough time to really get invested.Had the entire MSQ focused on either half of the story it could've been much more fleshed out, interesting and impactful in my opinion. Since this is meant as a new beginning - after the conclusion of the previous arc in Endwalker - my hope is that this story will at least serve as a good foundation for future MSQ to build upon. While I'm ready to bury the 7.0 story deep in my mind, I'm very much looking forward to what 7.1 and onward will do with the plot points and threads that have been introduced.Conclusion: Of course I recommend Dawntrail. The content is fun, and the MSQ - despite being disappointing - is still worth experiencing if you care about the overall story of XIV. It's a part of the greater whole and will most likely serve as an important stepping stone for future MSQ. It's introduced plenty of new plot points to get excited over.Despite this, I'll mark Dawntrail as a ""don't recommend"" purely based on the fact that the story as an experience was overall disappointing.",1721687473,15,0,negative
76561197986293674,480517,735,english,"As a long-time fan of the Final Fantasy XIV series, I had high hopes for the Dawntrail expansion. Unfortunately, this latest instalment falls short in several key areas, leaving me and many others in the community feeling underwhelmed and frustrated.Firstly, the story in Dawntrail lacks the depth and emotional resonance that previous expansions delivered so masterfully. The narrative feels disjointed and rushed, with plot points that fail to engage or surprise. The new characters introduced are largely forgettable, and their development feels shallow compared to the rich, nuanced storytelling we've come to expect from the series. It’s as if the writers were more focused on churning out content rather than crafting a compelling tale this time around. I've been reading comments where people compared the emotional impact of the final zones of Shadowbringers and Endwalker to Dawntrail, and I feel like I must have missed something. In the final zone of Dawntrail I felt absolutely nothing whilst the end zone of Endwalker brought me tears multiple times.Gameplay mechanics have also taken a hit in Dawntrail. The new jobs and abilities introduced in this expansion seem poorly balanced and, in some cases, uninspired. The much-anticipated changes to existing classes have left many players feeling frustrated, as the reworks often simplify gameplay to the point of making it feel dull and repetitive. The combat system, once a complex and rewarding aspect of FFXIV, now feels like it’s been dumbed down, reducing the satisfaction of mastering your role.I found the English Voice Acting to be really bad direction-wise. Most of it was really flat and generally unemotional from almost all characters. This is the first expansion I switched to Japanese Voice Acting.So far Dawntrail does excel in delivering endgame content that is both challenging and interesting. The extremes are meticulously designed and the expert dungeons are more inetresting than previous expansions so far to make up a little bit of the now stale job designs.FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail is a disappointing expansion that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. With a lackluster story, uninspired gameplay changes, and technical issues, it’s hard to recommend this expansion to even the most dedicated fans of the series. Here’s hoping the developers take the feedback to heart and address these shortcomings in future updates. I think I will give this expansion a pass, it feels uninspired and hasn't really vibed with me.",1721686790,161,1,negative

Even after *Spoiler Not really* a certain character's death, our WoL just stand there and do nothing. Some of the quests and cutscenes are way too long and add nothing to the story.

Análise feita depois de jogar a expansão inteira, upar algumas classes pro 100, fazer as trials extremes (finalmente consegui a montaria da 1, só falta a da 2 agora) e tryhardar para conseguir virar omnicrafter no 100 e omnigatherer no 100 com os novos equipamentos pentameld, devo ter por volta de 250+ horas nessa expansão no momento da análise (férias da faculdade é algo maravilhoso) . ATT 7.01Gostaria de pontuar antes de falar mal até da alma da expansão: eles realmente se prepararam para o lançamento, quase todas as regiões com 6 instâncias foi algo surpreendente, filas com no máximo 50 pessoas foi algo lindo, acho que isso foi o melhor lançamento de uma expansão que já presenciei no mundo dos mmos.Algumas opiniões:Expansão inteira focada na Wuk Lamat, tudo bem até o rito dela e tudo mas, depois disso ela simplesmente vem interromper a batalha final e da mais dano que qualquer player.Vozes em inglês parecem um pouco forçadas em certos momentos para ter algo parecido com um sotaque da américa do sul, não sei se os VA realmente são do sul ou não, mas que esse sotaque em alguns personagens (vilão principal, wuk lamat, outros) pareceu forçado em certas cutscenes pareceu.Quests principais se resumem em: fale com wuk lamat, pegue item aqui, fale com wuk lamatx3. Antes do nível 97 a história principal parece algo de filme da disney de tão tosca que é. Eu senti que as quests da expansão shadowbringers foram muito mais impactantes por exemplo.Em resumo, a história principal é fraca, arrastada, podem até falar que o WoL não é para ser principal mas, é tanta coisa besta que poderia ser resolvida e pontos soltos que parece que quem escreveu não lembrou fazendo a msq virar isso daí, se você não gosta da wuk lamat é melhor jogar com o jogo sem volume e pular todas as cutscenes mas, infelizmente, na ÚLTIMA TRIAL ela simplesmente aparece e luta sozinha e o esforço do WoL vai pro caralho, fodase.Acho que chega já de coisas negativas, aqui estão as coisas que eu achei que ficaram bem feitas:- Trials e raids simplesmente maravilhosas, aqui a dificuldade é elevada e tem algo que não gosto muito: errou alguma mecânica = morre, sinto que isso acaba deixando os healers com menos presença pra healing e mais como só um mago de rez. Tirando isso que falei agora as lutas estão realmente muito boas, tanto em som quando mecânicas;- Dungeons estão boas e com um nível de dificuldade um pouco mais elevado também: mas tbm nada de morrer 3x pra um w2w, só que agora healers tem que jogar o jogo mesmo.  Algumas dungeons tem um mini boss antes do boss que realmente só serve de esponja de dano, achei bem esquisito isso e não concordo muito com tal decisão;- Trilha sonora excelente;Pontos mais ou menos:- Gráficos... estão melhores mas, ainda acho que poderia melhorar bem mais, tirando as texturas qualquer ReShade da um pau nessa iluminação atual;- 2ChannelDyes: sistema de 2 cores é legal mas, é uma vergonha ver um jogo do tamanho do final fantasy 14 só colocar isso agora enquanto outros mmos tem até 4 channel dyes, sem contar que alguns itens que possuem 2 cores não fazem sentido, em uma cor vc pinta o item inteiro e na outra vc pinta os fios dos botões, sério que deixaram isso passar?- Balanceamento de classes: parece que não testaram nenhuma mudança de classe, tanto que em duas semanas já tiveram que lançar um patch consertando trocentas classes, e mesmo assim black mage continua uma merda, fizeram um trabalho tão ruim nessa classe que não consigo descrever em palavras como estou chateado, é comum ver gente que trocou black mage por picto já que picto é uma classe forte que não do mesmo nível de habilidade de blm, só não falo que é mais fácil que summoner pq ai já até estaria desmerecendo um pouco.TLDR: expansão com história fraca, personagens desinteressantes, balanceamento geral de classes ruins, combates no geral ótimos, trilha sonora boa, sistema de tintas e gráficos novos deixaram bem a desejar.Mesmo que eu não recomende a expansão infelizmente ela é necessária para a progressão mas, aqui deixo meu descontentamento, espero que no futuro ela melhore e eu venha aqui mudar minha análise.",1721624270,0,0,negative

Koanas party is on a random island to sabotage for us and nothing else really because when we clear it we find out we are stuck anyways, Then our boat comes to us repaired. we might have just as well stayed on the boat and helped with the repairs and been on our way. The bird people that forgot about their own traditions until Wuk Lamat goes ""maybe do that thing you stopped doing"" and Wuk Evu already knew this but he didn't wanna help them because of the challenge? the music choice at the very end before the credits was not good, that song felt so out of place too.Wuk Lamat.i did really love her in post endwalker and was really excited to see how she would evolve through the story.

She really feels like a very flat Naruto with the ""i will be hokage"" personality that changes to a ""i am the hokage"".

This ""expansion"" commits the two most egregious sins that an RPG could do: It does not respect your time and shoehorns an unlikable npc to the forefront while relegating you as a pet to be dragged all over creation with little to no agency on your part including dialogue choices and railroading your experience to the point where it's 90% cutscenes and 10% gameplay.There's also the issue of what exactly was ""new"" as far as story, because as far as what I was able to glean there were an excruciating number of items that were copied and pasted from previous expansions:NPC that was focused on - Lyse from StormbloodAntagonist committing morally reprehensible things to ""save their people"", fusing worlds, manipulating others for their own ends over a period of many years : Emet-Selch from ShadowbringersMain quests involving looking at farming: Loporrits from EndwalkerMedieval looking areas: Several places in Heavensward, Shadowbringers and EndwalkerAntagonist that kills his own soldiers cause reasons: Zenos The stupid trope of letting the bad guy walk away: Too many instances to countReused assets in the environments and areas clearly designed to look like Twilight Town from Kingdom HeartsA villain in green with a magic crown that devours souls and is an obvious manipulator: Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat. I am not even kidding about this one. Let's talk about those cutscenes for a moment because I just re-watched TheRussianBadger's Fallout: New Vegas video because I needed to be reminded of what good storytelling is and realized something: Nearly all of the dialogue in New Vegas is voiced, and that game is 14 years old. Want to know how much of the cutscenes in Dawntrail are voiced? Barely any of them. What exactly was the excuse for that? Did they only have an hour to record all the voice lines in the rented studio booth or something? I often found myself feeling bad for friends of mine who put their heart and soul into their work, meanwhile the VA for wuk is barely qualified to work at a drive-thru for Wendy's, yet some of the side characters (such as Bakool, Koana and the train depot NPC's) have much better VA work which makes you wonder who the hell was in charge of casting and directing. There was absolutely no excuse for the piss poor performance nor the lack of voiced cutscenes for how many there were. On top of that, the fight choreography for the fight scenes (far and few between as there were) was abysmal with 900 cuts for less than a minute that harkens back to the Taken 3 meme of a dozen cuts needed for climbing a fence. And speaking of the sound, usually the OST in each expansion has a ton of memorable tracks, but Dawntrail? I can count maybe 3-4 tracks I enjoyed and the rest were either white noise or just insufferable such as the wailing church chorus once you beat the final boss. Oh and let's not forget the bug of needing to disable the audio enhancement effects in order for the voiced cutscenes to actually be heard. There's also the manner of reused tracks for all of those cutscenes, most of which were inappropriate to the tone as well and it really just breaks what little immersion to be had since there's a ridiculous amount that you have to sit through. Circling back to wuk, ever since Lyse in Stormblood I have not seen an npc so deservedly and actively despised and you would've thought SE would've learned by now not to do that again, and yet here we are. Shoehorned into nearly every scene, forced to be dragged along like an npc ourselves to every interaction to the absurdly forced scene where she ""somehow"" breaks through a dome to appeal to the final boss' emotions like an episode of steven universe, and I've been struggling to figure out who this npc was supposed to appeal to because it sure as hell wasn't the playerbase. Honestly the main character should've been Koana because as shallow as the character's writing was, he at least has some worthwhile growth, hell even Bakool has some growth and again extremely shallow but at least redeemable and even dare I say likeable towards the end. Meanwhile wuk throws a pity party every 2 minutes, doesn't show any qualifications to being a qualified leader other than just listening to people, never shuts the hell up and thinks that making people smile is the most important aspect of solving a nation's issues. This really feels like a bait and switch con job, especially when we were told that this was supposed to be a lower stakes vacation expansion with competition involving the Scions, yet what we got was tumblr-level writing trying to make you care with overloaded sap, bad jokes and stuck on a leash being led around by the worst story-focused npc in the game's history relieving Lyse of that long-held crown. Whoever is in charge of staff: relegate the writers, sound editors, cutscene editors and quest makers of Dawntrail to side quests where they belong, start bringing in competent people and fix this problem before it gets any worse than it already is. I'm sure there's a lot of stuff I've missed in this review but long story short this is a travesty and an insult to both longtime players of this series and just anyone in general who enjoys storytelling, especially with the release of Elden Ring's dlc just shortly before this was released. Once again, tl;dr if you're in this for just the combat, trials, dungeons, crafting, collectibles, it might be worth your time.

76561198043629477,0,0,english,"I've played this game for over 10 years now and Dawntrail's story is an insult to anyone that plays this game. I expected a cool vacation/Road to El Dorado kind of story arc alongside the scions, your friends, whom you saved the world with, with hi-jinks and adventure. None of that happened. Instead, you and your friends are all in the back seat of the Wuk Lamat-mobile. They have maybe one or two lines in a scene just to remind you they are still there but otherwise you're stuck watching Wuk Lamat make a fool of herself. Y'shtola's (NA) lines seemed like they were literally phoned in?? Her audio quality is noticeably poorer next to characters she's talking to? What happened?? Additionally, Krile has a vested interest in the new world. Yet she receives maybe a story beat or two pertaining to her origins and her grandfather. For the rest, Wuk Lamat dominates the screen-time, and that screen-time is just SO boring. I found myself skipping through several parts just to get it over with, or falling asleep at its density. The first half of the expansion is just absolutely mindless fetch quests and exposition dumps. You do the tedious quests in the zone for the story's challenge and immediately after you finish, one of the other claimants walks up and has an instant solution to your hour-long fetch quest. And in another zone you have a cooking contest. How was this story approved?This expansion leans too heavily on its brother, Shadowbringers, to be cool. There are many moments in the later half of the story that DT shouts at you ""Hey remember THIS part from Shadowbringers?? Wasn't that cool?? Here is the source version! How cool am I? Like me please!"" DT feels like it doesn't want to stand on its own and will remind you of that fact.Wuk Lamat is possibly the worst character I've ever come across. The writer's perfect furry OC is stapled to your hip throughout the main story. Every minute of every quest you are FORCED to spend with Wuk Lamat. You aren't even mentoring her, you stand there, doing bunk-all. Her NA voice is pure nails on a chalkboard kind of awful and amature. She claims to want to protect peace, but thats never defined or explored, but don't worry, she'll remind you endlessly of this empty promise. The game reminds you constantly to care about Wuk Lamat and her quest ""because reasons!"" Only in the last third does an actual threat against the world emerge and you start doing what you do best does the story get more interesting. But even during the FINAL BOSS, where its YOUR time to shine, Wuk Lamat STILL manages to steal the spotlight. To her credit she at least shares the crown with her brother who isn't a complete dunce. The zones are...fine, but several are far too gray. The big-band jazz for Tuliyolal is... a choice. The last zone just makes no sense, why make a colorful theme park to just tear it away from you? I understand the symbology plot-wise, but now i get to visit a bunch of gray rust islands for the next 3 years?Dungeons are great! Inventive, fresh mechanics are always a welcome addition.The new jobs are fairly fun as well, good if you like busywork.The graphic update is also great, a fresh coat of paint on the ageing MMO feels good.I love this game.

It's a sign of the things to come, endless moments of Wuk Lamat being fellated by the story for achievements she only has minor, if any at all, credit to. Her character flaws, if you want to call them such, are fairly mild jokes about her easily becoming seasick, and the game will try its hardest to not let you forget about this and other ""interesting"" character attributes. Her naivete and genuinely dangerous (for a potential country leader) idealism is not shown as proper weakness, but supposedly misunderstood strength. Speaking of strength, she is also easily the strongest NPC in the game, dealing more damage than the entire party combined during the last phase of the final trial, capable of firing off multiple LB3s AND able to give the WoL the traditionally unique buff he needs to overcome all odds, something that was previously reserved for only the mightiest beings and emotional climaxes. In one scene, she not only steals our thunder, but also becomes stronger and more inspiring than all of the Scions and other side characters combined. During the entire story, nobody questions her beliefs, barely anyone dares to even speak up in regards to her actions and when they do they almost immediately get proven to be stubborn, evil or stupid. Almost every scene is either Wuk Lamat talking or someone else talking about Wuk Lamat. She's not just the focus of this expansion, she is quite literally the exclusive main character, having more lines of dialogue than almost the entire remaining cast combined. In a time when people misuse the term ""Mary Sue"" quite a lot, Wuk Lamat actually fits that archetype shockingly well, and I'm a bit bewildered that I haven't seen anyone call her such yet. For the third time in my 10-years journey with this game I was genuinely tempted to skip cutscenes. Only Stormblood, with its utter stupidity, and the Endwalker patch series, with Zero the Hedgehog, have achieved this so far. Hiroi is a terrible, awful writer and as long as he is in any position to majorly influence the story of this game it will only get worse.

Every other character, including yourself, is pushed aside for this over the top character that slowly grates at your sanity until by the end you just wish she'd go away. In the beginning of the story she's fun to be around and explore the lands with, learning more about her and the people around her, I was genuinely enjoying my time and felt invested and connected to her story, by about level 95-96 I was thankful we split off from her. Just for her to return, shoe-horned and pushed into the story at every single point. The story on its own is frankly tedious to get through, but combined with the fact Wuk is pushed in your face every single time it got to the point where I was half-skipping over Wuk's lines as they were that predictable. I really hope we're done with her now.If Wuk wasn't in the second ""arc"" of DT, it has a lot of potential to be interesting, with some of the 'minor' side characters having more emotional connection and lore that you care about than the 'main cast'.The gameplay in DT is great too, the actual content and dungeons have challenge, unlike EW which put you to sleep with the trivial difficulty, the music is wonderful and its a huge shame the entire thing is tainted by the awful writing and the medicore voice acting at times.TLDR:Great ""content"", terrible MSQ, and as a primarily story focused MMO, I can't recommend DT's story or characters.

76561198079504369,0,0,english,"This base expansion felt like a hard miss for me story wise, which is disappointing for an MMORPG that touts its story as a major selling point. The story feels like a moral story made for children: you're constantly reminded of the overarching familial theme of the expansion and it is constantly shoehorned as the end all be all solution to all of the problems. There is no moral quandary, no physical threat, nothing that can beat the power of family. While that is fine in most JRPGs, the sheer amount of times that it felt repeated in this expansion with barely any breaks in between felt draining. I also felt like it leaned too heavily on mirroring the dilemma of previous expansions and not in a good way, it made the story feel like an unoriginal spinoff that did previous ideas worse in my opinion. The Voice Acting for certain characters felt to be of low quality, specifically Wuk Lamat's voice during dramatic scenes fell short and a certain Scion's English voice later also felt like it was super soft spoken through a tin can. In addition, I think overall the expansion suffered from both simultaneously too many cutscenes (voiced and unvoiced) and too few important cutscenes that were voiced. There is a staggeringly large amount of cutscenes this expansion, but a lot of them felt like they were used to repeat the same information over and over that it artificially extended the expansion length and add nothing of importance to the story. Also there were quite a number of important unvoiced cutscenes following a voiced segment which made me wish that they cut down the sheer quantity of cutscenes and just had quality voiced cutscenes for important scenes rather than suddenly switching between voiced and unvoiced at the drop of a hat while giving important information out. It was jarring to have a character be speaking to you the suddenly in the next second they are a mute in the same conversation.Overall the expansion zones look beautiful and I had a blast running through them, but I strongly dislike the visual direction the later half of the story took, too many bosses and arenas look identical in the last 3 main story quest dungeons. There are plot reasons for this but at the same time it still cheapened the experience for me as running those dungeons to level future classes is less enjoyable as a lot of visual distinction is lost.Combat mechanics are improved in this expansion, there are some great QoL changes, the new jobs are fun among other things, but I just felt like the story was so disappointing this time around not only in writing but also production quality wise that I would not recommend this expansion if you only play for the story. If you play the game to raid and other things, obviously this expansion offers that but if you can be patient and wait for 8.0 story it might be worth the wait.

I can't express enough how bad the story and characters of this expansion is. If you haven't played it yet, nothing can prepare you for how utterly garbage it is, I genuinely recommend skipping each and every cutscene in the entire expansion, with the only exception possibly being the first visit to Shaaloni, as its actually somewhat decent likely due to it being the only part of the story where we are blessed with the absence of one of the most annoying and cringe characters in the known cosmos.That character being Wuk Lamat, the main writer's self-insert OC Mary Sue. This budget-Naruto wannabe will force itself on screen anywhere they can, whether they belong or not. They will never stop spewing garbage about how all we need is peace and love, that to understand each other and being friends grants us the power of friendship, and how they will be the next Hokage- I mean, Dawnservant, believe it! If they gave you the option to assassinate Wuk Lamat, me and most others would do so in a heartbeat. It's only fair; after all, she's been desperately trying to kill the player character with cringe with every cutscene she's in.I could go into great detail over how the other characters suck too, adressing the inconsistent behaviours, character assassinations and go into detail how much of the ""plot"" makes no sense and has various plotholes, but I won't, as it would be way shorter to note the positives of the story and characters in this game, than the negatives. Frankly, this expansion deserves to be repressed in the deepest confines of the collective subconscious, and the development team should honestly offer a public apology for delivering such a disrespectfully awful product at full price, and last but not least; fire every single person on the writing team for this expansion. You might think I'm being too harsh or extreme or that I'm exaggerating, but if you play this expansion you will come to realize that this isn't just a bad expansion; it's abhorrent, its a stain on the legacy of this game as a whole.Some people claim this expansion gets good at the 30% mark, 50%, 70% or 90%. I've played through the entirety of it, and I can assure you it's all garbage, but I will give credit where credit is due; only the first 50% of this game is loaded with cringe, while the remaining 50% just being plain boring, tedious and bad (with the exception of the final trial, where they made sure to shoehorn in an extra large dose of cringe to make sure you hate this expansion and the character Wuk Lamat with a heartfelt passion).At least the music is good. The dungeons are excellent. The open-area zones are pretty good.Which is why this is the first time in this game's history where I recommend skipping cutscenes. If you skip every cutscene of this expansion, you will probably enjoy it a lot.

But in definitely could've been much better.I don't mind some other character to be a main protagonist of an expansion (Lyse was fine).When said protagonist is annoying and shoved in every nook and cranny, steals spotlight not only from you (the main character of the game) but from the side characters as well, it's a bad writing. Other characters barely got any screentime to shine.And that's because Wuk Lamat is poorly written.Another part of it - villains. Or lack there of. We got few smaller foes which are excused from their misdeeds because they had their own MOTIVATION. Excused and forgiven right away. Are we supposed to feel sorry for murderers? No, that's not how proper villains work.[b]Music[/b] has very few tracks. And even fewer noticable ones. It lacks character. And when it doesn't, it's replaced by ARR music. Quite often I might add. When I arrived to 4th Wild West zone, I couldn't help myself but turn on Crisis Core's ""[b]Wandering on a sunny afternoon[/b]"" and ""[b]Moonlight wandering[/b]"". Because Crisis Core's music fits MUCH BETTER for that zone.They could've gone into spaghetti western feel for music and added harmonica into that soundtrack or some other instruments like jaw harp. But nah. It's just average uninspired guitar/piano music. It's there.Capital city of Tuliyollal has jazz music. Why jazz music for Mayan/Mexican inspired city? Why can't we have some more fitting Spanish fiesta or something like that?[b] Dungeon/Trail mechanics [/b] are bullshit. Not all of them but some. You gotta scan boss area in 360 degrees every second to see what's coming. Or watch/read a guide. And instead of showing mechanic incoming with visuals like wind or aoe marker, SE decided to put just a small red text on top of a screen. Enjoy reacting in time to that if you're a slow reader.[b] Job changes [/b] is what killed a few of the jobs I enjoyed. Dragoon can't goon no more. They removed OGCD damage jump skill with average slide to enemies skill with no damage. Dragoon's main thing is to jump like a bullet onto enemies and pierce them with lance. But we can't do that no more. As well as we can't have a damage boost to ourselves and one teammate. Black mage is another one who received poor treatment. It was at peak in EW with few ways to recover your rotation. Now it's only one way. Ice no longer passively returns mana. You can't cast lighting skills without proc. Ice paradox is gone.[b] Expansion doesn't even feel like one[/b]. There. I said it. Dawntrail doesn't feel like an expansion to me personally. Even post Endwalker patch story feels more like an expansion. Nothing really exciting happens. It's like ARR all over again and we are nothing but a newbie adventurer. Pray return to WUKing Sands. When cutscene tries to be funny and even has funny music, nothing funny actually happens. When cutscene tries to be touching, nothing really touching actually happens. Same stuff with inspiring music. It tries to hype us up with ARR music but nothing worth noting actually happens.It's hollow through and through. As a start of new post-Zodiark saga it's a miss for me.Yoshi-P, please return Natsuko Ishikawa as a main writer.

You, as the main character, take a dramatic back seat to the story to become a yes-man and a hired muscle. Taking away the focus from the player vastly reduces the investment of most player's interest in the story (myself included) because we no longer have a stake in what's going on outside of being bodyguards. The story doesn't really pick up until halfway through and by then, all the interesting parts of the MSQ felt hugely rushed because the first 20 hours of the 30 hour MSQ are spent talking to NPCs, doing fetch quests for ingredients and maybe 1 dungeon and 1 trial. There's just so much text and dialogue and inconsequential cutscenes that play that you can reasonably skip any of them that are not voiced and have all the context you need without having missed anything important and I'm saying this as someone who is a firm believer in watching every cutscene and reading every dialogue. This is the first expansion in FFXIV history to get me to skip dialogue and even some cutscenes here and there. Heck, I even fell asleep a couple times too. The voice acting is a big deal for a lot of people and while I enjoyed most of them, I found Erenville and Wuk Lamat really hard to listen to after a few hours especially when line delivery was needed to drive some semblance of emotion. I played the entire expansion in English as I often do but after the final trial and due to some very not-good line deliveries, I've reluctantly swapped to Japanese just in the off chance I get that trial in my Daily Roulette. The Pros:Dungeons are pretty par for the course but I can't complain as long as we get to wall-to-wall pull and vaporize an entire group of enemy mobs. Downside is most dungeons really amount to ""jungle and/or desert"" which isn't my favorite aesthetic but if you love those locations, you'll probably love a lot of the dungeons. Some of the better changes though have been in bosses and trials thus far which actually have some very unique mechanics that require more thought than ""dodge the big glowing orange circle"". I think what's going to be the biggest form of player retention is going to be the raids, dungeons and trials of this expansion because they really are some of the best yet or at least a small step up from what we've had before. If you're someone who doesn't really care about the story either which way and plays mostly for the end game content and the grind, the expansion is worth getting for that. If you're someone that enjoys the story and getting to see your player character get to do amazing things and interact with your other favorite characters, sadly there isn't much of that here and is a major drop off compared to what we've had before.",1721330289,3,0,negative

76561197982371681,0,0,english,"Disappointing. It's surprising how quickly this game went from it's peak experience with Endwalker to fumbling the ball hard in it's post-game content releases and landing on Dawntrail, revealing the unfortunate truth that they're out of ideas. It's of my opinion that they should have ended the game in its entirety with Endwalker and just focused on developing some stellar end game content in the interim until they decided what they would do for FFXIV-2 (or whatever they would have called it). Unless they change their tune, this game has begun it's slow death spiral where any semblance of what made the game great slowly gets phased out for the sake of change and the writing just gets worse and worse. People aren't exaggerating about the character Wuk Lumat. Her voice is particularly grating because they chose a terrible voice actor for the role who sounds like they're doing their best impression of a furry which makes it incredibly hard to take the character seriously, let alone her character development and dialogue is terrible. Same goes for the plot. When I originally started playing FFXIV, I was skipping dialogue and cutscenes because WoW had conditioned me into believing that a story in and MMO was not worth your time. I stopped that habit in Shadowbringers and was blown away by the story, even going back and revisiting the previous plot lines so I could get immersed in the world. Now I've gone right back to skipping cutscenes and dialogue because I just can't take it anymore - It's too boring. It's WAY too boring. And once you start skipping you start to see how much of the gameplay is just you running 200 meters and initiating another cutscene over and over. I'm approaching that point where I might unfortunately be done with this game. All the jobs I liked playing have either been ignored, gutted, or lost their core identity. Progression is adding another button to the bar that's just a more powerful version of an existing skill. Classes are being reworked when no one is asking for them.

76561198062662435,316351,846,english,"The actual gameplay content in this expansion is quite enjoyable overall. But it is at least in my opinion overshadowed by just how laser focused the main story quest is on a single character. No other expansion has ever revolved around a single person so much. Not even Stormblood; which was quite heavily focused on Lyse, was so extremely skewed as Dawntrail is. Which is a move that can only hope to be successful with a character that is well liked and or has already built up quite a connection with the player in the past. Which with this character being new is not possible. It is also not helped that while the Wol's role was meant to be a mentor and guide but we never really do any guiding. The only thing we ever really did that even fit that role was when she began to doubt herself or her choice, was to tell her to keep doing what she is already doing because she was already doing the right thing.Though It was not so bad as to tank the expansion at least when it seemed that the time of that characters reign was going to end at about the halfway point. It however did not and a few quests later they were back and the center of the main story quests focus once more all the way through and especially in the very end. This was the hardest blow for me as with their seemingly leaving the content left them in a mostly positive light. I was not yet overwhelmed by them at that point and could look past their lack of development and any meaningful struggle.

First of all, the main quest line is extremely boring, not because of the story itself, but rather because it's full of unnecessary filler quests. After getting to level 95, I said to myself: okay, it looks like the game is finally going to pick up. Nope, a few moments later, I was back to doing tons of dreadful filler quests. Additionally, all of your companions completely lost their personality. They all feel and talk exactly the same: ""Oh, we're always here to help. You're doing great, pal. Friends forever!""... give me a break.The quest design is also the same as it was years ago: talk with person A -> talk with person B -> talk with person A -> talk with person A again! I was okay with it in the two previous expansions, because at least the story was good. Now, it feels like I am forced to sit through a very long and boring movie with a few good moments.Additionally, the design of each expansion is exactly the same: 100 main quests, 10 more levels, 2 new classes, a few raids, grinding for relics... This starts to feel like the company takes the players for granted and is not interested in taking any risks. In my opinion, a good example is the dragoon ""rework"". The job feels as busy and chaotic as it did in the previous expansions, with some skills removed and replaced by additional ones. The healers haven't changed at all either.Not every thing is bad of course: most of the jobs are very fun to play, the new dungeons are challenging and well designed, the visual effects are enjoyable. I also don't have Wuk Lamat like everyone else :). At least she has some personality compared to your other companions!In conclusion, I still love the game.

Well I already am enjoying other games, but negative reviews are literally here to say what you think which is exactly what I'm gonna do because I've played since Stormblood.This is the worst expansion that's dropped combat wise. No I did not enjoy a single dungeon or trial due to how easy they are for me because of the game's combat ""engine"". It is FAR too simple and I am losing interest. My problem with this expansion is also the very blatant formula we're following for several expansions and that the combat and content hasn't changed and it likely won't. I don't think the game only needs ""harder"" combat, I think they need to change the combat, enemies, mechanics, roles and classes and make it far different. At most I'd prefer a whole new combat system like an ARPG instead of this chess game with no vertical movement; In the game, try to jump over a hole and land onto something else by using elusive jump on dragoon, it doesn't work because there is no verticals in combat and you'll see my biggest problem with this game. It could be fun if they expanded on mechanics like having to time jumps or adding dodges.  As an example: teleporting is not real on any class, use a ninja smoke bomb and teleport, it's a dash, not a teleport. Urianger in dungeons can properly teleport instead of dodging, showing that THEY CAN add it, they just don't want to, do the Dohn Mehg dungeon in Trust and see what he does in the final fight during the bridge mechanic. Since ShB every class feels the same and it's getting worse. If 7.2 doesn't change the game to extreme amounts that are a lot more intriguing, hard, and keeps your attention on every enemy, keeping it fun and less sleep heavy this will be my last expansion. Clown react or not, this expansion and the game is going in an awfully annoying and boring direction I don't support and I think not too far into the future other veterans will agree with me. The balancing for the classes are questionable to me, this new idea of a max amount of buttons is pathetic to me. This same loop through every expansion of 3 alliance raids, 12 normal raids and some dungeons feels lazy even if it is a lot of content. The story and the game falls apart to me when I can figure out what the next fight and how the story is going to play out just by looking at the MSQ level. There should be inconsistencies to keep everything interesting, not a content formula that everyone can pick up on through the expansions.I'll be honest, I'm a dungeon player, not a raider, I've done raiding and it's traumatizing and mentally tiring to be with 8 people, I level everything to max every expansion and this time I don't even feel for it most of the time. I like playing repetitively, I would really like to have a dungeon variant for Savage and Ultimate raids and I don't mean Criterion and Variant dungeons. I'd like mythics from WoW or Fractals from Guild Wars 2, just replaying the dungeons with modifiers, that would be fun for me and I would want that to reward you with a lot more end game tomestones and gear than what you'd get just playing normal dungeons in the end game. I know it may sound like I am tired of the game because of the dungeons, I am not, I still love the dungeons, I don't like the balancing and I want more dungeons, I just wish the dungeons had more to them than being pitifully resourceful for leveling. I do not care for other content like raids, alliance raids, trials and so on, that's for other people to enjoy, not me, they are not fun for me and I have done a decent amount of everything in all my time.Whether you agree or not, I don't care, it's my review, it's how I feel about the game. It's going down the drain for me. It's too easy and that's not because of the content, it's the combat itself that the game has always had where there's no verticality.",1721239194,16,0,negative

The graphics update was sorely needed and has genuinely overall improved the look of the game minus some nitpicks.Having said that, I play for the story and this time it was a huge miss.  It had the bones of an interesting narrative that just felt like it was squandered at every turn by an amateur writer with no idea how to write in character voice or any concept of nuance.  Wuk Lamat felt nearly like someone's 'OC don't steal' by the second half and I'm annoyed that the writers made me end out hating a character I initially liked to the point of irritation if I have to even see her face.  Over saturation and poor characterisation along with poorly directed voice lines was a disservice in every respect, to the player, the story, the character and the voice actress.  The Scions themselves felt one note and written by someone who'd heard about them.  I was genuinely looking forward to taking a backseat and playing mentor but I didn't really feel I did that either.  Also, mentoring someone to become a leader? Surely G'raha was better suited.  I should have been on a pub crawl with Estinien.The themes were presented in a manner that feels like it's catering to an audience of 8-12 year olds.  Not to say it was completely devoid of good moments.  It had one that genuinely almost felt like the previous expansions in terms of depth and character and a couple of one sided character moments but they were too brief, too few and too far between.  I have genuinely loved this game for just short of 10 years and I cannot in good faith defend this expansions writing.  I have never taken this long to complete the MSQ and I have never before arrived at the doorstep of a final trial and just turned the game off.  I was genuinely looking forward to maybe jumping back into the extremes this time round but after getting through the final trial I turned the game off and haven't been back since.  I gave it a fair go, I went in with high hopes, did not skip , avoided spoilers for the most part and went into it determined to make my own conclusions (I loved ARR and anyone who thinks it's bad is entitled to that but I genuinely do not agree even if it had some wobbly bits).  I just have had no enthusiasm and it feels empty.  There are a few side bits that I genuinely had interest in that seemed to be better written but the MSQ dampened any desire to explore the world further.  I hope the patches will be an improvement but I have issues with the story that I'm not sure it will be enough to fix.",1721121222,12,0,negative

The only difference is that now, instead of pressing your burst skill every 2 minutes, you press your burst skill twice in a row every two minutes. Combine the fact that there are zero job changes or improvements with the fact that the story is dogshit this time around and you've got a real recipe for disaster. Don't even get me started on the voice acting, this time around they left it up to the Americans and like everything else they touch, it crumbles and dies. They decided this time around to hire a transexual from Kentucky to play the role of a female latino main character, obviously this did not sound very convincing and takes you out of the game. The dialogue during the final boss fight is so poorly voice acted, it's become a meme of its own.  ---Schizo theory time---Much of the story has been very crudely cut from the final product shortly before release. I claim this simply by the fact that there are plently of obvious plotlines and implied conflicts completely removed from the release version of the game. One example I can name of the top of my head is the entire zone of ""Shaaloani"". Shaaloani is a very obvious reference to a new frontier western setting. All the characters live in crude houses and act like cowboys, the zone's story is about a bandit gang being in league with the sheriff and doing some general evil bandit stuff before facing off with... Rubber bullets...?Now, in the zone there's also an entire area dedicated to another group of people styled after a nomadic native tribe. You visit this zone for what can't be more than 10 minutes to perform a singular quest, where - completely unrelated to the storyline of the zone - the natives americans mention that they're very much upset about new cowboy people coming in and disturbing nature by building infrastructure such as trains. They explain this calmly, the cowboys go ""okay, thank you for sharing"" and then they resolve their differences...? What?What I suspect happened here is that the ever ominous ""consulting company"" Yoshi mention in a previous live letter saw the pre release version of the zone, which I imagine was a typical plot something along the lines of: The natives disagree with and sabotage technological progress of the cowboys, the cowboys retaliate since they see the natives as terrorists, they eventually reach an understanding after learning eachother's motives, they find a balance between nature and progress, applause.I can imagine the american company walking in, saying ""You can't have cowboys shooting natives and vice versa, it's ""INSENSITIVE"". Shut. It. Down."" forcing a late stage rewrite to what we have today. Thus leaving the native zone completely unused as it is now.In much the same way, I feel that the entire continet of Tural has had it's bite removed. None of the cultures displayed have any real faults, atleast not any that can't be solved with friendship and food. Leaving the world feeling empty and fake.Almost as if some american company came in and made sure that they didn't offend someone by displaying the less favorable parts of south american tribal culture...? *AHEM* Blood sacrificie *AHEM*.In the end, I feel that Dawntrail is a massive step down from the previous expansions story wise. With a main story deep as a puddle, bad voice acting getting unjustifiably defended due to the sexual orientation of the voice actor and undelivered promises from pre-release.If Yoshi-Sensei-Sama-Kun-Chan-Sama doesn't start the next Live Letter with a live beheading of the entire ""localization team"" and an apology, I will be very much upset.

The worldbuilding and designs of the first zones + music were top notch tho.But I'm honestly not a fan of what they did in the second half of the MSQ. I expected it to be nothing extraordinary, because it's the start of a new adventure, but despite that I found it very underwhelming, from the motivations of the villains to the writing of the story.Some moments are also really cringe-worthy, although I never had a problem with all the cheesy friendship moments in previous addons.Bringing the Scions back straight after Endwalker was completely unnecessary (Some- or all of them shoud have died in EW, their story was finished and it would have been a great end... OR make them disappear for more than 2 expansions before letting them show up again, to make it interesting, but no...), not enough happens with them. They were practically not needed and they could have just established new, fresh characters instead...And it's a shame that Ishikawa didn't write the story this time, you can clearly feel itOne of my biggest complaints... WHY are the devs still so afraid of changing the FF14 formular and trying something risky again ???Every addon is so calculated. It gets so mundane and boring still continuing the same formular (with only small changes) for all those years. Dawntrail could have been the addon to really change things up in terms of gameplay, new player accessibility, story presentation and overall gamedesign for quests and such... but noThey could have tried changing the Dungeons in some way again, instead of doing 3 bosses and 3 hallways every time. Make them smaller but larger in number? or change the way gear is destributed over the dungeons? Making them harder was great, but its hardly anything groundbreaking new...change up fates by making them harder and more complex. A lot of cutscenes should've been solo duties, but aren't. The lack of voice acted cutscenes is also really apparent.Make more smaller zones and 2 really big zones for example, or go back to older zones and expand on them, stop sticking to 6 zones in every expansion, experiment more. Every expansion is sooo predictable, and after all those years i want to see more change...-SPOILERS-WHY include the second Hub City in the Marketing this time?!?! [spoiler]It would have been a great twist not knowing that the game would change so much in the second half. The first zones and the trailer would have been enough to sell the game to me... I really didnt like where it was going in terms of design- and story/lore wise in the second half. Hated the NPC designs in solution 9. Aswell as the whole Phantasy Star Online and Tron like designs. I have nothing against sci-fi, i like the allagan look... but I don't like this style at all. At least not in an FF.The whole soul/memory transfer thematic is so overused in games and movies, same as timetravel plots. Im glad its over now, and i hope we never see this thematic again, PLEASE don't let it be a thing in the post DT MSQ... [/spoiler]I'm also not a fan of zones that can never be visited again from a story perspective. That just makes the world/tural seem very small and unconnected to me.

It starts boring and it ends annoying and boring. I also had to change the voice acting from English to German, not because I understand any German, but because I couldn't stand the sublevel of voice acting of Wuk Lamat. The voice actor shows the emotion level of a log, in other words, it was completely amateurish and bland. Most of the quests were of course meaningless fetch quests for the beast tribes, but this time it was much harder to tolerate them because the story didn't lead to anything interesting, and I knew at the end of each quest I would get basically nothing.The feeling of being a side character in the story didn't appeal to me, and I didn't even understand why the Scions were there because they also did basically nothing. They felt like that kid in a tree costume in the school plays. In summary, bad writing and character creation, bad dialogue and bad quests. This wouldn't have been so important but FFXIV is a story focused game, hence when the story is not good it affects the gameplay.

76561198081552414,0,0,english,"Dawntrail is a step above the previous expansions in terms of gameplay - encounter designs such as dungeon bosses and the trials are some of the best I've experienced in my relatively short 1 year of playing this game. Even the new job, Pictomancer, is an absolute blast to play and most certainly my favorite of the caster jobs.However, the same couldn't be said for the story of this expansion, which I can safely say is some of the absolute worst writing I've ever come across; mixed with a myriad of factors that makes for an utterly miserable MSQ experience.The sheer incompetence of the new lead writer and his utter inability to write a world beyond the depth of a puddle have severely hurt the story of the expansion. Piss-poor attempts at world-building, which this expansion heavily focuses on, is instead met with ""I've already seen this before, but done more interesting, and less tedious, preachy, hamfisted and doesn't take 10+ quests worth of padding and poor dialogue."" This results in a absolute slog in an experience where nothing important ever happens and you're forced to read through worthless lore bits that provides nothing of value to you as a player. While this problem was always apparent in the entirety of FFXIV, Dawntrail puts it on a whole other level.Now, to address the elephant in the room, the reason why the expansion stinks as hard as does, can be chalked down to the expansion' s focal character - Wuk Lamat, aka Furry Naruto. The only concrete thing I can tell you about this character is that she loves peace. and that the writer is utterly in love with her and NEEDS everyone to know it. Making a newly introduced character the main focus in a brand new adventure is by no means a bad thing, in fact it could even be a breathe of fresh air; watching the perspective of another while your player character plays the role of an observer / mentor is an idea worth exploring. The problem with Dawntrail and Wuk Lamat, however, is that the writer felt the need to shove her in your face for every single minute thing, no matter how insignificant, at the expense of every single other character. 90% of the game's dialogue involves her in some form, returning characters are robbed of all agenda, instead turning into mouthpieces to further sing praises to the beloved black hole of a character. Any of her perceived ""flaws"" are barely considered as such, and only used in comedic scenes, if not only to lead to NPCs reassuring her of how awesome she it. Wuk Lamat's presence in the story is the equivalent of a person standing [i]waaaaay[/i] too close to you while talking. Ironically enough, for how invasive she is in the story, the most enjoyable portions of the MSQ are when she's not around. [i]I've grown to love Wuk Lamat! Everyone she meets will come to love her too![/i] - Daichi Hiroi, lead writer of this mess.Antagonists that directly opposes the creator's pet behaves like an underage bully, akin to characters in a Dhar Mann video. Further exploration of the antagonists in an attempt to humanize them only serves to exacerbate my grievances with the way they write villains in this expansion. They have clear motivations, sympathetic backstories....which still doesn't explain why they are so over-the-top, cartoonishly evil in the first place. The most unforgivable thing that led me to write this review, the one event that led me to look upon this expansion with almost disdain, is [spoiler] the Final Trial. A rare moment in this mess of an MSQ where your player character is given any agency as a character instead of an over-glorified background prop. A very strong build-up to the showdown, followed by an extremely interesting and mechanically engaging final boss fight, coupled with fantastic music to accompany the experience. After a very dissatisfying experience with the story, I would love for something that could end the entire expansion on a high note....then in the final stretch of the fight, a cutscene plays and Wuk Lamat hijacks the fight once again, essentially stealing your thunder, and robbing you of what little you have as a character. I have genuinely no idea what the writer is thinking when he wrote this scene, is he that over-confident that people will love this character so much? To add further insult to injury, the remainder of the fight becomes a victory lapse, as Wuk Lamat is so powerful she starts levitating in the air and going full medieval on the boss, blatantly dealing far more DPS than your entire party combined while giving you a buff that explicitly states that you, the player character, is so inspired by this creator's pet that you break mortal limits. This is a level of pandering that puts even Empress Theresa to shame, and I am frankly amazed by the writer's gall to even entertain the idea that people will like this. This very moment turns what could've been a solid 10/10 fight for me into a 1/10, and never before have any game left such a pit in my stomach. Thought that you can ""skip the story, enjoy the game?"" Too bad, the Furry Naruto will hijack the boss fight as well. [/spoiler]My only hope for the future of this game's story is that the current lead writer [i]never[/i] writes anything ever again, and that the post-launch MSQ dial back on the blatant character favoritism and learn to give others a room to breathe.I'm glad to see that I'm just one of the many players who shares the same grievances with the writing. I hope to see things improve in future patches, and maybe, just maybe, will they finally give more screen time to characters who sorely needs them; like a certain lalafell who became a Pictomancer for this brand new adventure, only to become a background prop for all but a few quests in the MSQ.

I was ready for a low level story that would work as a holding pattern until they figured out where they were going in the future. In short I was prepared for filler, I knew it was coming. But I was expecting QUALITY filler, a light exploration focused expansion.But Dawntrails MSQ is horrible in almost every imaginable way. From the plot, to the characters, the pacing, the handling of established characters, and especially how your PC is treated.And to quote a wise old man talking about Star Wars. The worst part of Dawntrail is It's here forever it can never be undone. It will strangle FFXIV for whatever time left this game has. Every new person will have to slog through this pill of garbage MSQ even if the follow on expansion(s) are quality. And whats worse is what many others have said is true, things outside of the MSQ are almost all fairly high quality. The combat content is still solid as far as MMOs go, the visual overhaul is great, the music (what little new there is) is fantastic.The issue is that all of that is in service of a story that is so bad it poisons what ever enjoyment that can be found in those elements.",1721014519,13,0,negative

76561198826991685,0,0,english,"I'll just give a breakdown of the pros and cons...PROS- Great dungeons (I'm excited for the raids!).- Awesome graphics update.- The new zones are nice.- New dye system and gear work well (more will be implemented in the future).- Music is awesome. Some people don't like 'one' specific song, but I didn't particularly mind it. It's just not for everyone (also could have been 'when' it was played that threw a lot of people off).CONS (Minor spoilers)- Alright...so, the main issue is the story. A lot of people are defending it, saying that it has to start off slow like ARR...but ARR's story writing wasn't bad, it was just slow and that's fine.- There is a sincere lack of maturity in the writing and main confrontations. To be fair, I'm all for a positive, feel-good expansion, but the story-telling here left a lot to be desired.- Wuk Lamat's character had a lot of missed potential. Again, I don't mind the positivity at all, it's just the execution. - I don't mind stepping into a mentoring (or side character) role, but I wish I could have offered more mentoring opportunities and/or chances to help other characters grow (without just being hired muscle). - SO MUCH TELL, DON'T SHOW. The writers of this expansion just HAD to tell you 100x times what their message is, and force-feed it to you. AGAIN, I like these positive themes, but the BEST stories are written with a 'show', don't 'tell' method.SUMMARYI understand that some people are saying that the negative reviews are 'too harsh'. I have to disagree, because the collective stories wrapped up within FFXIV's universe are wonderful and loved by many. I can't, in good faith, give this a positive review when the most compelling part of this game is the story itself. This expansion deserves the mixed reviews (unfortunately), and I sincerely hope that whatever is going on in the writing team sorts itself out.TLDREstinien gets a cool vacation, and we get subscribed to Disney Plus for kids.",1721005446,16,1,negative

There isn't a single plot point that forces the WoL and by extension the player feel personally invested, we just stand in the background and nod as Wuk Lamat takes all the credit for the work we personally put in.Here is an example of quests:>Talk to Wuk Lamat>Follow Wuk Lamat>Help Wuk Lamat>Walk with Wuk Lamat>Ask about Wuk Lamat>Carry items for Wuk Lamat>Give your favorable opinion about Wuk Lamat>Cheer on Wuk Lamat>Do chores for Wuk Lamat>Die for Wuk Lamat.............it goes on!On another note: Wuk Lamat's english VA is terrible. Wuk Lamat sounds like a flamboyant man. It made me uncomfortable and pissed me off. She or he is the whole expansion and never shuts up. What about Koana?! FFS!! Give this guy more time to speak and build on his character........ The pacing is abysmal, predictable Disney level storytelling and at times cringe. I am convinced that EW was the ending to XIV.

Now this wasn't only found in Wuk but there was other moments with some of the other newer characters that also had moments of the acting being lacking in the emotion.Visuals (this is a positive)As for the visuals and level design, It was great and most likely the best thing they did this expansion. the zones felt mostly unique and vibrant except for one spot but that's BIG spoilers sorry.Combat, Dungeons, and Trials oh my- Combat changes, I can only speak for DRG and GNB at the moment. DRG is my main class and it took some time to get used to but the changes feel ok, not sure if I like them more than what they where though. as for GNB which is my main tank, I don't play tank as much but GNB didn't get much in changes but new abilities and they feel great- Dungeons this expansions are eh, Visual they're great except for the first one, wasn't a fan. They tried to make them more ""Stressful"" which I think they over did it. at least one of the bosses in the dungeons has awful mechanics. I wouldn't mind if it was in post expansion content or side content that's aimed for endgame but for Leveling dungeons it needs to be toned down a smidge.- Trials are great, they feel and look great so not much to say hereFinal thoughtsnot sure what happened but the writing for this expansion was a let down. I wasn't expecting Shadowbringers or Endwalker but it was forced at the end, I feel like they should have ended it at the death of a certain character and left the last half to build up in post content and then be the focus for the next expansion.

Most jobs received underwhelming and downright boring new abilities, while those that received reworks to some degree ended up significantly worse for it (astrologian and black mage in particular.) Many changes feel half-baked and untested, which has led to things like monk completely neglecting their entire toolkit except for 2 buttons. The jobs that do function received abilities that are, in a word, ""safe."" Most major cooldowns either turn into or grant a single big hit that effectively adds nothing of interest to the gameplay beyond ""big number fun.""The writing is poorly done from a technical sense, with us often being told details about characters that we never see in action. Events from the last quest are summarized immediately. Entire segments of the plot rely entirely on our party of seasoned adventurers and scholars behaving as complete and utter morons. None of the main cast of Scions are given any real character arc, and the character arcs for new characters that we do receive resolve far too quickly and anticlimactically. Too much time is spent on extremely shallow and one-note worldbuilding. We're supposed to appreciate the cultures of these different people within Tural, but are only really given a single point and a 1-paragraph summary of their history that is regurgitated again and again until it's time to move on.The excuse of it being a new story arc is often used to shield the game against these complaints, but being the start of a story does not excuse the lack of technical skill and care present in the writing.With all that said, there are some side characters and antagonists whom I do think were well-written and enjoyable, but they were overshadowed badly. The encounter design for both dungeons and trials has been fantastic. If you play to do the trials and raids, Dawntrail can be worth checking out. If you're only interested in the story, I would put this expansion on the ""wait and see"" shelf. If the story quality of the patches improves, it could be worthwhile, but for now, it's best to remember the story at its peak with the Endwalker launch story, and not the disaster of the 6.x patches and 7.0.",1720992370,7,0,negative

Well I didn't expect she recruited them directly out of elementary school. Otherwise I can't explain to myself how this story even got approved. I've read summer holiday stories of 7 year old children that had more depth and development.I can even sum it up with one paragraph: ""Little Wuk Lamat - the Saturday morning kids show character - goes on a round-trip, becomes mega-super-duper-awesome and fights the evil villains with the power of friendship and by completely ignoring logic, common sense and plotholes and after that everyone clapped. Somewhere along the lines we meet discount GaBu. Also there are other unimportant people there.""But it can't all be bad, can it? Well the game looks pretty and I really appreciate Stormblood now more. Yes SB was slow and had a few annoying characters, but it also gave us really amazing characters and the overall story was interesting.I've spend 6.000+ hours reading even the simplest side quest, random book, shell and console and I will most likely skip the rest of Dawntrail just so I can get to the shinies. I just can't take this awful story (if you even want to call it that) anymore. On the other hand maybe if I speak to Wuk Lamat the 50th time the Stockholm Syndrome will finally kick in.

I'm not opposed to this (simple, evil villains exist!) but we get very very little understanding of their motivations other than 'is a bad person' or the cliche 'is doing bad things for ""good"" reasons' but absolutely refuses any and all criticism about the plan and thus ultimately is just a bad person.I predicted every single bit of the story along the way, which, in my opinion, made it very hard for me to care about any of it. There were a few small moments that invoked emotion, but outside of that, compared to Endwalker at least, I just didn't feel immersed or connected to the story at all.And contrary to some of the other reviews, I actually found most of the duties dull and repetitive.

First half felt like tolerable preparations for things to come, but the final three zones are very poorly written. It seems like different writers took over different segments of the story, and HO BOY, it is rough in the major plot development department for level 95 onwards.Some people really hate the amount of screentime Wuk Lamat gets over all other characters, and that is valid. They must've written the story with the intention of recording the least amount of voicelines for the Scions, because every moment they appear, they're quickly hurried out of frame or do nothing in the current situation, despite clearly having the ability or motivations to. Even the WoL gets denied countless opportunities to jump in, just to move the plot forward how the writers wanted, or let Wuk Lamat be the main character. These were a handful of the ""mid or cringe"" bits, but not all of them. They cut as much Scion screentime as possible, and don't get why they had them come with us.The villains motivations are poorly written or nonexistent. Much of the developments that occur in the second half of MSQ are poorly written or unexplained. We're apparently just on a Wuk Lamat rollercoaster and no Scion has any screen time long enough to help her make intelligent decisions, instead of us just following around and watching shit unfold without us getting to do anything. It's a huge letdown after Endwalker. I knew it was going to have to take some risks to establish a new MSQ story arc, but those last 2-3 zones really just took the wind out of the sails.

It just has it all - untested gameplay changes that break classes and outright introduce critical bugs, stupid story that has 0 plot twists and focuses ONLY on one stupid stupid (not a typo) side-character that makes you do menial tasks during your ""vacation"". Sure locations look nice and all but they look nice in other expansions either...The other problem is the structure of the expansion - it's exactly the same as ALL previous ones. While it was fine if there was a compelling story it's really shows here. You want something like Dragonflight, you want End of Dragons, you want SOMETHING different. But no - you still get the same empty world with a few fates. Honestly the only real MMO aspect in ffxiv is clubbing and roelplay. That's it.

I pushed all the way through Stormblood, Shadowbringers and then Endwalker, and boy was it a bloody good ride. Heck, post Endwalker may have been one of the best mini expansions ever.Then suddenly I hit a big fluffy brick wall. I love Hrothgar and was excited to see female hroth added to the game and about a month and a half ago I hit 6.55 and damn. it just killed my hype for Dawntrail. I am still on the first quest of 6.55 as of this writing.I hear online that this fluffy brick is literally the center of pretty much the entire expansion. I dunno if I have it in me to suffer through 60+ hours of that honestly piss poor voice acting and equally piss poor writing. Ill get around to playing the expansion, I just don't know when. A lot of really good games are out right now and if FFXIV wants to bring the quality of its MSQ down a few notches (Game probably needs it, so I get it.) after endwalker, fine, but ill spend my gaming hours elsewhere for now until I hit a gaming drought and remember FFXIV is on my back burner.Please, please, please, just shelf this character once this expansion is over with and use this expansion as a spring board into greater expansions later. (Sorta how ARR was pretty meh but it laid the ground work leading into a series of great expansions.)Ill update this review later when I actually start digging into the actual content of the expansion. I just gotta swallow the brick first.P.S. This is personal opinion and I mean no shade to the VA or writers personally. I wish them all the best.

76561197993758454,0,0,english,"The GOOD:The graphics update: It's a huge plus. Much better lighting and texturing, but it's subtle enough to retain the game's style.Dungeons and Trials: The dungeons and trials are the best part of the expansion. They are more challenging than usual and have some fun new mechanics.Music: I almost put this in the MEH category since a lot of old music was recycled this expansion. And some music did not fit the situation. Considering this is supposed to be the beginning of a new arc, I would have thought they'd put more effort into new music. However, most of the new music is very good.The MEH:Voice Acting (English): Considering how much money this game has made and how important the story is to that success, it is inexcusable how little voice acting there is in the MSQ and how much of the voice acting is wasted on non-essential NPCs. The quality of the voice acting was inconsistent, both in sound quality and delivery. Wuk Lamat's VA did an ok job with what they had to work with.The BAD: (!SPOILERS AHEAD!)Expectations: If all you saw of Dawntrail before release was the cinematic trailer, then you will be confused and disappointed. The trailer makes it look like you are embarking on a new adventure and a new mystery with your pals from the Scions, with you taking a leading role as usual. Wuk Lamat isn't seen until the very end of the trailer and only for a few seconds. Wuk Lamat is the entire expansion. You do almost nothing without her and she is taking the lead in almost everything. The Scions are barely involved and even when they are they are wasted. To me, this was a huge let-down.The Story: TLDR: It's bad on many levels.If you like Shounen, you will love this. If you're tired of childish anime tropes, you will hate this. This might as well be called Dawntropes. Wuk Lamat is ignorant and immature despite being raised by a competent leader. She is Naruto from Wish. Everything just works out for her in the most contrived way possible and every tragedy she endures was avoidable if the writers weren't using anime logic for everything.Bakool JaJa is evil on the level of an old cartoon villain and their attempt to give him a redemption arc was so sloppy it was insulting. Any competent authority would have put him to death for the things he did.Zoraal Ja's character arc was more like a crazy straw. He wants to teach people the important of peace by going to war. Yet he expresses absolutely no love or interest or concern for anyone, to the point of murdering his most loyal supporter. He talks about the Garlean empire like they were a bunch of idiots for trying to rule the world with force alone yet that is all Zoraal Ja ever tries to use. He's a hypocrite and an idiot and no one calls him out on it. All attempts to paint him as a complex villain was terribly done.Sphene's entire objective makes no sense and one of your companions even points it out. But someone else interrupts before Sphene responds to them. She claims to need souls or life energy specifically to keep the memories of her people alive. We already know this is a lie because our companions were transferred (memory and soul) from the First back to the Source using a crystal with no need for additional power. On top of that, all physical and spiritual matter is made of up Aether in FFXIV. Including memories and souls. Life energy IS aether. And even if they needed a more specific element of aether, they have a technology called Electrope that converts electricity into other elements of aether. And even assuming her need for souls was true, she will inevitably run out when she wipes out all the other reflections. So her plan makes no sense no matter how you look at it. I get that she's more like an AI than a real person, but she was created by supposedly intelligent people who should have known better.What's the deal with missing parents and unexplained deaths? Wuk Lamat meets her real father, but no mention of her mother. Erenville has a mother but never even knew his father's name. Plus, his mother dies but not from old age, so what happened to her? Zoraal Ja is essentially a prince, but there's no mention of who his mother is. Zoraal Ja has a son, but once again, no mention of a mother. For both of these people it would be incredibly out of character for them to mate with someone who meant nothing to them. Krile's parents are dead, but probably not from old age so what happened to them? And what kind of parents hand off their baby to the first random people they meet? One of them being a huge and scary-looking two-headed lizard. And what were the odds of them opening the gate to the Source just when they happened to be in the room?I could go on and on about plot holes and bad character development, but you get the picture. The story feels badly paced and rushed. They could have easily stretched the Rites to cover the entire expansion and saved Sphene's part for the patch content. It would have given them a lot more time to develop their characters more naturally and given the different cultures of Tural more than lip service. It felt like ""diversity for diversity's sake"".CONCLUSION:If you skip all the dialogue and cutscenes and just focus on the actual gameplay, you'll probably have a good time. If you play FFXIV for the story, you might have a good time if you just turn your brain off. If you're like me and prefer to be treated as an audience with more than an elementary-school level of critical thinking, you're going to hate it.",1720875548,9,1,negative

She does not ruin this story though as others say. She heavily contributes to its low bar but isn't the sole reason. The other reasons are how shallow the plot is.

The pacing is egregious, the motivations for the antagonists are non-existent or borderline comical. I'm talking Sunday cartoon villain levels bad. The issue isn't that I went into this expansion with high expectations after the masterpieces that were Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Someone once said that, ""Final Fantasy XIV will always be about the WoL having adventures with your friends. So long as you have the Scions with you, things will always be interesting.""Unfortunately, these are not the Scions you remember. Never mind that half your crew are absent for the bulk of the expansion's story, but when they are there, they could just be generic NPCs pulled from the nearest village and you would be none-the-wiser. The best word to describe the writing is: Shallow. The protagonist of this expansion is a shallow character who could have been in a failed Shonen Jump manga, the antagonists are quite shallow, and the only character to have any depth appears way too late into the expansion to justify the 20-30 hours you spent getting there. Not to mention they feel like a copycat of a previously well-loved antagonist turned best friend. I've been playing FFXIV since Heavensward.

I've played WoW a lot in my life and FFXIV always excelled over WoW to me because it could produced a story I cared about (and the music is way better in FF too). Well this expac no longer does that. This story is all about one character that isn't your character her name is Wuk Lamat, and the MSQ writers shove this character in your face constantly.

How we got an expansion story this basic, and awful is beyond me. It is akin to putting your nose to a dog's behind and inhaling deeply. No, I was not expecting a high stakes story, this was supposed to be a fun vacation, but it is not, you will speak to Wuk Lamat 104 times in the MSQ as a quest step. Someone actually counted. No, I did not skip the cutscenes, but I wish I had.Yes, the cutscenes and quest design actually made me exit the game and go to bed multiple times because I was yawning the entire way through. Yes, the ENG voice actors that are US natives. (Wuk Lamat, several NPC's in the ' FF Texas' zone.) Are WAY below the standard of voice acting I would expect Square Enix to hire. Turns out voice actors from the States just absolutely SUCK and should not be used ever again if we can help it, lest we return to the horrors of ARR ENG dub. The cast that we got in HW are stage actors and severely outclass their US counterparts to the point I consider it insulting Wuk Lamat has 456% more voiced lines than any other NPC in the expansion. There is a distinct lack of Voice over work on critical parts of the story too, which also was wild to me considering how much useless stuff is actually voiced, like Wuk Lamat's 50th speech about peace and understanding cultures. (Its only ever about as deep as enjoying Tacos and food.)  And also obviously they are the main character for this expansion, which is terrible. The player character is useless, and called by other npc's as ""Wuk Lamat's friend' or even ENTOURAGE. They take credit for the things the WoL does. It is obvious, that this character is somebody's pet OC, they wanted to shove into the game and outshine the hero of the saga. And they do, to the point I felt entirely not needed. I was not required at all past level 94. The pacing of the story is awful, it is riddled with Deus ex Machina to save Wuk Lamat, and put them on a pedestal so they can preach at us about understanding and love. There is more to FFXIV than the MSQ though. The combat scenarios, dungeons and job changes are great. I applaud the environment and world design.Some of the music, especially the disney choir musical one was an absolute miss for me sadly. I love FFXIV but I loathe Dawntrail's Main Scenario, so I cannot recommend it to others. I have already got an FC to manage and sunk cost fallacy, I will remain, but wait until 8.0 and rush through this garbage fire of an MSQ if you are a single player type of player.",1720810096,30,2,negative
76561198026281285,64061,1290,english,"daisuke ono hard carry. story content is otherwise ok. gonna go on a whim here and say that any of the negative reviews that talk bad about the voice acting only played with EN voices and not JP.i will say that it's weird that this was basically marketed to us as a sort of holiday expansion story-wise and yet we get some of the same annoying filler chore quests that's been plaguing MSQ since ARR. writing could be better. music's alright. zones feel frustrating, but that feels morel like a byproduct of issues with aether currents and not anything to do with the fault of zone design. zones are otherwise okay.my biggest hang-up with this expac was with the battle content (and also the fact that we're kinda still sticking to the same formula for a lot of non-story related things, such as aether currents. while the way you get flight. aether currents could and should be a LOT better - and square still seems to be largely ignorant on this, and again we get the ""if you wanna fly, do chores"" mentality that has stuck since HW. it's not good).as an AST main, the dungeons were enjoyable and refreshingly challenging, however for how quick the mechanics go off, the tells are not... tell-ey enough. this is something of a major annoyance and just not something that works in an environment where you have a lot to keep track of at once, like again, as a healer, you have to mind the party's state (health, support buffs, is someone about to get hit by a mechanic in a way that is entirely preventable by you?, etc.), your own rotation (especially since AST's is the most complex out of all healers) AND avoid mechanics (in DT's case, the more obvious and slower ones). so you mean to tell me that i need to do all that AND be looking out for these very subtle tells so i can be on top of mechanics? in savage/ultimates, sure. that's where i expect it. not in normal/MSQ content. and on top of this, you cannot convince me that the final MSQ dungeon was playtested at all. were QA so preoccupied with making sure the graphics changes go out fine, that they neglected to take a look at how some of these fights went? i fail to understand how it passed muster, it's just too artificially difficult imo. i have similar gripes with the first trial, but the final MSQ dungeon makes the first trial look tame by comparison. there's also some similar, but more minor issues in that regard with the dungeon two dungeons before the final MSQ dungeon, but that's nitpicking. and interestingly, the final trial was perfectly fine. mechanics were great, the boss was fun and it was great to heal for. but i feel like DT was a very anti-healer expac, based on my experience in battle content.speaking of, my take on AST-specific changes. i went into DT thinking AST was dead and that i'd have to change main, but after experiencing it a little and toying around... eh. it has promise. ultimately - the worst thing square can do, is remove astrodyne, which they've done. the second best thing they can do, is bring back astrodyne.otherwise a good expansion, i enjoyed it a lot, but those grievances prevent me from giving a positive review.",1720801531,13,0,negative
76561198016742311,0,0,english,"FFXIV is an MMO, but before you get to play you have to go through the story. This review is about this (entirely single player if you chose to) experience. Not the endgame (that might for all we know be great). Not the dungeons (that are actually better than ever).3/10That is a very tough score to see, especially after the past heights. There are many issues that compound on each other causing the story to be a miserable experience for majority of it. Unfortunately this is the lowest FFXIV has gone. 1. StoryThis unfortunately is the main problem, that also exposes the other issues. If the writing was good all of the other issues would fade away. The story is split into 2 parts (with the second part being shorter, about 70/30 split). Let's split this into 2 parts as well:a. Part I 2/10[spoiler]The power of friendship and happiness triumphs over all and is the solution to everything.This trope, this bloody trope has been in so many teenage aimed anime and japanese games... for decades now. It's a trope that CAN be executed well, but because of its prevalence requires great execution, characters we care about and often subversion of the trope, at least partially. None of that takes place here.Wuk Lamat who is the main character is naive. Believes power of friendship can solve all problems.. This is obviously the case to facilitate character progression. That progression does happen, but in a such boring obvious and predictable way that its a chore to observe.Also it is straight up bad writing that Wuk Lamat ""loves her people and her country and their diverse cultures"" but knows NOTHING about them. She learns together with us. She lived her whole life here... How can she say she loves all of he cultures when she KNOWS NOTHNG ABOUT THEM?!?!The villains are also uninterestingBakool Ja Ja is straight up evil for no gain, then releases a flying weapon of mass destruction just to delay his opponents... does things that were specifically pointed out would get you disqualified (and does not get disqualified because the writers forgot I guess)... and then suddenly 180 turn, because his parents are shitty so its okay? No bro. Writers seem partially aware of this and remind us that it was not okay, but the characters all end up being okay with it almost immediately. I am sorry but this redemption arc was RUSHED.. RUSHED in a game that has you spend 2 hours do the most menial things... This is a 10 year old writing a redemption arc. Not once did they show Bakool being remorseless for his actions or hesitant when he was committing them, to hint that he could be redeemed. Also us solving the generations old problems in 5 minutes with ""just import different crops"".... I am sorry what. Galuf was here, a man of science. He would have solved this in 5 minutes too. Koana as well... What is this?!?!Zoral Ja: Guy wants to conquer the world, because he wants people to experience war so they would value peace. What.He is like that because everyone had high expectations of him.That's it.This is the same game where we had Emet-Selch. We also had Zenos, but he was entertaining eventually.. This one.... yeah.. just straight up boring.I feel I have been conned by the interviews - we did not get to hang out with the Scions on the beach sipping drinks and eating tacos. We also completely did not get to compete with the Scions who supported the other candidate. WHY. This was a great opportunity to make the story better without changing it dramatically. You showed us that Koana would probably be a better option in some aspects, why not have his team and him go all the way and compete with us fairly, but seriously. Why can't we come to blows (no killing of course)? Have interesting traps, have Urianger lie about something again. The theme of progressivism vs traditionalism is INTERESTING, RELATABLE.Oh and then we get a random cowboy zone that completely looks out of place. With what feels like filler for 2 hours. Okay. [/spoiler]b. Part II 6/10[spoiler]Shdowbringers rehash.Shadowbringers for me was the peak of FFXIV writing. I still cannot believe that the story team publicly said they ""kinda winged it"" with the story until then and pieces just kinda fell into place.. It felt like a master plan.So I do not blame the writing team for wanting to reach for that (after probably running out of ideas halfway).Let's see. Sphene is basically Emet Selch. Obsessed with protecting/restoring the people of the past, even at the cost of doing harm to people living in the present. Alexandria is from another reflection..... Living Memory evokes the same feeling as Amaurot.... a vision of the past....Some good emotional moments there, saying good byes to echoes of people that once lived, having to be the one pulling the plug - great. But also once again this is clearly not the same writing team as the original - Erenvile's mom just kinda died offscreen. We never learn how. Maybe the writers forgot that her race is very long lived, and she didn't look old at all....Sphene was a solid villain - I really like the fact that she did not have a change of heart last minute. After all she was just an AI, she rightfully so cannot overcome her programming. It was clear despite her programming it was a struggle for her to do what she had to do.Zoral Ja - 30 years have passed for him. Nothing changed. Snooze.Shout out to Wuk Lamat interrupting the final fight (and with that absolutely horrible voice acting in that moment... HOW DID THIS TAKE MAKE IT TO THE GAME? What was the voice director doing?!)[/spoiler]2. Voice Acting [ENGLISH] 4/10Wuk Lamat has vast majority of the voice dialogue so we will focus there: She does really good job in most of the chill/mundane dialogue parts, and the happy parts were straight up great. You can really hear the enthusiasm that matches the personality.Things fall apart in the negative emotional scenes, sadness is very mediocre. But where things get bad is any kind of action. I don't know if it's the fault of the voice actress or the voice direction but it is just... awful.. And unfortunately those are VERY important parts of the story, even if 80% of the spoken dialogue has great voice acting, it falls apart in those crucial moments.All the other characters barely have any voice lines (except [spoiler]Sphene[/spoiler] who did good)... Y'shtola's voice sounds weird, like it was recorded in a completely different location than the rest. The existing cast continues with their good performance, no outstanding moments, but no stinkers either.Big shout out to the voice actor of Graha'Tia who despite great success since he first voiced the character (he is in Bridgerton , literally a mainstream actor) continues to come back to the role. He also does the best job here (with limited material that he has). Massive respect.A lot of cutscenes that should have been voiced, were not... but there were also some cutscenes that did not need voice acting at all ended up having it? Was the budget cut in the middle of the production? Not sure who is at fault here but even if budget for VA was limited it could have been used in a better way.3. Music and Graphics 6/10 and 7/10Few tracks stick out (field battle theme), rest is alright but not memorable. Graphic update is noticeable and welcome.There is also a jarring vocal track playing during certain happy/victorious moments that sounds like something straight out of Lion King... It was so awful.4. Gameplay 3/10Severe lack of gameplay. Very few ""solo instanced"" epic moments. Too many things happen in cutscenes instead of those.It takes 5-6 hours BEFORE YOU GET TO FIGHT ANYTHING. Don't get me wrong - This has been the case in the previous expansions too, but the engaging writing makes those hours fly by.If we looked only at the quality of the gameplay the score would be higher, but I feel like the insane lack of quantity of it has to be given weight.",1720797042,156,2,negative

When I  was playing ARR I was thinking “I want to know how it ends”, in Dawntrail I was thinking “I want it to end”.My first major problem with Dawntrail is how bad the story is. After Shadowbringers and Endwalker the difference in quality of the story is extreme. The amount of filler and slow pacing was always a problem in FFXIV but in Dawntrail most of the story feels like a filler.My second major problem that I have with Dawntrail is the fact that we as the Warrior of Light are no longer the main character, we are not even a secondary character but a background character that sometimes is mentioned and referred to as just an adventurer. After saving the world(s) multiple times, after SAVING THE UNIVERSE now apparently it is irrelevant like it's World of Warcraft when nothing you did in the story ever matters.My third major problem with Dawntrail is the actual main character Wuk Lamat. Innitialy I thought that she was as annoying as Lyse in Stormblood, but I was very wrong. She is much, much more annoying, cringe  worthy, even more incompetent and her voice acting is on the level of ARR. Unlike Lyse who has main character syndrome, Wuk Lamat IS the main character and you will be forced to follow her for almost the whole expansion.

Die erste Hälfte fand ich noch ganz gut, mit dem Wettkampf und dem Thron. Ich mochte Lamati/Wuk Lamat sehr gern und ihr persönliches Wachstum. Jedoch ging es nach der zweiten Hälfte immer mehr bergab und noch weiter bis unter den Meeresspiegel. Man könnte meinen, ab der zweiten Hälfte haben sich die Autoren einfach an verschiedenen Quellen bedient, weil sie keine Ahnung mehr hatten, was man noch machen könnte. Gut, die vorige Geschichte ist zu Ende und die war groß und wurde immer weiter aufgebaut. Ich habe dadurch erwartet, dass die Story nicht so großartig sein wird wie im Vorgänger. Jedoch war die zweite Hälfte einfach nicht gut bis sehr schlecht. Wenn man aufpasst, kann man die Vorlagen der Story-Ideen schnell erkennen, an welchen Ideen sich anscheinend bedient wurde. Um ein paar Beispiele zu nennen, an die ich mich erinnert gefühlt habe: Terminator, Cyberpunk, Stargate SG1 S07E05: Die Macht des Speichers...OK, das ist ja nicht mal schlimm, wenn man sich aus anderen Quellen bedient und es logisch in ein Spiel einbringt. Jedoch, was mich am meisten aufgeregt hat, waren die Gründe des/der Bösewichts/Bösewichte! Es kann doch nicht sein, dass die Autoren nichts Besseres schreiben konnten, als dass der eine einfach einen Vaterkomplex hat und alles auslöschen will, weil Papi ihm in seinen Augen nicht genug Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt hat und aus Trotz Papis ""Spielzeug"" zerstören will!? Und dann eine kleine Prinzessin, die alles töten will, damit sie weiter mit ihren ""Püppchen"" spielen kann, oder anders gesagt, weiter VR spielen kann. Oh man... Oh man... das ist sooooo schlecht, da hatten die Gegner vom Originalspiel bessere Gründe als die in DT. Alles in allem ist die Story bis zur Hälfte ok, aber dann der Absturz.So, das zur Story, alles andere ist mega:    - Die Gebiete sehen mega aus    - Die neuen Klassen spielen sich super    - Wieder reichlich zu tun, jedoch bis jetzt nichts Neues, was man aus den Vorgängern schon kennt (ist aber meist so, die guten Sachen kommen mit der Zeit)    - Das Grafik-Update ist OK    - Die neuen Innis und Prüfungen sind wieder sehr nice gemachtAlles in allem würde ich dem Spiel einen Daumen zur Seite geben, jedoch geht das nicht, deswegen ein Daumen runter.",1720757302,3,1,negative

This is a bad expansion, I don't care if the instanced content is good or about the music that I actually really enjoyed, the core experience of the whole game, the MSQ, is awful and there is no other way to say it. By the way, did you know the phrase ""Return to Wuk Lamat"" (or a similar phrase) was the quest objective 139 times? In 100 quests, this phrase was used 139 times. That's 3x the second place, that goes to Lyse in Stormblood.R e t u r n  T o  W u k  L a m a tIf there was a Neutral option on Steam for the review, this one would 100% be it.This expansion's MSQ is really lackluster and predictable, here is the resume:-> Speak with Wuk Lamat-> Speak with 3 NPCs for whatever reasonWuk Lamat: ""Now I understand X people! Maybe that's why Papa wanted us to do this!!""-> Return to Wuk Lamat-> Voiced cutscene that is 10 seconds long-> Speak with Wuk Lamat (again, in the exact same spot)-> Unvoiced cutscene that is 2 minutes long and could easily be a continuation of the previous voiced cutscene, since it's the exact same conversation, but for some reason it's not.If you like this game's combat, the dugeons and trials are alright, fun enough I guess. The classes I've leveled to 100 are meh at best, mostly unchanged classes or ""X skill has an extra charge"". Viper had such an amazing potential, but they tried a ""combo"" system that can interchange with one another, sound cool right? Well, it's not, you basically just press the button that glows and that's that, since it's only 2 buttons that change when pressed (you read it right, Viper combo is only 2 buttons effectively). Don't try to learn the class by reading the tooltips, they are a huge wall of texts with tons of passives/skills names that you have to search which one is it by yourself. Monk has a interchangeable combo system that is fun and actually works. Now, Pictomancer (haven't leveled it yet) looks really fun, skill are beautiful and it has a new Canvas system that is refreshing, tinkered with it a bit and it feels pretty solid.I wasn't expecting something amazing, it's a whole new story with new characters after all , but this is bad. The most hyped moment was an Endwalker throwback, with Endwalker music and characters (won't say much because spoilers), but when the coolest moment of the story is basically from a previous expansion, it makes you miss what you had, not be hyped up for the new thing.",1720752713,11,0,negative

76561198025222306,0,0,english,"I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 continuously since 2016, and this is by far the worst expansion release I have witnessed. I am incredibly disappointed not only by what this game has become, but how out-of-touch the developers seem to be with the actual players.This review is focused only on the main scenario of Dawntrail. The combat content has not yet all been released, but I'm hoping that it lives up to the quality of what came in prior expansions. If the combat content is still fun in this expansion, then it is likely that Dawntrail as a whole may still be a worthwhile experience. However, that does not mean I can turn a blind eye to the abysmal visual novel experience that Square Enix is forcing its players to endure.Dawntrail itself narratively sits in an awkward position, because it exists in a space where it needs to fulfill two different objectives. On the one hand, this is a story that is only accessible after hundreds of hours of prior investment. To see Dawntrail, you have to have seen the *entirety* of five separate games' stories. On the other hand, this is a brand-new story that the developers have set out to tell. Most if not all of the plot threads relating to the previous expansions have been wrapped up, and any story worth telling will have to introduce new conflicts and characters. Unfortunately, this expansion failed to deliver what these objectives demanded. The story is not worthwhile enough to justify hundreds of hours of lead-up, and the new conflicts and characters feel empty and shallow.It is difficult for me to characterize exactly what went wrong in Dawntrail's story, but my succinct verdict is: the writing is bad. Very often, critics will make mention of ""telling instead of showing,"" but I think Dawntrail goes even further off the cliff. The writers will tell once, tell again, show a brief example, then make sure they tell once more with additional technical details and any other curiosities included. The pacing is so awful, I was sorely tempted to skip cutscenes in this game for the first time in 8 years. Awkward dialogue, stilted exposition, lack of characterization... too many things went wrong for me to point at one specific part and say ""this right here is the problem."" With a notable exception of Wuk Lamat.Wuk Lamat is the de facto protagonist of this story, and she is an insufferable character. She is introduced as having some character flaws: she rashly rushes into fights and is generally clueless of the culture of her people. At no point, however, are these character flaws resolved. Everything just magically works out for her, in true Mary Sue style. No real conflicts are borne of these flaws, and no conflict forces her to confront her weaknesses. It is generally not a problem that the player character, the Warrior of Light, is no longer the protagonist or even the main focus of the story. However, when the main character that we have to follow around is boring, it starts to grind on you quite a bit.It's very obvious as well, from the way the story is written, that whoever created Wuk Lamat was convinced that players would love her. All the dialogue is written with the assumption that we are on Wuk Lamat's team, we like her, we want her to succeed. At no point did the story ever give me any reason to feel these things - it was just assumed that we are totally on board with what is going on, and we have to let it happen.But I am not on board with this expansion. Not with the story, not with Wuk Lamat or any other characters, not with the formulaic structure of the story that Square Enix seems so frightened to let go of (1 dungeon every odd level, a trial at level 93, a trial at level 99, a certain number of quests and cutscenes in between each of these things, etc...). To call the story of Dawntrail a ""major disappointment"" would be letting the developers off the hook too easily, I think.I only hope that the raid series turn out to be better than this initial launch.",1720715459,8,0,negative
76561198167083081,375073,28,english,"**Spoiler free**I've been playing this game rather regularly since 2017 (as backed up by my 6200 hours played), and this is the first time I have been this disappointed in a piece of content released for this game.I have to echo the main concern people are having with this expansion: the story. Look, I get it. This isn't a story exploring nihilism and saving existence as it is like Endwalker. It won't be something that grand and intense. My expectations for some FF14-style intense adventure was LOW. That said.. the story was extremely boring. For the same company that reworked a HUGE chunk of their game recently (the ARR expansion) to CUT DOWN boring and monotonous story points and MSQ quests to then go and create again one of the most boring and monotonous MSQ stories is beyond me. ""FF14 players' brains can't process world building""""FF14 players don't like reading story text""""FF14 players can't stand not being the center of attention in the story""The classic ""gotcha"" arguments against any criticism for this expansion content is pretty wild to me. Avoiding spoilers as best I can, the first half of the story (the expansion is literally cut in half) is supposed to help world build with a mid-story 'climax' or payoff that feels so dull. I was hoping that the world building would become a tool for us ... something that would be important to later expansions or push us into the second half of the expansion. That didn't really happen.. you spend 4 hours bartering with a person wearing a duck mask and it doesn't provide anything meaningful besides the power of friendship during that mid-story 'climax'. And I can't really think of how we would move forward with some of the very few characters introduced to us. I thought we'd be forming a sort of new team of adventurers.The next half of the expansion is where I (and most people) are more positive. Ignoring the fact that your friends are just randomly with you providing absolutely zero utility and have no reason to be there, the second half gives you mystery and ties in parts from the previous expansions, exploring a current 'plot hole'/looming adventure to be had, and sets up for what could come in the next expansion(s). Great! Love that! It could have been much better if it was more like 75% of the story rather than 40-50%. It felt rushed, squeezed together, and yet still fluffed with boring dialogue. If it had more time to be expanded on, DT truly would have been miles better than what it was.Now while this is all subjective, I know my opinions on the battle content is a bit controversial as some people find that to be the expansions only saving grace. I really didn't like most of it. The trials were so anticlimactic to me (besides the last one), and partly because I think one of the antagonists was really terribly written (trial 2) and they did not make anybody care about them. But I thought the mechanics were boring and recycled, half the time just adding a flood of visuals that made it difficult not because of the mechanics them-self, but because you can barely tell what is going on on the screen with all the visual bloat. I also find the expert dungeons to be TERRIBLE, everybody dreads going to expert roulette and 8 times out of 10 I just get a group who talks about how much they dislike the dungeons. I miss the fun bunny dungeon and cyber alien dungeon with banger music we got in EW :(A couple of the MSQ dungeons were bland BUT I did like them for the most part. Pictomancer is maybe one of my favorite jobs they've every created, it is extremely fun and unique.Moving on from my issues with the battle content (and boring job adjustments), my main point was the MSQ, and it really does not live up to the quality we usually get from SE and FFXIV. Do I think this was lazily made and no thought or care was put into it? Absolutely not. Do I think they made really poor choices and that the risks they took ended up not working at all? Yes, I do. SE tends to take feedback very seriously and I just pray to the gods that they make changes for the next expansion. I know this was an awkward one to make - kind of a reset in the story after a 10 year story arc. But I had more faith in their abilities. Maybe they are just better at making climactic and grand stories than they are with world building? I do think the patches will improve my feelings on the expansion as whole, as they seem to have some really great content planned.Get them next time Yoshi P!

But that does not excuse the sorry state the game is in.We have veterans praising heavensward as the best expansion ever because even though it was rough around the edges with the fight design being extremely overtuned for the majority of it, tons of systems that either didn't make sense or had no place to be there (ACCURACY STAT LMAO), it was charming, it was incredibly charming and fun to go through all that jank because the sky was the limit in regards to fight and job design.Jobs were difficult but they all had a very strong identity.

Unfortunately for this expansion the story and new characters for this are the weakest point by far. While previous expansion were like great novels, building on previous lore like say LOTR, Harry Potter or GoT, this was more like picking up a random book by a unknown writer discarded in the same section by mistake. While it's not awful, it's certainly no where on par with previous expansions, doesn't use or add much to the world build and introduces some clearly terribly written characters who take up the bulk of the screen time.If you love the game mechanics of FF14, the challenges in gameplay or the variety of crafting/glam then this expands on those pretty well.

76561198005331102,0,0,english,"The main selling point of the game, the story, is unfortunately poor quality this time around. In  many ways it feels like the writing has regressed down to what it was in A Realm Reborn days, in addition of introducing entirely new glaring problems. A character who might be otherwise forgivably mediocre or mildly annoying for a side role, with little development, is given center stage for the entire expansion, not only eclipsing the player character but all others as well, when their lacking substance never warranted it. The number of times you have real gameplay or activity denied from you to  be instead forced to watch a visual novel from the sidelines is staggering. This is not just an issue of ""who gets to be the main character"", but the fact the player character (along with every other character except the writer's favorite) is denied any agency at all and is reduced to a prop for most of the story. It's especially painful after seeing the previous expansions pioneer so many tricks to make our silent protagonist appear more active in the narrative, this expertise now apparently forgotten. The dungeon boss designs have markedly improved from Endwalker, but unfortunately the design of the classes/jobs overall has stagnated at best, even several previous golden boys of the game such as Dragoon and Black Mage now either losing their identity or having their flexibility and skill expression removed in favor of frustratingly rigid gameplay. Meanwhile entire roles such as healers and tanks play so similarly to each other you might as well not have multiple jobs within them, except for an aesthetic choice. The new job, Viper, however is a breath of fresh air (and apparently Pictomancer as well, though I can't vouch for it personally yet). The overworld zones are beautiful, and form a far more cohesive corner of the world than in the previous couple expansions, aided strongly by the strong American (mostly southern) theme of the expansion. Unfortunately, the actual people living in these zones tend to be shallow and caricaturish representations of different cultures. Music is still stellar, though there are some notably misused tracks (overbearing BGM, jarring references to motifs from older games, a rather odd choice for the ending theme, etc.).If you are a new player considering starting the game, you'll still likely enjoy the previous expansions that of course come with Dawntrail, which are well worth your time despite the slightly rotten cherry on top. For players considering returning, I would recommend keeping considering.

76561198120552254,0,0,english,"ANOTHER EPISODE OF I WISH STEAM GAVE US A MAYBE OPTION FOR THE LOVE OF GODI am going to start off saying I enjoy Dawntrail, but as an expac it has some MAJOR caveats to it. It is very experimental in how it's handling itself, both in terms of progression and story.The dungeons and trials are some of the best in the game's history, truly top tier work. The gear options for glamour are also some of the best I've seen from a variety standpoint.However I feel the expac is filled with filler cutscenes where a quest has a fade to black and changes to a scene where everyone does 1 or 2 emotes, makes an angry/sad/happy/etc. face at each other, and scenes are randomly voiced for no reason and major scenes that should have voice seem to not have it. This is artificially stretching out an expac that should be 12 to 14 hours long to be almost the same length as end walker, there are that many cutscenes. You will see ""Talking to BLANK will cause several custscenes to play in sequence. Please set aside ample time to view them."" A warning that for all other expacs was only seen right before major story moments, or huge story climaxes, yet here it's like every 6 quests it pops up.My biggest complaint is a lot of cutscenes should've been solo duties, but aren't. Without getting into spoilers, such instances that come to mind for those that play are when the group is in pursuit of a certain individual during the first half of the expac, or things that take place ontop of something during the 2nd half, or an area that should've been a solo instance during a certain point in the story but isn't, ruining the feeling they're going for because every city has someone running around in a joke costume, killing the immersion. Overall I am enjoying my time with Dawntrail, it's a fun relief from the story heavy moments of the last two expansions, but it's def an expac you feel like you have to force yourself to trudge through at times.",1720650775,6,0,negative
76561197991833571,365335,271,english,"TLDR: Content good, story badThe new zones, dungeons, trials, two new classes and duties are all very enjoyable. But what really divides people is the story, some say the lvl 90-95 portion is very boring, some say the lvl 95-100 drops the ball. I'm in the former, while I started to enjoy it more later on it was still a very unremarkable story. The main problem is the writers exchange your established companions to refocus onto two, in my opinion, unlikeable ones - Wuk Lamat and Erenville. While Erenville was present as a decent side character in Endwalker, he's been turned into an insufferable main character here. Wuk Lamat - a boring, tiring new character whos entire personality boils down to naive goody goody heir to the throne, where the game forces you to be her cheerleader throughout, even so far as to force you into dialogue options as if you are best buddies. It's not earnt at all. Not to mention the English VA is not the greatest performance when compared to the others. The only slim saving grace is we get to know about Krile more.The other issue I found is from levels 90-95, there is no actual antagonist. You're stuck trying to win the ""Rite of Succession"" for Wuk Lamat, which involves going around learning about the different sub-cultures of the new land. While great for world building, it is a chore and a bore for people waiting for something to happen.

They instead push some insufferable loser that clings onto your character with such compelling qualities like getting seasick and fearing alpacas. The English voice acting is the worst it has ever been since ARR. This new character is pushed so hard onto the player and she is just the absolute worst. Completely entitled woman-child that thinks she should be queen because she is nice.In early expansions you had main characters in expansions that had diverse opinions and mature feelings. You had different people with interesting and compelling reasons for making the choices that they make. In this expansion? You have childish, high school level drama like an antagonist stepping on tacos and that is a plot point. There were light-hearted characters in the past, but never has the main character of an expansion been so unlikable and still get so much screen time. Lyse is a step up from Wuk Lamat and Lyse is a low bar to clear.They also ruined Black Mage with this expansion. They removed Ice Paradox, they removed gaining MP while in Ice phase because a dev get their feelings hurt that players weren't being controlled to play exactly how these fragile devs demand people to play.

Wuk Lamat was a fun character, until she wasn't. Way, way too much of her. Erenville was at least left with some screen time, but poor Krile was completely shafted (and I thought her stuff turned out to be the most interesting).What? Oh, there were other party members too? Could have fooled me. As an example: the great diplomat and politician. Smartypants. Child prodigy. Blue Alphinaud has absolutely no advice for Wuk. Wuk IS who blue Alphinaud was in ARR, and yet he has not a single word of caution or anything (yes there is one mumbled line about naivety, but which he does not share with her).

There's dungeon bosses where I always see at least one DPS constantly dead, despite just being topped off and shielded, and the tank with like 4 vulnerability stacks.Speaking of which, I still dislike how the healer is essentially punished for the other players' mess ups. You already need to heal the damage they took and extra shield them, is the vulnerability stack really needed? Couldn't there be a way to punish the player who's actually failing the mechanic?

But in Dawntrail, they even removed the buff and the debuff that monk needed keep up at all times and replaced it with a combat system where the next attack you need to use lights up bright yellow, no thinking required. ""But they gave us a new useless button to press once every minute so it's okay"". No it's not. The job plays itself now, how is that fun. Why did they change it you may ask. Because some people who don't play the job and are not interested in learning it complained that it was too difficult. Now nobody enjoys playing it. same thing with kaiten, people complained, it got removed now nobody wants to play samurai, same thing. these toxic casual players always gotta ruin the fun. In many interviews prior to the release of Dawntrail the producer said that the diffculty of normal mode dungeons will be increased. It is true but not by that much, once you have played them and understand how it works, it's just as easy as in the previous expansion. especially since we now have very overpowered defence skills on the tanks. So the gameplay is just the same shit again, i am disappointed but not surprised. So what content is available to play in the game right now, 3 level 100 dungeons and two extreme fights. there is almost no content in the game to play right now, so that kinda sucks too, but that's nothing new. they delay the release of most of it to keep people subscribed for a long time, how nice of them.I could write more about this game but i just don't care. I don't think i will play this game ever again. Dawntrail was the last chance i was willing to give to this game, i was hoping that this time it would maybe be diffrent but unfortunately not. But back when this game was good it was very fun, i will not forget the memories i have from playing the game at that time and that is big reason for why i no longer enjoy how the game is today, and why i write this shit, because the game was so much better before. Before Endwalker that is. If the game is not fun then why bother.Dawntrail has been quite possibly the worst video game expansion i have ever played and even if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series you will probably not find much, if any enjoyment in this game.",1720626971,16,2,negative

While previous expansions have taken us on an emotional rollercoaster, the only emotions I felt here were boredom and annoyance. I don't mind our WoL taking a step back and acting more as a mentor or simple adventurer, instead of being the main focus. It's an interesting concept that you can do a lot with. However, the way it was handled in Dawntrail was utterly unenjoyable. Even if the PC is not intended to be the main focus, you have to keep in mind that this is still a game, and you need to give the player something to do. Just having us standing around, or doing only fetch quests, while another character gets to do all the interesting things, simply does not work. That, coupled with the insane amount of unvoiced cutscenes this time around, turns the expansion into more of a visual novel than a game. And not a very good one. I'm a big fan of world building, but the tell-don't-show approach they used here is really the worst way to do it.Personally I found the story completely uninspired, and our reason for being there nonsensical.[spoiler] The second part of the MSQ felt like a budget version of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, without any understanding of what made those expansions such outstanding experiences.[/spoiler] The biggest problem the MSQ has is the new main character, Wuk Lamat. While I was quite neutral towards her when she was introduced in the last patch, and also at the beginning of the MSQ, I quickly started disliking her as the story progressed. Her naiveté, the repeated jokes about her sea sickness, the constant ""happiness and peace"", the lack of any believable character development for her, coupled with very poor voice acting just make her into an insufferable character. Her complete cluelessness about her own country and people made her taking part in the rite of succession feel like a bad joke. There's ""unqualified to be a ruler"", and then there's whatever this is. The fact everyone's constantly cheering her on and no one every challenges her motivation, values or believes in any way, does not help either.[spoiler]I think I would have been fine with her character had they limited her presence to the first half of the MSQ. However, things only got worse in the second half, and she started hogging even more screen time. Even when there were important story developements that concerend other charcters in the group - instead of focusing on those characters, namely Erenville and Krile, the focus switched right back to Wuk Lamat, and completely ignored how the other characters were personally impacted by what just happened.[/spoiler] Generally, she is like a black hole, that attaches itself to everything, and sucks up any enjoyment, fun and character development.

I will say though, the voice acting from the new characters is this expansion's saving grace (yes, even Wuk Lamat's voice actress did pretty great given what she had to work with).I had mixed feelings with the music choices. Previous expansions had absolute bangers, but half of the new ones feel really out of place and completely goofy at times (one track reminded me of Toy Story, you can't unhear it). I can forgive the over-world/town tracks, but there are certain cut-scenes that had these motivational songs that warped me back to those corny Lifetime shows, and cursed Disney direct-to-video sequels that made me feel second-hand embarrassment. I don't know what possessed them to go with it, but maybe they wanted a Hercules moment. I was NOT impressed. If you're a healer and hoped this would be the expansion to change up your 1 button mashing idle clicker gameplay, then you're out of luck buddy. We're still one-button dps bots during down times since we got even MORE ridiculous ways to heal, while giving tanks another way to self-heal. Goodie.

I personally decided to main both of these jobs. Pictomancer particularly feels really satisfying when you're able to line up your big damage number abilities and skills properly. Viper is a level above Gunbreakers and Reapers in terms of busy gameplay, so they feel lightning fast if you like that combat style. Both of them are also pretty fun in PVP.

And my review is gonna be mostly focused on the story, since that's what I like the most and like most everyone says in their reviews, the combat and new graphics do indeed feel and look great so no complaints there.  For reference, I love XIV's story. I think the Hydaelyn/Zodiark saga, particularly when it became center stage at the start of Shadowbringers and finished in Endwalker, was one of the best stories ever told in gaming. Not just in XIV or the FF series as a whole. But gaming overall. Yes it had flaws, yes it also had filler quests but the good far far faaar outweighed the bad imo. Shadowbringers specifically in the finale of 5.0, and 5.3 gave us some of the best moments the FF series has ever had. And Endwalker had some of the most satisfying character moments, along with the 6.0 finale being the best wrap up to a 10 year saga the writers could have possibly given us. Again, they weren't perfect. But they were extremely extremely good.  In comparison, Dawntrail is a mess of a fucking meandering adventure. The story is stapled together by what feels very much like side quests pretending to be main quests, with little beats of just *ok* character moments sprinkled in to keep you on copium long enough to be disappointed by another chain of quests that feel like nothing else but filler. Every single zone in the expansion has got a handful of narrative problems everywhere and they just compound on each other so much over the course of the story that it's kind of become shocking to me that they thought THIS was a good enough followup to their last arc, and a decent start for their next.  Dawntrails story isn't bad per say. It could have been worse. But considering that XIV is known largely for its story, a story that has been praised to high heaven by us fans and critics alike, and that its advertised as a *story driven mmorpg*, it is a huuuge disappointment for us fans who know this team can do much better. It's like going to your favorite 5 star restaurant, ordering a brand new dish that they have, naturally expecting another 5 star meal or at least 4 stars, and being given a crusty two star meal that's somewhat cold, with some moldy ass looking bread on the side. This is not a good start to their next 10 year arc. We went from having some of the strongest stories in games to just being given a big ollle giant pile of *meh*. Wuk Lamat is a decent character but its kind of goofy to me that they went so hard on her that basically if you end up not liking her, which there is a good chance you wont because of how cliche she can be, then the entire expansion is gonna fall flat on its face. And I just do not understand why the writers put soooo many of their eggs in this one basket, which is the Wuk Lamat basket. Especially considering she is a character that we JUST met in 6.55, which was a half patch. She wasn't even given a full patch to be introduced before not only us, but the rest of the cast that we've come to love over the years were shoved to the side for her. So she can go on this padded adventure, and learn basic gradeschool life lessons like ""its ok to share your emotions with others"" and ""power of friendship!"" which is stuff that XIV has already given us in the past expansions that didn't feel nearly as hammered in. There's plenty of other story things besides how they handle Wuk Lamat that freakin disappoint me but this review would be twice as long if I went into them. But all in all, this is just...not it. Yoshi P and his team gave us gold in their past expansions with the sole exclusion being Stormblood, but even Stormblood was at least more consistent and less padded than Dawntrail as far as I remember. I'm gonna hold out hope that Yoshi and team pivot their writing plans in the 7.X patches based off of how mixed this story is and recover from it but as of right now, in 7.0. This is a pretty giant disappointment. The story has done something that I haven't really felt since the ARR patches, which is bore the heck out of me.

Infelizmente este não foi o único, até os personagens principais não form bem desenvolvidos, faltou tempo de tela para alguns enquanto outros tiveram muito tempo sem que isso trouxesse alguma evolução para o personagem.- Acontecimentos que não fazem sentido: Têm coisas que acontecem que não fazem sentido nem no mundo real e menos ainda no mundo do jogo, coisas do tipo: ""em vez de resolver um grande problema que poderia matar milhões de pessoas, vamos antes bater um papo e conhecer melhor as pessoas aqui""A premissa da história em si não é ruim e de fato abre margem para novas histórias, mas ela foi muito mal contada, em alguns momentos parece que estou seguindo uma side quest grande e não uma MSQ.Vi muita gente defendendo que a história é mais fraca pois a história principal já acabou e que já tinha sido falado que ela teria ""menos emoção"" já no anuncio da expansão, mas ter uma história de proporções menores e mais pé no chão não é justificativa para ter uma história mal contada.Agora, tirando a história, todo o resto que vi até agora só tenho elogios, o update gráfico está lindo, as dungeons e trials estão excelentes, as novas jobs eu ainda não joguei mas todos os meus amigos elogiaram muito, os mapas estão impecáveis, principalmente o último.Então assim, a expansão não está perdida, a história ainda pode ficar boa nas quests pós MSQ, mas isso só vai acontecer se as pessoas apontarem os problemas, se todo mundo ficar passando pano, a tendencia é só ir ladeira abaixo, eu reclamo aqui pois quero o melhor para o jogo e não porque eu o odeio.",1720531378,17,1,negative

76561198194747050,0,0,english,"I have never been bored during MSQ before and I have been playing this game consistently for almost 9 years now, with more than 10k hours in. Shadowbringers and Endwalker have been absolute masterpieces of storytelling that made FFXIV stand out from other MMOs because of its story. I personally started playing at the launch of Heavensward which I adored, and I enjoyed Stormblood, and at this point I refuse to lower my standards and just swallow the pill: ""it's supposed to be like this, it's a new start"". People seem to forget that good storytelling does not mean sad and depressing. It can be fun, it can be relaxing and can be happy and moving and of course it can be slow. It just has to be GOOD! The WoL has been too much in the background this time around, and while I would be satisfied with us having less responsibilities, I would like to be able to hang out with our Scion friends, I've missed them and after finishing the MSQ I still miss them. I don't want new friends to go to adventures with, I want the friends I already have went through all these difficulties with, that were right beside me to the very end of existence. Before diving into the story I want to just say that apart from the story everything else is great! Soken has once again delivered with amazing pieces, bangers and emotional ones. The team that's responsible for areas and culture research has done a stellar job. I loved all the connections with Peruvian and other Latin American cultures. All areas look amazing and the over all graphics' update as well as other QoL updates have been spot on. And gameplay and new boss mechanics are refreshing, especially that spooky dungeon.  Yet, for a game that its primary sell point is its story I would not recommend Dawntrail, but I hope they pick up this disaster of an MSQ and fix it during the patches. [b]SPOILER AREA[/b]Now the common problem most people have is that Wuk Lamat is stuck on WoLs throat, and many people before me have stated the obvious problems with the character so I will try to not reiterate the rest of the reviews. It is not good storytelling to have ONLY ONE character move the entire story. I kept on feeling that I was being pulled and pushed around by a child I was for some reason given to babysit. And after meeting characters like Emet-Selch, Venat, Hythlodaeus, Ryne, Lyna, damn even Dulia-Chai, Wuk Lamat just fails to make me care for her. Is she a happy character? Yes. Does she have depth? No. Is she funny? Hell no. Returning to one of my primary points, good storytelling can be funny. Seriously who thought that making hunger and clumsiness jokes is good? Is she Luffy?? Well at least she became Hokage...The other 3 claimants are also extremely lacking. Koana was the most interesting, but we've got Bakool Ja Ja releasing a natural disaster beast on to the world and he gets away with it because he's emotional??? WHAT??? Did they think that the players are stupid? Zoraal Ja was just a plot device to get to the rest of the game. The reasons behind his ideals are not being touched upon (honestly at that point it felt like the writers had very low emotional maturity and emotional intelligence). You have poor Krile tell the player that Zoraal Ja is big-bad-guy. I don't want you to tell me, SHOW ME. Having a character say that another character is bad is just lazy writing. Finally, Sphene, I have no problem with Sphene, I believe she needed more screen time. [b]ULTRA BIG SPOILER AREA[/b]The last area of the game and the story telling at the last few quests was actually much much better, but let's see why. Putting big concepts about death and life, memories, souls and Azem aside that were very very interesting and engaging (finally). It was engaging because all the characters in our group spoke. We finally had a stroll with Raha, saw Krile's and Erenville's softer and more vulnerable side and the ongoing theme about family this expansion often discusses got a pay off here. I cried with both of them and I'm glad I got to experience those moments. But why did I not cry with Wuk Lamat's parents? Maybe because there was no emotional build up for those moments, compared to Krile and Erenville. I do not understand how that can happen when the same group of people write the same story. Maybe it's because when she met her biological father who gave her away to protect her she just ""brushed it off"". Lastly, what has left me disappointed is that there is clear connection to the WoL/Azem with the Sun, the logo of the expansion has a circle at the top reminiscent of the Azem symbol, we're all about the sun this the sun that, but the only thing we finally get about ourselves is just that that artifact is probably Azem's? I'm hoping they pick up from there, leave Wuk Lamat at home and give us more more Scions.",1720514190,18,0,negative

La expansión tiene puntos buenos, pero ha sido un bajón tremendo en la calidad de la historia. Puedo entender que es una introducción a un nuevo arco, pero que sea una introducción no significa que tenga que ser mala y/o aburrida. Todo el mundo habla de ""la primera parte"" es mala, ""la segunda"" es buena. Pero es que no es que la primera parte sea mala, ES QUE ESA ""PRIMERA PARTE"" SON 7 NIVELES DE LEVEO. Es decir, que es básicamente un 70% de la expansión lo que se considera malo y aburrido. En ese 70% hay puntos buenos pero contados con los dedos de una mano. El otro 30% mejora y es donde están las dungeons y trials que valen la pena, pero insisto, si tienes que hacer un 70% de tu expansión lenta por ser una ""introducción"", a lo mejor es que has fallado en el trabajo de escritura. Básicamente, solo en cuestión de la historia principal, sin contar post-parches, es el mismo ritmo que Stormblood, así que si no te gustó el ritmo de esa expansión, probablemente tampoco te guste el de esta. Y no, no lo digo por Wuk Lamat, ni porque su dobladora de voz sea transexual, eso me da igual y no es el problema de la expansión (que he visto que se ha generado polémica por eso, y una polémica muy estúpida, la verdad). De hecho, aunque cierto es que Wuk Lamat es un personaje que o lo odias o lo amas, a mí personalmente me ha gustado.

Because 99% of the MSQ you need to see her take the spotlight of every other character in the game, Erenville and Krile needed to bre protagonists in this expasion too, but wuk lamat was protagonists in all MSQ, beginning to end and it was so annoying after some pointHeavy spoilers:......After the rite ended and Wuk Lamat become the dawnservant i though ""ok, end of the wuk lamat, lets go for the rest of the dawntrail"" and i thought would just be us, the wol, in a adventure, but nope, we just had ONE map away of wuk lamat after the alexandria invasion she got back to be the protagonist for literal no reason, why she's the protagonist and not Erenvile or Krile?

It Should have ended there. The only reason this expansion exists is because WoW crashed and burned and People flocked to 14 during Shadowbringers and it made more Money then God. Endwalker was a fantastic ending to it all, post Endwalker... I have notes, mainly the Y'shtola character assassination but I digress. My major issue is Why are we here? We Literally have NO reason to be here except the new writer's OC dragged us out her for Some reason. It's way to disconnected to the point of it being Jarring. The new Hub Town is annoying to Navigate, And these Dungeon Mechanics are Borderline Masochistic.

I have played each and every expansion the day they released and have completed all stories without skipping, and I can confidently say this is the weakest story thus far. The story is not good, and has nothing to do with being a ""starting point for a new story."" It's also NOT due to not being the main character of this story. 99% of players would throw money at their screen to be a side character in a story about Zenos, Emet-Selch, or even Y'shtola. Wuk Lamat is just not well written (as a lot of other elements in this story are not) - no character development, her attitude and mannerisms are borderline childish, and good GRIEF her english VA is so bad. Enough with the wall of text, you'll get more than enough of that in the expansion.The good:Combat systems - The fights are great and the mechanics are really fun. The dungeons and trials truly shine and the duty team is really letting it fly with these fights.Viper and Pictomancer - Both good classes with a lot of hype and fun elements. (Please Yoshi-P don't dumb down Viper too much)Art - Everything looks good. Not much more I can really say here. The bad: MSQ Design - The main story quests design is starting to show its age. ""Talk to Wuk Lamat"" is like 80% of the quests and I wish I was kidding. This then kicks off lengthy cutscenes. We need more agency on the story or at least more engagement.Main Story Writing - The pacing is all over the place. For the first time in my 2500+ hours I skipped cutscenes in this expansion during a certain cooking quest because it would not stop and I was half falling asleep. It's just not good this time unfortunately.The ugly: English Voice Acting - Whoever decided Wuk Lamat's voice actor was fine should have their position in the company re-evaluated. It is not good by any stretch and I was forced swapped to Japanese. I would way rather listen to Minfilia and my OGs know how bad that got at times. Cutscenes - Why are some voiced and other CRUCIAL moments not voiced? Don't get me wrong, the parts with Wuk Lamat I was fine not being voiced but there's a lot of very important story beats that are just silent and are just text.

76561198025301084,0,0,english,"As a longtime FFXIV fan, I hate to admit it, but this expansion has some serious problems.[h3]First, the good:[/h3]Dawntrail’s combat is a massive improvement! Dungeons, trials, and the vanishingly few MSQ solo duties (we’ll get there) have all been phenomenal, with much more action and involvement than previous expansions. Additionally, the consequences for failing a combat mechanic are harsher, which makes playing correctly feel important for the first time in a long while.The setting is phenomenal. Each zone is beautiful, expansive, and interesting! The lore is also fascinating and leaves plenty of starting points for new stories, both big and small. The graphics update brings the game forward a solid 5 or 6 years in terms of fidelity, and the music is technically well-executed (if a little out of place). Finally, all of the non-combat content, like crafting, gathering, and fishing are still fantastic, as usual.EDIT: Finally, before I start ragging on the story, I should say that the ""bones"" of the story had great potential. The themes of compassion, culture, understanding, and duty could have been fantastic, and the various foils to Wuk's naivety could have been fascinating. If the writers had handled this better, I have no doubt it would have been amazing![h3]Now, the bad:[/h3]FFXIV is primarily sold and marketed as being “the one MMO with a good story,” and up until now, it succeeded spectacularly at that. There were occasional dips in quality, but from start to finish the characters were consistent and compelling, and the plot moved forward with an understandable logic. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case (bear with me, please).The story in Dawntrail had great potential from its premise. The player, a famous adventurer who has saved multiple worlds at this point, is in desperate need of a vacation along with their friends, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Conveniently, a new character has shown up, Wuk Lamat, and she needs help to win the throne of her homeland, Tuliyollal. This sets up the player as a mentor and occasional helping hand in Wuk’s journey across the tropical lands of Tural, giving them and the Scions the low-stakes vacation they’ve been hoping for. For some added drama, a few of the Scions have chosen to help Wuk’s brother, Koana, win the throne instead, setting the player up to occasionally fight against their own best friends down the road. Excitement!This premise has everything players wanted: lower stakes, a tropical vacation, and some safe drama. Sadly, this is not what actually happens. Instead, Dawntrail is 90% cutscenes and dialogue about how cool Wuk Lamat is. And I say this as someone who likes her! Her character was part of that strong premise I outlined, and I was looking forward to seeing more of her, just not nothing but her.While the player does superficially take on the role of mentor to Wuk Lamat, this never amounts to anything. Instead, Wuk goes on her journey to win the throne largely alone, and the player stands in the background. They never train her, nor do they offer any of their adventuring expertise. Any time a decision needs to be made, a new character walks on screen to outline what Wuk needs to do. The player helps with menial tasks by clicking on things occasionally, but the story would not change if they disappeared. The same can be said for the Scions.On that note, any character from a previous expansion has lost their personality and mannerisms in Dawntrail. Every non-Wuk Lamat character is the same person with the same voice. They all react to things in the same way, and very rarely give personal input based on their prior experiences in the story (barring one great cutscene near the end with G’raha). And Wuk Lamat doesn’t benefit from this deficiency at all; her character stays the same from start to finish, with the only thing changing being her confidence in how cool she is.Halfway through the story, a natural stopping point for Wuk’s journey presents itself, and most players would assume that other characters (for example, the two characters advertised as having a big story in this expansion, Krile and Erenville), would finally have time to be in cutscenes and say things. This is not the case. After the big turn in the plot, Wuk volunteers to lead the group into the new development, and everyone placidly nods and follows her out of the room, with Krile and Erenville remaining silent and largely absent. The rest of the story plays out the same way as above, with Wuk doing everything by herself with the help of random characters appearing from off-screen to explain things. And again, I like her! I like Wuk Lamat! This is a writing problem, not a character problem.I think this problem is best exemplified by the final fight (no spoilers). This fight is meant to make sure the player has one shining moment to show off the strength and resolve they’ve developed over their illustrious career of saving worlds, after giving Wuk Lamat her own heroic journey the rest of the time. At least, that’s what you would expect. But no, Wuk Lamat literally breaks through space and time to jump in front of us and beat the final boss by herself. She then leads the heroes back home while an off-brand Disney high school song plays. Final reminder, I like Wuk Lamat.While the hyperfocus on a single character is the main problem with the story, there are other issues that can’t be ignored. The plot has several severe holes that are never addressed, and multiple climactic moments are cut short by unexpected anticlimaxes. A few battles happen either off-screen or in cutscenes, where in previous expansions these fights would have made for interesting solo duties. Considering the massive improvement in fight design, this absence of content is particularly painful. Also, remember the “low stakes vacation with safe drama” I mentioned earlier? None of that happens. The universe is threatened yet again, we never sip a margarita or hit the beach, and we never have any conflict with our friends, safe or otherwise. None of the advertised points deliver.Finally, the pacing is especially glacial, even for FFXIV. Every step of the story is punctuated by having to talk to multiple random, nameless NPCs, who provide no relevant information. A cutscene then plays where the characters discuss back and forth the fact that they have no new information. A new character then runs in and provides the one piece of information they were missing, kicking off the next round of talking to random, nameless NPCs. This cycle repeats for about 40 hours straight. In previous expansions, those slow moments at least felt productive for the plot and characters. In Dawntrail, it’s nothing but killing time.Story isn’t the only problem this expansion has, unfortunately. The English localization is markedly worse than previous expansions, excluding ARR. Characters have voices that don’t match, dialogue has factual errors (no Wuk, the giants aren’t from Kozama’uka, they’re from Urqopacha. Get it together!), and many voice lines are either poorly mixed or bad takes. Whoever CBU3 had approving voice lines for the English performances needs to be reprimanded. Characters mispronounce words, “pretend-shout” when they should be shouting, and just plain sound bored. If the characters are bored, imagine how the player feels![h3]Wrapping up:[/h3]In conclusion, most elements of the game are improved in Dawntrail, but the biggest failure of the expansion happens to be its most important. When you advertise yourself as having an emotional story and compelling characters, providing neither is a major misstep. Will I keep playing? Absolutely. The gameplay is phenomenal and I’m still holding out hope that the writers figure things out. But this expansion has made me nervous about the future, which is not a great feeling to get from your favorite game.",1720481928,701,10,negative

Your character is a cameraman who will nod and agree with everything Wuk does. Your character will hand over ALL credit to Wuk Lamat. There is a literal ""Poochie moment"" where characters literally ask, ""Where is Wuk Lamat?"" when Wuk Lamat is not on screen. Wuk is a black hole where everything gravitates around her antics.There is also horrendous EN voice direction in not only Wuk, but others as well. Wuk, being the main character for the story, highlights it the most. The main cast will deliver lines with a flat voice while the character model is filled with movement and emotion. Critical scenes become hilarious when characters' facial models are animated, but the characters speaks in lowercase. You can compare scenes in different languages to see how the scenes are noticeably jarring. There are volume normalization problems in the late game for some of the minor/background characters. A background character has a loud volume single line before the voice volume returns to normal.There was a seal of approval before launching, but the audio is not up to par with voice acting from the late 90's or the early 2000's.There is no vacation.

76561198222619884,259888,243,english,"[h3] [b] THE WORST WRITING YOU CAN POSSIBLY EXPERIENCE [/b] [/h3]I finally finished DT and feel overall really impressed by it—Square managed to produce the [b] worst [/b] story I've experienced within over a decade and charge $40 for it.  I am piling on another negative review while it's still mixed because it feels less pointless right now while people are divided.First I wanna say that the new zones/areas, environments etc are really nice to look at and well done.  The dungeons and trials have been fun and they brought some fresh gameplay for the players (when they can actually get to it). But the story is just so bad it's impossible to just pretend like you weren't just served sewage in a glass and told 'drink up'. I understand players should expect a more relaxed, lower-stakes story after a big story concludes that that doesn't mean they should be served steaming hot garbage made with 0 effort.[h3] Part 1 [/h3]  The pacing and MSQ slog of the first half felt like tedious filler where you: move around to different areas on the map > waste your time reading tons of dialogue that doesn't mean anything significant > be delivered the same overall message of the story again (but this time the society is wearing different clothes than the last one so somehow that makes it more meaningful), and repeat.  It's a reskin of Stormblood's Gyr Abania half of the xpac (except now you have Wuk Lamat instead of Lyse) but at least the zones are prettier and has nicer scenery than STB).I was excited to put that behind and move on to the second half until the next plot actually kicks off.  This is where it becomes the worst writing in history—the first half was barely a story so its sins were more forgivable.  You can tell the zone/city ideas were designed first and then the plot cohesion was just throwing darts on a wall to find ways to somehow make them cohesive.[h3] Part 2 [/h3] It is apparent from the get-go that the producers were not exaggerating when they said they're going to avoid making things dark/serious from now on; the plot is a ZERO STAKES plot.  The game storyboard relies on the player to have their hand held and spoonfed the narrative, and completely hinges on half-ass attempts to make players emotional with emotional scenes (likely attempting to recreate some of the success of Endwalker since it was well-received) but...Apparently couldn't be bothered to actually MAKE things emotional - either due to laziness or because the idea of making things dark is somehow much scarier to them than serving the players steamed garbage on a plate, I'm not sure. SPOILERS AHEADTheir systematic method of 'keeping things light but make it emotional' was as follows:  [spoiler]Introduce new character > barely give them screen time > sad music plays as the obvious thing happens that was death-coded from day one.[/spoiler]  Like, they were so resistant to making the story have anything dark in it that they inserted so many bs loopholes to circumvent any stakes or hard decisions. Their way of 'fixing' any plot stakes or possible moral ambiguity was [spoiler] Dawnservant?  He was already dying anyway which is why the succession plot was even happening.  The antagonists army?  Well, you don't need to feel bad about people cutting them down because they're just robot soldiers and not people.  The Endless?  Yeah, they're AI so they're not alive so you don't have to feel bad about it...Same with Sphene.  Not to mention the game in that whole last zone has Endless npc chars pop up just to inorganically reiterate to the player that ""we're actually okay with dying, we encourage this.  This is the only option"" in a way that you can just tell they really felt the need to baby the player to make sure the player doesn't try to think any deeper on any of this...[/spoiler][h3] How [b]every single aspect of the plot[/b] was lazy COPY AND PASTE FROM PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS: (SEE LIST) [/h3] And the biggest crime of all was the second half's complete rehash of story themes that have ALREADY BEEN USED in other xpac MSQ's.  I can't think of a single novel theme/arc in this one that wasn't just reusing an old one but being 10x lazier and making it 10x worse.  For example: [spoiler] - The last zone is a bad rehash of Amaurot/The Ancients storyline. To quote a friend, ""echoes of a long destroyed civilization being propped up by a single authority figure who can't let go of the past"" [/spoiler][spoiler] -  Along with the poor rehashing of Amaurot's plot theme, the whole 'goodbye to Endless npc after emotional scene as they die' is a direct bad rehash of Endwalker's Ultima Thule...Because this time they are characters we barely know and just met and, again, they are not alive, remember? (: [/spoiler][spoiler] - Sphene being a rehash of Meteion, making a cute/youthful/sweet girl end up being the big bad, same sort of internal turmoil throughout the arc, making the same pained ""I don't wanna do this"" faces to tell the player they're a good person and that you're supposed to like them etc etc.  Lots of similar forced narrative overlap. And they still did Meteion better...[/spoiler][spoiler] - Most of the AI / tech themes were already explored in Omega raid series (and Omega sidequests), which was also written better.  Remember Omega and the Omicrons with the whole ""we're no longer human, just memories so don't feel bad about killing us""[/spoiler]Despite how bad the story was, I was actually enjoying the last trial until [spoiler]that mid-trial cutscene/event, and you KNOW the one I'm talking about.  Ruined the moment hard.[/spoiler]TLDR; I'd rather play ARR and STB back to back than ever touch this story again, the last half felt like physical torture to go on. Shadowbringers was truly the writing peak of the series.  Wuk Lamat is so forced into every part of the story and dialogue it's absurd.  Also they nerfed Thancred's eyebrows in DT.  Square really fumbled and hopefully enough of the playerbase has the media literacy to not just give a pass.

Not sure if they wanted me to feel like a bad guy through half of it but having just finished the MSQ well, here we are.We are not the main character this time which I'm fine with. EW wrapped up our story nicely as far as I'm concerned.Voice acting is good from the usual players but the new voices are hit or miss. Wuk Lamat and Cahciua are two notably terrible ones that had me wanting to switch languages half way through. If you can't read a line properly they shouldn't let you in the sound booth. Really pulled me out of the moment from time to time. The dungeons are great, the trials are fun and filled with new mechanics to trip you up once or twice.Most of the music is great (end song is rubbish) and the new graphics upgrade is welcome.Story has a serious problem with tone in places. Characters being happy when me and gf were wondering why they weren't sad like us, happy music in sad places, sad music in happy places, just inconsistencies that your subconscious will notice even if you don't. Entire final zone is a prime example IMO.Slight spoilers maybe: [spoiler] I don't mind the fact that Wuk Lamat is the main character this xpac. After EW wrapped up 10 years of story for me it's a nice change of pace. And if you want 10 more years of great story then you need a good fresh base to launch it from with new friends / enemies etc. Problem is they only made us a body guard and servant of Wuk Lamat. She didn't learn anything from us because Wuk was perfect from the start. They already loved helping people, they already had a heart of gold, they were already amazing they just needed muscle for the competition and to beat up her brothers. I realized at one point I felt more like Alfred than Batman during the MSQ. [/spoiler]Major story spoilers: [spoiler] The final zone feels like a total screw up on the writers part. The entire fight with Sphene felt forced and the murder of her Endless citizens needlessly cold. Here we are, in a new reflection with access to the last leader from it and the entire thing is squandered. All the history and knowledge destroyed by shutting down their terminals.  Know what could have saved the Endless and Sphene? A simple trade contract for animals etc with any of the nations, how many souls could she possibly need? Her Endless city was already running low, she wouldn't have the military might to take on everyone we can muster. Did she not pay attention when we killed the King?

These 3 places can easily be compared to Uldah, Limsa, and Gridania with just a much smaller impact on the world. The Writing will even make ""references"" to how similar they are to other cultures we already know...The writing is also so beyond predictable its horrendous. The moment any problem pops up some character will instantly show up with the solution. Non spoilery example: ""We need to track this big beast, how will we track it at its high speed and multiple elemental typings."" character pulls out a cartoon hand that can track a specific element. Player proceeds to use hand to track ONLY ONE TYPE. After no luck, ""hmm, maybe it cant track due to the multiple elements"" Beast proceeds to let out a scream nearby and player goes to fight it...like...really.The worst thing of all is the villains which are also just comparable to A Realm Reborn, or even (and i hate to say it) WOW SHADOWLANDS. Your shown one villain, but that villain gets redeemed (very well i will add its a good part), but then the guy that's ""totally not the twist villain"" becomes the main villain, and then there's a character you think will be an ally (just like Thancred in arr) but nope, becomes the main final villain that actually orchestrated the main conflict.I was willing to give this writer a shot, but this is beyond bad to the point I'm not willing to give her one.Everything else is sub par, the new zones are again very comparable to previous zones (hell 3 are basically the same agriculturally) The Music is mostly fantastic as well as the dungeons and the 2 main towns. But there are also some out of nowhere high school musical track that feels so out of place it ruins the emotion its trying to portray. In the end, this expansion just feels like filler. Nothing serious or gamechanging happened besides the possibilities left in mystery at the end which is okay...but that's what endwalker's post content did too and it just feels tiring.

There HAS to be more gameplay variety than just walking from NPC to NPC, clicking on them, watching 20 mins of cutscenes, and repeat. Especially when ~80% of the cutscene content is unvoiced, exposition dump, filler BS.There are strong story, character, and design elements in DT. I like all four Dawnservant claimants and the new races and cultures. But their presentation is mired by horrid pacing and tired, outdated visual-novel-style storytelling. There are moments in the story when it’s genuinely exciting, but then immediately murders its own momentum: “Holy crap, we finally found the golden city! Except now you need to go gather bags of animal droppings with Erenville for a while.” Or, ""Wow, you're only 5 quests away from the end! Sounds like a good time for a history lesson about Lala from different worlds!""The dungeon, trial, and raid content is top-tier, and will keep me logging in through this expansion’s life cycle, but the MSQ should not feel like a sleepy slog that we have to push through to get to the good stuff.

The zones are beautiful, the graphics update is great, the trials and dungeons are phenomenal and Soken has hit it out the park yet again with another incredible soundtrack. Basically everything but the story (my main reason for playing the game) is great in Dawntrail.I was a bit apprehensive going into Dawntrail as we'd just agreed to help a woman we just met become the next ruler of a nation we knew nothing about, without doing any due diligence to see if she is the best candidate for the job. It seemed like a bit too much of an irresponsible thing for us to be doing. But FFXIV has had low points in its story before and managed to salvage it so I had faith they could pull it off again. They didn't.Without getting into spoilers, Dawntrail's story is filled with plot holes, poor dialogue and nonsensical decisions by the characters. Most of the scions are only there for duty support and set dressing ,and if they weren't there, nothing in the plot would change. This includes the player character. I've seen people say that the player acts as a mentor to Wuk Lamat, they are wrong. At no point do we ever give advise to Wuk Lamat, teach Wuk Lamat, nudge Wuk Lamat in the right direction, nothing. We are nothing more than what the NPC's call us, 'Wuk Lamat's attendant."" I knew we weren't going to be the main character and I was fine with that; I've liked story games where you play a supporting character before (heck even some stories in FFXIV don't have you take leading role). But in those cases your character still has an impact on the plot, here your entirely unnecessary. This is made worse by the fact that there numerous points in the story where your character can and should do/say something but doesn't, which can make the player character come across as a bit evil.I mentioned Wuk Lamat earlier and she has so much screen time in this that it would be difficult to review this expansion without talking about her. Aside from a short filler interlude in the middle, which happens to be my favourite part, she is a constant in the story. This means that if you do not like Wuk Lamat, you will probably not like the story regardless of whether its other flaws bother you. Personally I did not mind her for most of the expansion, though by the end I was definitely tired of her. It also unfortunately meant less time for other characters to develop, which was a real shame as there were a bunch I wanted to see more of.As a last note, while the zones in Dawntrail are all brilliantly crafted and beautiful to look at, zone 6 was so different from everything else in FFXIV that it was jarring.

In years to come this will be remember as a great start to yet another amazing story.That being said...If you value the MSQ above all else (like myself), this is the weakest base MSQ they have ever had. The writing is a roller coaster of bad to great. The pacing is also all over the place and in some instances feels like they had 2 writing teams work on this. There are high moments but few and far between the overall lows. The main issue is this expansion is mainly a character focus on Wuk Lamat. If you do not take to her character then you are forced to be her Robin (she being Batman) as she plays the role of the WoL. I myself find her very unlikable, annoying, and horribly written. It was a mistake by the devs to place so much focus on one character when the rest of the NEW (and old) cast in the MSQ is amazing (minus the twins, dunno why they came). Those are the characters I want to spend time with but instead... we're stuck with Wuk Lamat. If you enjoy Wuk Lamat, disregard my negativity but like so many I couldn't wrap my head around why we and other important characters were set aside for Wuk Lamat's story.

I took multiple breaks because the story couldn't get me hooked.This expansions story is about Wuk Lamat a Tulari princess. She hogs a lot of the screentime in all of the mainstory.You aren't the main character this time, so a big factor to liking this story is liking Wuk Lamat.However she isn't a good enough character to carry the story, to have her be a narrative black hole like she is.Shes a naive and easily fooled idealist. She makes mistakes just in line for that kind of character. Repeatedly. Shes never really punished or challenged. Those kinda mistakes have been punished in the story before (Alphinaud and Nanamo).The problem about the narrative black hole isn't her fault, but shes forced into our face basically every chance they get.Even players who like her get weary from that. Shes chained to our side, it becomes suffocating.Many other characters are characterised by their relationship to Wuk Lamat, while some seem have lost their personality. (Krile not teasting Alphinaud, Alisaies sarcasm) They all seem to have the same personality in Dawntrail. They blend into the background if they have nothing to say.

It's fed to you as if you were the target audience of said Disney writing, and leaves nothing up to inference or mystery. Explains everything in plain words, instead of leaving anything up to intrigue. We're in an unknown land for goodness sake, there should be something that's a mystery. On top of that, some of the zones feel like ripoffs of SB areas (Notably the 4th & 6th area) with none of the good parts, trying to capitalise on that success and nostalgia. Wuk Lamat's voice talent is honestly terrible. Her lines (in English) are so badly delivered, phoned in, canned, whatever you want to call it. Wouldn't be a big deal if she didn't talk for 95% of the main scenario quests, but we're taking a supporting character role in this expansion, so she does. There's some emotional moments (high and low) involving her that are entirely ruined by the delivery of lines. The writing is also rubbish, like a mix between an anime protagonist and a Disney princess.Overall, the gameplay is fun, that being dungeons, trials, and the class changes. I love this game, having almost 3,000 hours as of writing, but this is the first time I've felt like they've missed the mark badly.If you don't have a high cringe tolerance, and think you'll have $30 in the future, consider a story skip ticket for when the next expansion comes out to avoid this. I just hope post-patch content can redeem this expansion going forward.Finally, it would be remiss of me to not mention the excellent job that Erenville's VA did.

The questing has never been more painful. Character's are basically bad anime tropes. IDK who thought it would be a good idea to be tied to Wuk the entire time, but I'm so tired of how bland and one dimensional she is. She acts like a naive child, which can work as a side character, but not the main character that she is in this story. I actually kinda liked her when she was introduced in Endwalker. Maybe I was just relieved to be done with the (imo) terrible post-endwalker zero storyline. Also, a lot of the scions act totally out of character too. It's really discouraging that they would allow such inconsistent and low-quality writing in the MSQ. I get some people actually enjoyed the story, which is good for them, no hate.

I DON'T CARE, I'M THE WARRIOR OF LIGHT! I WANT TO BEAT GODS AND VILLAINS SENSELESS, NOT DO ALL THIS GARBAGE! it feels as if they've forgotten this is a final fantasy game. it was like i was playing a visual novel. and yes, this was supposed to be like a summer vacation type vibe for the story... but history has proven that there are more engaging and fun ways to tell a story. i hope they look back, learn and apply that in the next expansion's msq. okay, so the content of the story was bad, but don't even get me started on the CHEESY ass writing. I'm not even joking, it was disney channel level writing. just downright cringe and annoying. a far cry from the S-tier writing in shadowbringers and most of endwalker. strictly speaking, i'm only giving this a bad review because i thought the story was bad. the actual combat content was amazing and i'm definitely looking forward to all the cool stuff they're gonna add over the next few years. and i just want to say we have reached a peak in job design. picto and viper are insanely fun to play. so it's not ALL bad, i'm still invested in the game... i will just skip all the cutscenes from now on lol.",1720415782,13,1,negative

Not necessarily because of the plot or pacing, but the lack of voiced cutscenes compared to ShB and Endwalker is honestly awful in comparison. Barely 1 in 5 cutscenes are voiced at all, and most of the ones that are tend to be pretty short. It's crazy to me that the mobile games I play nowadays have more fully voice-acted cutscenes than an MMO that I pay a monthly subscription fee AND an entry-fee for the expansion. It feels extremely cheap and makes me just skip every cutscene that wasn't voiced. If the developers can't be bothered to put voice-acting in the cutscene, I'll just assume it's unimportant. Because if they don't care that much, why should I?I can't really recommend it, especially to new players. The lack of effort puts it around post-ARR or post-Heavensward content for story engagement. Unless someone is dedicated to the raiding scene or really, REALLY wants to play the new classes, you're better off waiting to buy this expac until the next one comes out or until they add a lot more gameplay content in the 7.3-7.5 patches.",1720412790,12,1,negative

I'M EXHAUSTED FROM BOREDOM PLAYING THIS. But lets start with the good first and the good is very good.1. Class changes aside from some minor adjustments that are already planned to be fixed have been fantastic. as someone who got all classes to max and mains dark knight i have been loving how the classes play.2. Music is fantastic. If a bit unfitting in some areas (the jazz while nice is a bit unfitting for a south america locations. is still great to listen to and is not unwelcome)3. Graphics update is great5. dungeons and bosses are fantastic, just wish players stop being on auto pilot as there's a lot of people who seem to be used to not paying attention, but this will be fixed when people get more used to the fights. +++DAWNTRAIL SPOILERS+++Now for the Bad, and its mostly to do with the story and how it execution harms the good points stated above.1. The names for locations, people, and others are way too long and sometimes hard to pronounce and memorize. This might not be an issue 2 years in but right now its hard to coordinate teleport points or when treasure hunts happen. I can see typing locations to be a pain in text chat box.2. On the topic of characters naming is the most minor thing. The bigger issue is the story is all over the place. Characters who seem important get shafted halfway through so we don't get time to appreciate them or see them grow (BaKool Ja ja is the best example of this.) But what you get is the introduction of the wider cast with the Promises, the Dawn Servant, And the people of Turial, only for them to be shafted halfway through the story. Only for the story to REINTRODUCE A NEW SET OF CHARACTERS HALFWAY THROUGH AND DO IT IN LESS TIME. 3. The story is too long and without substance, leading to needless padding. Started playing with my and my friends around noon. and by the end of the day at nearly 10pm we had JUST reached the first dungeon, no trial in sight. The padding of pointless sidequests, long cutscenes that say nothing and a focus on Wuk Lamat (Ill get to her later) lead to our enjoyment and exploration of the locations we encounter feeling boring. For a land inspired by the Americas there's a shocking lack of adventure, it really says something when the EW post expansion had a better feeling of ""fresh start adventure"" than the entirety of Dawntrail had.4. Alexandria being the poster child for MMO bloat. After the trailers showing off the new land of Turail, the south american adventure, the culture, the festivity, only to play through the expansion and to have the gate to the golden city JINGLED in front of us only to go ""nah ignore that"" really stings, and is even worse when quite literally the Resilient Son vanishes for an hour and him, and high tech world come out of left field with minimal build up. From here all you learned about Turial becomes moot as now you have to learn about the new lore for this mysterious land that attacks you, has no connection to Turial in ANY WAY, and to make it worse there's also a 30 YEAR TIME SKIP....SO WE HAVE TO LEARN 30 YEARS WORTH OF LORE FOR AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED IN MOST AN HOUR.5. Weak Villains overall with no clear villain throughout the entire Expansion. In HW it was Thordin and Nidhog, In Stormblood it was the Garleans, Shadow Bringers it was the Light, Vauthry, and Emet Selch. EW it was Zodiark and the final failures of the ascians come to haunt the modern day, all of which was built up since Stormblood. The ascians had acted as background villains to move the plot along since 1.0 with the main villains of each expansion being assisted by them. Here, no such idea exists, and the story jumps Villains when not needed anymore.  With Bakool Ja Ja getting rushed development (Still love our boy) To the Resilient Son's Motive, and finally Sphene being the villain out of a MASSIVE flimsy excuse and motives that the story itself even points are inconsistent. On the topic of Zoraal Ja, The Resilient Son. he as a VERY weak villain as his characterization seems to be muddied and inconsistent at best. What we do know is this: He has feelings of Inadequacy due to his birth being a miracle, and thus having to live up to his father, and that hes a militarist. This is where our knowledge of him stops. WHY hes a conqueror is not know and his personal beliefs are not known, maybe its because he wants more land for his people?? but Turial has never been show to be lacking in resources (minus a storm but that's natural) nor has it been shown hes competent as his intro is talking about how he LOST a military campaign. these plot points are never addressed and the story assumes hes just petty and wants the crown so bad! but because we never spend time with him, get to know his points, or even get his mindset he flops. at base he wants to prove himself by being a king for the people...So why, WHY does he go to future kingdom, take it over, oppress the people for 30 years, have a kid for NO reason, and still decided ""I need to kill my dad and take Turial"" the character changes on a dime.Then theres Wuk lamat6. Wuk Lamat, Dear heavens above Wuk Lamat, The pinnacle of everything wrong with this Expansion. To start this character was introduced late into EW, Unlike other expansions leading into the new one the final update finally introduces her. I had a gut feeling about her when she was introduced with her being little too upbeat and in your face, with attempts to make the players like her right off the bat with comical moments and quotes. The character came off having very similar tropes to a shonen protagonist akin to luffy or naruto. But with her being unable to fully commit to battle I thought that this could lead to an interesting flaw ""they want to be Dawn Servant but lack the resolve to do anything."" This flaw is barely addressed and is soon forgotten about. But lets start with the biggest issue, the Story is OBSESSED with her, to the point shes considered the main character and it comes at a detriment because shes very unlikable and the story seems to bend itself over for her. She lacks flaws other than what was mentioned above and that she ""cares too much about people"" which hinders the exploration. people have often said that the WoL isn't the MC of this adventure to where I ask ""Why aren't we?"" Wuk Lamat is from this new world, but always takes our chances to learn about people.Its Wuk Lamat who rides the floats, solves the problems, kills the bosses, tames the Llamas, becomes Dawn Servant, Knows the people, WoL? whos that? Wuk of Lamat? Now watch her become Dawn Servant with her equally forgettable cat brother. Watch ass scions, including you, gas her up and fawn over her and cheer her on as she solves EVERYONES problems but makes US do everything. This could've been an interesting flaw with how she relies on outside help too much but once again the story is too busy congratulating her to know this. And finally halfway through the story where she finally looks like she will retire and we can go on an adventure SHE COMES BACK. The story focuses on her too much, to the point its at our detriment without any reason for us to care or like her. It doesn't help that her VA work is very flat, talking normally is fine but any amount of cadence or emotion falls flat and seems like a line read, the VA being inexperienced doesn't help nor does Wuk Lamat having more voice lines that any character by far. At the end of the day I dont think Wuk lamat could be salvaged, even if they got better reads or VA I think that FF14 team has a large uphill battle for the story and it starts with retiring Wuk Lamat.",1720411103,21,1,negative

Several times the game will show you a cutscene of some stuff about to happen and make you excited to engage with said stuff only to rip it away from you and make you do one to two hours of unrelated fetch quest type stuff before you are allowed to have fun. To anyone who has any kind of time constraints in real life, this is not acceptable. I work full time and I only have three hours per weekday to play, and to have the game so obsessed with wasting as much of it on menial content is insulting. FF does not include a month of sub with buying an expansion. I paid to have my time wasted for 20 hours praying for the next combat content to arrive. Instead it was hours of ""Speak to Wuk Lamat"". All of the areas could have easily cut two hours of nothingburger ""content"" and the story would not have changed.Either the quota for ""average time required to beat MSQ"" needs to go or you have to have more substance in your story. The current formula does not work.The combat content this time around is a step up from previous expacs and actually engaging, which I like.However, additions for jobs have been middling to extremely lazy for the most part, such as upgrading role actions.

I think the zones and battle content are some of the best yet, and the music is excellent, but the MSQ greatly soured the whole experience for me. I was enjoying it for about the first half despite some *interesting* story decisions, but by the time I got to the last third of the MSQ I was completely checked out emotionally. It felt like the writers were trying to make me feel things but failing miserably, especially in the last third story of the story. Maybe it was a ""death by a thousand cuts"" sort of thing for me. I'll try not to get excessively spoilery in this review but I will obviously be discussing the story so be warned.I really wanted to like Wuk Lamat, but at this point I'd be very happy not to ever have to see her again. Some of her ""development"" didn't really feel earned, and I wish that there was more showing and less telling when it came to her ideals. I think it's tempting for some to solely blame the English VA but there's only so much one can do with voice direction and script they're given. There's only so much repetition of the phrase ""my people"" that I can take, and this was greatly exceeded. Unfortunately in the last third of the MSQ another character began over-using this phrase and that's about when I'd had enough. I don't hate Wuk Lamat's guts but I really REALLY could have used some more space from her. After a while I audibly sighed every time I was separated from the Scions to go do something with her as my sole companion.Speaking of the Scions, it really felt like they were there for the Duty Support system and that's it. The player character hardly gets to spend any time with them, and their interactions are usually limited to backing up Wuk Lamat verbally during whatever story beat was going on. I've heard others describe them as ""cardboard cutouts"" of themselves and unfortunately I have to agree. I may be in the minority on still enjoying the Scions, but I really missed them despite them technically being there. The extent of ""competition"" story beat that was hyped up was like 10 seconds in a dungeon, no joke. Also I really wish Krile's and Erenville's arcs would have gotten more time and focus than they did.I didn't really find any of the villains compelling and some of the motivations didn't really make sense to me. There was also a character that IMO got a very undeserved 180 in personality, outlook, and treatment. I feel like saying anything else on this subject would be too spoilery.Hmm, other things. There were plenty of plot points here and there that felt contrived. At one point the WoL and the other Scions prove themselves to somehow be the worst bodyguards ever. Another contestant for the throne breaks a competition rule that is outright stated early on but doesn't get disqualified, and the fact that they broke the rule is never commented on. There was also foreshadowing of a certain character possibly having their own agenda outside of the contest of the throne, but they are killed off without fanfare or any reveal of their intentions. There are several scenarios where the WoL and co kind of stand around and watch as something bad happens, and rarely is there an explanation for why. Moral questions are posed in the last third of the game and then never really feel like they are adequately answered. I feel like it would be hyperbole to say that Dawntrail is worse than ARR given how much better its battle content, zones, and music are but  as far as the story I think I did enjoy myself much less. I've never actually disliked a MSQ story before this one. None of the previous stories have had me praying for it to just be over already. FWIW I enjoyed the melee role quest, the expert dungeons, and I'm a bit interested in the hinted direction of where the story could go next. But the overwhelming feeling for me right now is just disappointment and sadness. I hope the patch stories are a lot better because otherwise I think my days of playing this game are numbered.",1720392495,32,0,negative

[/h1]There's so many things extremely wrong in this new expansion so many...The story of Dawntrail, is one of the worst i ever seen.

[/h2]Let's start with the fact, many pepole (me included) was curious of the new jobs, The Viper is very cool and very fast with nice skills and the combat style it uses, the pictomancer is funny to use for main casters. (Not in my case.)The ambience (with one exception) it looks good, Tuliyollal have a chill BGM it looks an vacation village, probably because is inspired by latin america locations, if wasn't the fact there's a zone reminded me a little wild arms and of course the final area.The dungeons and trials are a little challenging with little addictions, considering the side note i progressed in the expansion with 660 of item level on the entire time and the final trial was chaotic in mechanics.About the new graphical update i couldn't pretend much for an 2010 engine but is much clean with new dynamic lights and few improvements of the textures and models.[h2] But all these new stuff they added and graphical update with 2 new jobs, it will not save this expansion from what it deserves. [/h2]""It's not just about telling a story, but taking into consideration the emotions of the player.I think that characters are born from a story; I rarely come up with the character first and then build a story around them.""This quote is from Kazutoyo Maehiro, one of the best writer in FF14 history and one of the creators of Havensward, one of the expansions with the best story between the others....but dawntrail story lead by Daichi Hiroi....Is a Storytelling failure.All i felt in the entire dawntrail MSQ, aren't good emotions.....just boredom, repulsion, cringe and anger in negative way, and i skipped the majority of the cutscenes and painful fetch quests, all i saw from the rest i didn't skipped is below average even for FF14 standards, i know our WoL is in vacation on the first part but at least involve WoL in something exciting and fun, [spoiler] the only fun part of the story on the first half was sparring with Gulool Ja Ja with the cool music of the trailer, for the rest is one of the ridiculous trials to become the future ruler of Tuliyollal i couldn't imagine, with all the trials someone can think in a competition to become the heir of the throne they choose the worst. Normally if you want put someone in the condition to rule a kingdom, you need to test him to see if it's ready for the throne in the future, testing the courage, the strength, the skill in battle and the intelligence to resolve problems and guide the troops to war, why i say these examples?..well...because the rite of succession is one of the stupidiest contest i ever seen, and there's many better ideas than capturing an alpaca, cooking, find someone to craft a vase ecc....the only good part of the rite of the succession was fighting the illusion of Gulool Ja Ja and nothing else. [/spoiler] To make things worse is the desperate attempt to look Wuk Lamat as protagonist setting aside the WoL with the other scions for the entire MSQ, [spoiler] Krile excluded. [/spoiler] Wuk Lamat is the classic airhead but more annoying, with the childish utopia of eternal peace and she litreally intervenes everytime she have the chance and sometimes It was very forced in some cutscenes and it's embaracing and stupid, [spoiler] For example in the second phase of the final trial, instead of G'raha Tia or Krile, only Wuk Lamat appears with an annoying force. [/spoiler] [spoiler] The other characters like Zoraal Ja and Bakool Ja Ja are a wasted potential to be nice characters in the story, Zoral Ja (Jotaro's Voice XD) it was irrilevant but decent, even after he turns to be the villain and his fight it was amazing. Bakool Ja Ja....is just a banal bully who becomes good after being beaten, but not by the WoL...i let you guys guess who beats Bakool Ja Ja. [/spoiler] Every single MSQ quest have always most of the time these 4 words ""Talk to Wuk Lamat"" over and over and over and over, and the high level of cringe dialogues in some quests turns the fetch quests and cutscenes in general into a painful torture, too many gags and setting aside the WoL, even the rest of the scions are beign setting aside [spoiler] in fact estinien rarely appeared at difference of the other scions (Poor Estinien). [/spoiler]Now let's get to the worst location of the new continent, Solution Nine is unforgivable and very out of place in a game like final fantasy, and the BGM....it's truly unbearable, for the sake of my sanity anytime i had to go there i turn the BGM off and i hated every minute anytime i set foot in that place.Wuk Lamat is one of the worst characters ever made, no development, no intresting backstory, absolutely nothing and annoying like a mosquito when you try to sleep.In conclusion of this review and half rant, this new expansion beyond the graphic update, the new continent and the new classes, the storytelling is a complete disaster and unsufficient for the final fantasy standards...and im honestly worried of the future of FF14 one of the best MMORPG i spent 6 years, because if this is new lead story designer vision for the future journey of WoL this will make many pepole skip all everything and many story enjoyers will be disappointed from this direction is going to be......Daichi Hiroi, hope you will see the feedback of how wrong is this story and make at least the endgame MSQ intresting because otherwise, many pepole will abandon FF14 forever.[h1] Final Verdict for Dawntrail story: 2/10 [/h1]Square Enix this is not okay, this is not how a story should be written and with Yoshi'p not having full control of the story writing, the story quality of future expansions and updated will be extremely affected.If this was Daichi's writing of the expansion, im afraid it will gets worse....and this is not forgivable.",1720392062,17,2,negative

Literally entire dlc focused on her, and i dont even find her likeable at all. Childish and repeating same things every dialouge. Did you know she cares about other cultures? Did you know she loves her people? Some may find her good character, but i cant like her at all. I dont wanna see her ever again. I would propably be okay if i werent to see her trought 90% of the entire expansion.As cold as it might sound, i dont really care about other characters than mine own, maybe expect if i really like said character. But i'd prefer it my own character had more screen time and did something impactful rather than standing and watching. This is all my personal thoughts on this, i am the type that likes being main character rather being side character.Voice acting felt... Weird as well. Lifeless in most cases. There were few good ones, like Koana Va was good, but scions and others felt lifeless.About mechanics im neutral. There are some mechanics that are pain in ass, there are some good ones.I didnt liked stormblood much, but at this point i think it i find stormblood more attractive story wise than dawntrail.",1720391552,13,1,negative

It's very clear the FF14 team has went from ""telling a good FF story"" to ""serving their 'shareholder' masters by attempting to indoctrinate impressionable young minds into accepting a brain chipped AI technocracy under multiracial multicultural communism."" It's a good laugh for Noticers, but still remains utterly disgusting as you see just how far downhill the game's going. They even went as far as to make the racial children/natives of the country be the bad guys with completely nonsensical motives just so you would believe ""See? Bloodline and race doesn't matter when it comes to who should rule!"" Meanwhile, Woke Lamat's only drive is ""I want to make my people happy!"" without realizing the people themselves don't know what makes them happy and need a good strong ruler to enforce it for them. It's hilarious and sad at the same time. And none of this is even getting into the terrible things the trans voice actor has done and said on Twitter after working with previous companies. He wasn't hired for his talent, he was hired for his decisions, and it shows. He did a terrible job.

I am not going to mention the VA for Wuk Lamat because that's it's own issue that is barely contributing to the negative feelings I have for this expansion. The story is very padded out and filled with filler. There are no character growths except for Krile and Erenville, both of whom got shafted for the focus on Wuk Lamat. Wuk Lamat has no character growth and no real plot relevance other than being made the ruler of Yok Tural. The biggest flaw with this expansion, more specifically the MSQ, is the pacing. There are times where it gets interesting and you can see the individual threads leading where it could to something greater, but those moments lead to disappointments. I feel as though this should have been two different expansions, one focusing on Yok Tural and the other focusing on the plight of Solution 9 and their queen. I don't mind the job changes as I usually only play healer, but the complaints about jobs like Monk and Astrologian are negligible because it can be changed later in patches. You can't rewrite an entire story in patches, and that's the biggest disappointment considering that the previous expansions, while they may have had their flaws, contained moments of growth and stellar writing.Overall, I have to give this a 3/10. The reason is that while the MSQ was extremely slow and boring, the trials and dungeons were much touched up on and felt fun to run through consecutively. The graphic changes are nice, although I wouldn't have minded if they could have gone bigger with the changes. There's some animation glitches that i've seldom seen, which could also be ironed out with future patches.",1720371234,16,0,negative

Kinda painful. It keeps getting to points where something interesting is going on then it stops and throws you back into the boring stuff again. I've never been the type to skip cutscenes through over a decade of playing, but Dawntrail got me so close multiple times that I just closed the game and did something more interesting.Everything is explicitly explained to you MULTIPLE times, with the supporting characters being so stupid they don't understand what has been literally demonstrated directly in front of them. Paired with the rest of the generic shōnen anime style writing, it feels like this expansion was written for children. I like the new characters, But all the writing around them is kinda awful.I'm really confused why they would write something so simplified and explicitly explained to you, while requiring you to go through several far better written expansions to reach it. Graphics update wise, the first half of the zones are nice looking, but they get progressively more barren and boring after that. I've had to turn most settings down to minimum to be able to run it at a tolerable framerate on my modest 2018-19 machine (which is fair, I guess), especially the amount of characters displayed which they blatantly ignore in multiple cutscenes, forcing me to render crowds that slow my game massively. In fact, amount of characters rendered is the only setting that significantly affects my framerate, which seems like an optimisation issue to me. Every other setting is a minor change. The DLSS seems to help too, though nowhere near as much as everyone seems to insist for other games.Besides throwing fleshy characters into the uncanny valley, I don't personally see much effect in pre-existing areas besides making the shine from rain nicer. After seeing what they'd done to my Miqo'te, I was glad I'd already planned to switch to fem Hrothgar immediately. Seeing my new character in action has honestly been a significant part of what dragged me through this expansion.Fight difficulty has definitely been cranked up significantly in this expansion. Sometimes it's fun, but there have definitely been a few examples of things I just don't understand at all since I don't really have the brain for extreme trials etc, I'm easily overwhelmed and combined with everything else it's draining my motivation to keep playing. I know that's a positive point to a lot of people though, even though there's been more and more content for them over the past few expansions, taking away from what people like myself can actually access.

76561198807585520,0,0,english,"Before playing I was reading reviews and was pretty clear that the story would suck and that most positive reviews were just review bombing and people coping. But I decided to buy and play for the battle content and social aspect any way, it`s a shame I had to support this garbage story to be able to play those.Now to explain how it was reading reviews vs playing: I started the msq deciding to watch the cutscenes and read dialogue, so I could get my own opinion, I already knew that I wouldn't like Wuk Lamat probably, but hey, there are other characters as well and the plot doesn't seem bad on a high level, right? Turns out that yes, the plot isn't bad, I enjoyed some of the early cutscenes and some of the new character introductions and dialogues and I think it would be very possible for this to be an epic adventure despite being the beginning of a new story. But then came the reason why Yawntrail was coined: the stupid pointless quests. It got me to a point that I decided to only watch voiced cutscenes or read cutscenes that would precede some major moments in the story. However, as I played more and more I realized that even those cutscenes were irrelevant, I was flabbergasted that some cutscenes leading out of the early dungeons added LITTLE to NOTHING to the story. I became what I despised for years, a certified cutscene skipper. I literally don't care anymore, I'm in lvl 94 msq, I have some idea of what's going on and I'm looking forward to finishing this crap and watching some youtube summary on the story to catch up.Now to Wuk Lamat. She's not a problem in itself, what makes her insufferable is how the devs decided to show her. They try too hard, and I mean too hard, to make her seem likeable. Most of her interactions feel forced, she's an annoying mary sue that feels unbelieavable most of the time and what's worse: most cutscenes I've watched were like 5-10 mins of her crying and being consolated for something, detracting from what was actually happening in the bigger picture to show us her internal conflict. That in itself isn't the problem when done in moderation (pay attention to this word, moderation), but when you make an entire cast to be just blind emotional supporters to her that offer no solid advice or try to confront her beliefs and show her a new way of thinking, then it stops being about character growth and becomes about trying to get the reader to feel sorry for the character, over and over again. It's nice to be empathetic, but in order to do that we need to relate to the characters and as of now she's completely unrelatable. Her father is cool though, and the other claimants got me more interested in them than in Wuk Lamat, sad, right?Now to the battle content, I've done the two first dungeons and the trial. Much better than EW dungeons and trials so far, I can't point exactly why, but the mechs seem more fun and engaging. I also enjoyed the changes to black mage as I've always been a standard line user, so my life hasn't changed much and it feels good not to need to weave sharpcast all the time. So far I'm interested in trying some other jobs as well and I'm excited for the other dungeons, trials and raids, as well as the glamour. The 2 dyes system is really refreshing but it's so sad that they left raid gear from savages out of it. The last thing I want to talk about is music. Most of the tracks don't seem to fit the aesthetic, they don't bring tribal elements or instruments into the mix, but worst of all: I've played both lvl 91 and 93 dungeons twice so far and... I don't think I remember how the tune goes? The boss music, completely unremarkable as well. Now compare that to Stormblood, Shadowbringers and Endwalker, they have so much more identity and really pop, making the boss battles feel more epic and high stakes. The main theme is good, I like it, but the derived themes and orchestrations don't seem to go the extra mile that the previous expansions went, at least so far. I won't compare to ARR and HW as I don't remember most of those, save for a few tracks.This is my long rant about the game. solid 2/10, but I still play because I know the frustration is temporary. God, how much I missed ARR fetch quests, I had no idea.",1720354897,13,0,negative

Haven't finished story yet, but my main gripe is that story treats players like 6 year olds. Every single thing is explained to you in great detail. Like at one moment before first trial Alisaie was saying ""Even people with wildly different ideals can find understanding through earnest discussion. I believe that wholeheartedly"". This sounds like a corporate statement. No Sass, no character, nothing. Listening to this feels like munching dry and moldy bread. And all MSQ is like that. Characters are one (or even zero) dimensional. New races are bland and uninspired and basically have one defining trait and that's all. World building is lazy. Yes, dungeons and trials are good. Yes graphics update is excellent. Yes, locations look pretty. Yes, new job gear is awesome, but what's the point if you want to unlearn how to read and perform self-assisted lobotomy  just to not experience the story.",1720344869,319,10,negative

Zenos and Yotsuyu ( step on me ) vs Dawntrail lizards and matrix ai ... i think stormblood wins here too.The conclusion of the story was also meh..

To put it bluntly without spoilers, they really make you wanna love Wuk Lamat in this game, when quite frankly she is the worst thing about it. The story is ungodly slow, the pacing is rough, the quests disengage you, and the characters we all know and love kinda take a back seat in this one. Not saying its complete garbage, Viper and Pictomancer are great additions to the classes we already have. The dungeons are great and colorful, music is always on point, and the boss fights are awesome. Its a new expansion so everything that comes with the new content is a welcome addition. This is the one expansion I had to switch over to the JPN voices because the ENG VO for Wuk Lamat is kinda bad. In the more dramatic scenes, her delivery comes across very comical and not serious. The japanese VO makes the story a little bit more enjoyable. If i can group the expansions from Worst to Best it would definitely be: Dawntrail, Stormblood, Endwalker, Heavensward, and Shadowbringers. As a fan, definitely get the expansion as there will be plenty to do. But either skip the MSQ and just go straight to end game, or go in knowing you'll more than likely be disappointed by a lot of things. Best of luck WoL!

The WoL and Scions barely play any part in the story, I don't think much would change if they were completely removed.The new zones are also lackluster. They are not bad by any means, but they feel like remixes of already existing places, like Gridania, Lakeland, and Thanalan, among others. There's no excitement when you enter one of these, it's more of a ""Ah shit, here we go again"".The music is....fine? If anyone asked me to hum a single melody from this expansion, I genuinely could not. But at least it isn't egregiously bad.Battle content like dungeons and trials (no raids are out at the time of writing) are a significant improvement over previous expansions. New, interesting mechanics, and a difficulty increase that seems fair and is satisfying to work with.Overall, the story is a complete miss. Absolutely not worth the time. The vibe of the expansion in general was supposed to be reminiscent of a vacation, but I never got that feeling. It just feels bland, soulless, and pointless.

At least if you did that, you could expand that story into a point of contention that becomes a major plot point - maybe a splinter faction group finds it unfair that only Royalty can maintain their immortality and they want it for themselves (creating a ""de-facto Ascian"" situation where they just keep coming back over and over like the Ascians did after you destroyed their body but not their soul) or they want the practice to end for ethical reasons? What if the plot points becomes that there are too many soul-robots and it's destroying the local environments? What if the soul-robots get hacked and used to take over the world, kinda like how Otis was forcefully commanded by lizardboy?Or, if putting them into robots doesn't work, why not set up ""visitation centers"" where people who want to visit their deceased loved ones can manifest them temporarily and they can do whatever it is they want to do, and then when their time expires, the manifestation gets unmade. Then, your plot point could be that someone really evil managed to escape the ""unmaking"" and steals the technology for visitation centers to continuously print his evil friends and they wreak havoc in Tural?You could have written about any number of justifications for ""the big bad needing to do big bad things"", but the one they went with is just so frail in its construction that I just can't take it seriously. But no, because they went with this really stupid ""problem"", they have to turn it into a ""world-ending"" threat, but the delivery of it all has zero impact.It's like I said in my original review: [b]how can you top Endwalker's ""universe-ending"" threat?[/b] That's a bar they've set and they need some serious time and effort to come up with a story that can meet that bar.I forgot to mention a couple of things in my original review, and there are some other things to address as well:-- No, I do not care about babysitting Wuk Lamat. That has no sway on the review that I gave for Dawntrail. We've done much more mundane and boring things in the past, so babysitting her throughout the expansion was a drop in the bucket. A lot of people seemed to be really annoyed by this, but I didn't mind it at all.-- No, I do not care about the voice acting issues. I play with Japanese Dub + English Sub. Their voice acting was good in the JP dub. However, the translation team really needs to stop taking so many creative liberties with the translation. There were far too many instances where they clearly say a very distinct word/phrase in JP and the English translation says something completely different.-- I am fully aware that the writing team has been given a shakeup ever since Endwalker ended. That does not excuse the fact that somebody approved this story. If it were up to me, I would have pushed back hard and told them to rewrite numerous sections in every phase of Dawntrail. There is far too much room for improvement. This is a classic case of amateur hour being given way too much leeway.-- The class changes are very, very good. Yoshi-P and the balance team have gotten extremely talented at improving ""game feel"" so that rotations and playstyles aren't clunky.-- Not exactly restricted to Dawntrail, but the game has been in need of a change to the player camera for a while now. They should have increased the amount you can zoom out two expansions ago, and that was something I wish that they addressed along with the graphics update. One of the expert dungeons involves tracking an entity that circles around the arena and you have to be far away from it. When there's only one to track, that's not an issue, but tracking two when the camera is so zoomed in and you have a giant enemy covering 20% of the screen, it's very easy to lose track of one or the other, especially with all the visual bloat (even with limited visuals enabled). A wider FOV would also help immensely.==END OF EDIT==This has to be the weakest storytelling I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing for a Final Fantasy game.The first half is pretty good. You're part of a tournament to see who is worthy enough to take the throne. Awesome, that's a great plot point that you can flesh out into a countless number of substories and characterizations.The second half is where they just throw everything out the window and said ""oops, we ended that story arc a bit too quickly, we can't release half an expansion worth of story! fuck it, throw in some cowboys and alien tech.""But what pisses me off the most is that, in the first half of the story, your character is lauded as a hero of legendary status, and for the most part, you show for it. In the second half of the story, your character (and your allies, too) act like a bunch of dimwits who are somehow shellshocked by a single humanoid wearing armor with glowy purple lines. Like, at this point, you've all defeated literal Gods, you've fought with a world-destroying monstrosity at the edge of the universe, but all it takes is one lizard boy to make you freeze up? What in tarnation... who wrote this garbage?? It's the worst way to force a plot point and it's downright insulting to the players.We didn't play through numerous expansions building up this legendary character only to have them act like this.I can keep going on, but for the most part, there are multiple other reviewers who have already pointed out that the expansion is littered with:[code]""This is a field. We grow crops here, in case you didn't know.""[/code]It's just sickening at this point. MadSeasonShow had a very compelling point when it comes to storytelling. Quote:[code]""[...] and that's the problem once again with these 'Marvel-like', grandiose, epic, world-shattering storylines where the player is this ultimate savior and badass of the world - best friends with Khadgar, best friends with Magni - it just doesn't work in an MMO because, not only is it multiplayer - it's hard to be the savior of the world when everyone else is - but... you also paint yourself into a corner because... how do you top that?""[/code]And that exact problem becomes very apparent in Dawntrail. We've saved the universe from the giant space lady. Square Enix now has to acknowledge that your character and their allies are capable of these feats. If they treat them any less, if they act like they are not powerful enough to tackle a challenge of lesser or equal measure, then you're just insulting the player's intelligence. We're not stupid, we know (from both a gameplay perspective, a lore perspective, and a roleplaying perspective) what our character is capable of, and the writers have to respect that much, but they don't do that in Dawntrail.It's compelling to me because this is why One Punch Man is extremely popular. The author of OPM respects Saitama's power. There is no point in that story where the author tries to subvert that claim. The writers for Dawntrail did not share that same respect, and that's what I take issue with.",1720296776,20,0,negative

The dungeons are great. The trials are great. Even the solo instances are decent. They upped the difficulty in a way that feels fair, which was much needed after Endwalker. This is especially true as a healer main who was falling asleep in dungeons because there was nothing for me to do but spam my one attack.[b]Zone design: A-[/b]. Most of the zones are gorgeous and have great atmosphere. I have a few quibbles, like zone 6 being laid out really weird and non-intuitively. There's a controversial thing that happens with zone 6 near the end as well but honestly I respect it from a narrative standpoint.[b]Music: A-[/b]. Down a bit from the heights of Shadowbringers and Endwalker but still very good. A few obvious misses, where you're left wondering ""why is this style of song playing here?"". If you've played through you probably know the ones I'm talking about. Special shoutout to Trial 2's music being an absolute banger.Now I'm gonna split story into a few parts here to more easily explain my issues:[b]Plot narrative: C-[/b]. While it's not *bad* on its face, there are a number of things that happen (or don't happen) that seem to have zero setup or justification. That's not to mention a few major, gaping plot holes. There are also two main plot threads, and they aren't woven together well at all, more just kinda smooshed together.[b]Treatment of major themes: C[/b]. There are some clear major themes in Dawntrail. They are competently touched on, but not explored with any real depth, sans one single cutscene that felt out of place for how poignant it was compared to the rest of the surface-level writing.[b]Pacing: C[/b]. It could be a lot worse, like 2.x, but it could be a lot better. This I think goes back to my complaint about the two main plotlines not being woven together at all, making the whole thing feel a lot more dragged out than it otherwise would have.[b]Voice acting: B-[/b]. The main character's performance is competent if uneven. Some other characters put on great performances, others laughable. The scions for whatever reason sound a bit worse than previous. Dunno what's going on there. There are also some odd choices in terms of what was voiced and what wasn't.[b]Character writing: F-[/b]. The big black mark of the expansion thus far. The scions are utterly lobotimzed into ""we're here for duty support slots"" or at best exposition dumps. The villains have nonsensical motives and change them on a dime. Other scion-adjacent characters who were supposed to get some shine got far too little and had their plotlines rushed. The main character who is ostensibly in a growth arc grows only in confidence and not competence. There are also a number of saturday morning cartoon-level character gags repeated ad nauseum, especially in the first half. This part of the xpac was an unmitigated disaster, and the controversial main character is only a small part of it.So overall, I'm ultimately neutral on this. Why do I then give it a thumbs down? I give it a thumbs down because this is ostensibly a story-first MMO. No other MMO gets as much shine for its story as this game does. While I enjoy the battle content, the crafting/gathering, etc, the story is ultimately what keeps me engaged. The writing seems to be going in a terrible direction, and I feel flipping my review to negative is one small thing I can do to push back against it.",1720295432,466,2,negative

Dawntrail has THE BEST battle content they've ever made and it just started so if you're a story skipper this is the best expansion yet. That being said if you buy FFXIV expansions for the story and adventure you should skip Dawntrail IN MY OPINION.The story is easily the worst they've ever done. Realm Reborn should never be better than any expansion after it but I genuinely think it's better than Dawntrail. I'll keep it brief because there's just too much to whine about.Instead of casually exploring and questing in this new world, seeing it's amazing landscapes and learning the unique cultures first hand you are permanently tethered to Wuk Lamat. Even if you like Wuk Lamat I think this goes against the spirit of the expansion's theme but not a big deal. The problem is Wuk Lamat is poorly voiced/directed (think Gal Gadot in that one scene where she's on the hood of a car yelling at Pedro Pascal), naive, never gets punished for her decisions and never gets a chance to stick to her morals DESPITE the harsh realities of politics, instead politics conform to her. The poor writing couldn't even live up to the most obvious character arc an easily entertained ape like I could think of.The rest of the cast are no better, barely memorable. There are 3 side characters and 2 main characters in the entire story that live up to FFXIV's genuine writing style and pedigree and they get very little screen time before the plot moves on or their arc resolves. I don't mind existing characters being ignored as much as others but when they are included I wish they weren't because it feels contrived and rushed.TLDR: The entire main quest gets hijacked by a polarizing character at the detriment to everything else, including the stated goal of the expansion in marketing, the characters featured in marketing, FFXIV's writing, the feeling of slowly exploring new lands and cultures and even the WoL as a separate entity to the player.

You get done with 1, talk to the next person and yet another cut scene starts. So much is running and talking, fetch quests (Pretty sure we gathered cooking ingredients like 4 or 5 times). Also, the setting changes from Latin America to [spoiler]Old West America to something that looked like it was straight from Kingdom Hearts was jarring[/spoiler]. Story wise, this expansion was a major fail.As for classes, the class changes seem to be pretty decent. Only really leveled Black Mage, but I have touched a few other classes. Pictomancer seems to be interesting and Viper has a lot going on and probably is suffering the same issue as Ninja.Of course, this is just the start of the expansion.

Criticism of the clearly amateur voice acting is met with ""You hate trans people""View the rest of this at your own risk, since they are spoilers, though there isn't even much to spoil to begin with. [Spoiler]If you followed the hype train in any way, your expectations will not be met at all, they dropped the ball HARD with this one. The only good things I can say about this expansion are that the graphics update is pretty, nice QOL changes, new classes are fun, the dungeons are a marked improvement, but other than that everything else is worse. People sub to this game for the MSQ, so if the MSQ is not good then there's not much reason to play this game. FFXIV has good content sure, but if it's all about content only FFXIV is outclassed by many other games like WOW, ESO, GW2, like let's be honest here, FFXIV was never the top dog because of content, it was because of having good content, a good dev team, AND an amazing story which you could follow. [/spoiler][spoiler]The story clearly borders on false advertising, it's advertised as this brand new adventure, where the WOL is competing with his fellow scions for the rite of succession to become Dawnservant. Essentially, the first half is a generic anime tournament arc, but it's done in one of the most laughably awful ways. NONE of the characters are interesting, the three competitors are as follows: Fascist Lizard Guy, Roman Empire Lizard Guy, and Capitalist Mi'qote / industrialist. There is no political intrigue, and it barely delves into any kind of political tension whatsoever. There are no ideological clashes either, and the ""rites"" are the most laughably boring quests i've ever played in an MMO. FFXIV is was never the best with quest design, but my god this is a new low. The rites are ALL exposition dumps, where you are told small details about the village, and about tribes who are honestly not very interesting and lack depth. Every tribe can be described in a single sentence, Pelupelu like trading with people, Hanu Hanu love farming and have a funny dance to regrow reeds, the hroth tribe were at war with mamool ja and made a truce with a food. The Mamool Ja are the only interesting tribe, with the whole blessed sibling plot, and sacrificing children to make a strong sibling to take the throne. Moreover, the rite of succession is worthless, since there is no competition all 3 of the competitors all either get disqualified, or disqualify themselves from the competition. It's just disappointment after disappointment, even when Thancred and Urianger are together, and the game hypes up this competition between you and them, it falls flat and doesn't even give you that. Thancred smashes a tree stopping you from moving further in a dungeon and you instantly find another path. That's the closest thing to competition, the rest of it is just collaborating (which defeats the entire point of this competition). And Finally, what makes the expansion worse is Wuk Lamat herself, the entirety of the expansion revolves around her, she is completely forced onto us and we are supposed to love her. It reads like a cringy self-insert of the author themselves, like Wuk Lamat actually feels like a FFXIV Wattpad fanfiction character, she lacks any depth, she just feels like a generic shonen protagonist (A shonen protagonist in a bad shonen also), we have to babysit her the entire time, she steals all the glory, the WOL doesn't interact with anyone and could just be invisible, and it's just not fun.",1720291793,19,0,negative

She is an uncompelling character and is incredibly forced, even moreso than Minfilia. With Minfilia, Lyse etc, you at least spend time with other characters, but in Dawntrail you cannot get away from Wuk Lamat. Every time you split up, you're paired with her. She's shoehorned into everything. Everyone talks about every situation in relation to her. You're known only for being her attendant. She also hogs the spotlight in every situation, including bosses, and then gets the credit too. It was already bad enough half way through but they will cram her down your throat until you're sick of her and then keep going. The story was crap as is but she just drags it down even further.

We get no adventure and the stakes escalate too high. The WoL serves no purpose in the story: we just cheer Wuk Lamat on and do labour for her. We could easily be deleted along with the Scions, who are there just to make up the numbers when they appear at all. Krile and Erenville get very limited focus and their stories, whilst decent for what little we get, fall flat because Wuk Lamat eats up all the screentime. She has more dialogue than Erenville and all the Scions combined and most of it is just repeating the same crap.

There is nothing fun about talking to 15 NPCs in a row (yes that was an actual quest in the MSQ) and I have no clue why the devs would think otherwise.On a positive note, the dungeons, trials and raids are all very good. Unfortunately, all of this is overshadowed by huge pacing issues, annoying characters and amateurish writing.",1720267917,0,0,negative

76561198260827138,0,0,english,"Spoilers: The content is engaging and fun, the dungeons are some of my favorites in the game currently. The jobs/reworks as well are pretty solid for the most part.          MSQ... After over a decade of world building, Dawntrail forsakes all of that. Now you're no longer the mc, Wuk Lumat who I personally don't dislike as a character, but her narrative takes the leading role and does virtually nothing to show for it. We're coming into Dawntrail after a universe ending threat, with not even a word of acknowledgement, nor does the WoL get any recognition. We & the former Scions do all the work, but get none of the recognition, as it all goes to Wuk Lumat. The pacing is so incredibly slow, the story doesn't feel as if it's started until the end of zone 6, by then you've already sunk 20 hours of fetch quests and babysitting Wuk, just not engaging content and can go literal hours between any fights, even in world. Zone 5 was solid, but it felt as if it needed to be introduced sooner, as well as the characters with it, the story clearly wants you to empathize and get attached to some characters and yet... They're simply too shallow for us to care. Most notably, Queen Sphene, who's written in a way similar to Emet Selch. Had we been given more time to empathize with her and her goals, although her efforts are just prolonging the inevitable, we might be more inclined to care for her. Sadly, it falls short.             Going into zone 6, It's built up to be this jump into the unknown, all the scions barring G'raha and Krile stay behind with the goal of protecting and keeping open the gate, from there on it is never once acknowledged of their efforts to keep it open nor any struggle, meaning it was all pointless. In zone 6 you learn of Krile's past & family, learn that perhaps we've learned our magic from another reflection or potentially somewhere else even in a passing comment from G'raha, and it's never acknowledged again. And finally... Erenville. Following the trope of sadness turning into anger, leading him to pout and act selfish for the entirety of zone 6 with his mother until finally it's her time to pass on. While understandable, it's frustrating and really solidified my disdain for the character.             The final fight, while fun, it fell short narratively. We go to confront sphene, and it's setup in a way not unlike the fight with the Endsinger. Where everyone is cast away but the WoL, and finally.. we're recognized for our strength. Like all major fights seemingly now, we use our scapegoat azem crystal and start the fight. About a third of the way into the fight, a phase transition occurs and magically Wuk Lumat is the only one that was cast away to find a crack and break free, and she proceeds to reach out to Sphene's character and tank the fight for us as the fight is about to end. We finish the fight, it sets up for us potentially to have access to use the gateway to travel into other reflections with the artifact, and then it fades to black and cuts out to us and the scions leaving the temple where the gate is kept. Then pans out into a celebrating Tuliyolall. That's it. That's the story. Compared to Shadowbringers & Endwalker, hell even Stormblood, this msq completely falls flat on its face.              I don't hate Wuk Lumat as a character, but with the scions being neglected, to shallow storytelling and character building for the new characters, as well as her outshining the WoL/MC it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Dawntrail was frustrating.TLDR: Content is engaging, story and world building is trying to start anew but ends up shallow and falls flat on its face, while completely disregarding over a decade of world building and story/characters. Above all, it's just sad to see a game that's brought some of my favorite experiences in gaming fall short on this scale. It feels like being spit in the face. Thanks for coming to my ted talk..

But ultimately, while I tried to go into DT with low expectations, it really fell short for me.Keeping things vague, if you're going into this hoping to hang out with your fellow scions, play a meaningful role in the story, be a leader/guide to the actual main character Wuk Lamat (rather than mostly just being at her side), don't. You won't find it. Your time spent with fellow scions is minimal at best, and the way they are written feels awkward and untrue to themselves. They don't really grow as characters with one sort of exception, and frankly? Neither do you. I feel like I didn't learn anything, like I didn't grow. Wuk Lamat is a sweetheart, but all of the ""lessons"" they're trying to teach are so heavy handed and overdone that I grew resentful of it by the end. The pacing and story focus ruined the pacing of the final zone, as well as the stakes. We didn't need to be told information as explicitly and as often as we did, I felt like I was being babied. Everything up until ~96 was good enough. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. But the final parts were boring and filled with heavy handed story to the point I felt resentment. This expac wasn't just about the strength/meaning behind family, *every* character had *some* tie to family. Every character had stakes in the family pool to the point it felt ridiculous. No matter the stakes, sometimes you were forced to take your time and do silly things, even after having been told how important it is you take care of things quickly. The music is fantastic. The areas are gorgeous. The combat is new and exciting, and the quality of life changes are beyond welcome.

Music, enviroment designs, character designs, dungeons and trials. All were truly amazing. Dungeons/trials difficulty compared to previous expansions was increased for normal story players, but had enough balance to keep them fun.However, sadly all of this greatness is wrapped in poorly written story, which very clearly is divided in 2 halfs. There might be small spoilers, but I will do my best to not spoil anything major. First half, is what I describe as Pokemon babysitter adventure. We go around Tural collecting ""gym badges"" and in essense watch over Lamat. However, its boring, extremly boring. She doesn't grow as a person, instead gets really weird power strikes for the sake of not involving us the player (Someone has to push the story forward, but we cannot do it, we can only stand next to her... idk why, just reasons) and every aspect of the first half is focused on extending the time we spend in the expansion. Even if halfs are relatively even, the first one seems like it will never end, because it literally is that boring, 10h in and you still won't encounter ANY fight.Second half is much more interesting. Story seems more cohesive and actually attempts to involve the player into some action.  While Lamat is still quite prominent part of this half. We at least get some breaks from her, which you have to trust me... It was needed. Overall the second half could stand on its own and in my opinion too much attention was put into first half than the second one.  For me the story ratio should be 30% first half and 70% second half.. but well we got more like 60% first and 40% second. For obvious reasons I won't mention any characters that appear in second half. There happens a lot and got really disappointed when in last Trial Lamat rejoins the fight... even tho VERY CLEARLY, She was ""KICKED OUT"" and they never explained how she was able to do it... I guess sheer power of will can override ""Code""Overall I would rate the first half as 3/10. Really boring and uninspired piece of writting. While second half as 6/10 or even 7/10. Scions for once were totally useless.. but THEY HAD TO, include them. Like ALL OF THEM. We didn't need them, they didn't do that much and they feel extremly forced into this expanion...

Firstly, the core of the game has more or less been unchanged for the last 10 years. If you look at low level dungeons vs high level dungeon there is virtually no difference besides different skin mobs; you will always do wall to wall pulls and same rotation. Jobs are disappointing without end, get ready for your job to be butchered and made easier every expansion and complexity is out the window. Viper is a job that was released on this expansion, which is essentially the easiest melee job in the game. For a single target rotation with a few side buttons on a mouse you could most definitely play it with mouse only and one hand. Well, due to a minority complaining over the ""busyness"" of the class steps will be taken to make the easiest melee class even easier - as per their announcement on Lodestone. Story. The story is ok for a Final Fantasy story, however, it feels like 50% of the story is actual story while the other 50% are just fillers. I understand that this is supposed to have a vacation feeling, and I acknowledge that and enjoy that, however, the number of quests that are completely unnecessary are too many. They are also afraid of taking risks with the story and they are going with the tried and tested final fantasy story. Basically the usual friendship thing. Shadowbringers was a success because it did not have much of that, and it felt like there were stakes.While cinematic quality has greatly improved, it does feel like they are needlessly dragged on by lets say showing off the characters walking away while fading out on basically nearly every cinematic of which there are a lot. Or just zooming in on the characters faces while they have their neutral expression on... One by one... of which there are usually more than 6 characters.

However it genuinely blows my mind that there have been so many other characters introduced and were done well, some better some worse, but... this? Library voice when shouting is needed. Flat when emotional despair is needed. Plain when fighting for your life is needed. Disinterested when nervousness, insecurity, and a little trembling is needed.What happened?My theories:1 - The voice acting directory failed to inform the voice actor what to do or the voice actor couldn't deliver/isn't experienced enough, which I highly doubt it otherwise the director would have done something about it. 2 - That or the director couldn't do anything about it because HR refused to find someone else.3 - The person above the voice acting director said you'll work with what you got.I don't know and I don't care. Don't get me started on the useless drivel that is the drama surrounding the VA irl. I discovered it after I had my opinion formed and I wish I could bleach my eyes from all the childish nonsense I bore witness to. All I know is that the ENG voice actor seriously kills everything, yes, up to the point of impacting the delivery of the story. People are comfortable enough to voice it in game that's how bad it is, which has never happened during my time since ARR.

Erenville's growth is probably the only satisfying one.-- ENG va is poor. Performance of the past is what I expected, but it's stiff all around, wuk lamat isn't the only one with problems but she is the worst of the bunch.-- Music is a delight but, that's subjective of course. Two of them seriously reminds me of megaman and kingdom hearts 2.-- Zones are a treat for the eyes.-- The Lore drops a TON of threads for the team to pull from and for fans to theory craft (2nd phase of the story though. 1st one has nothing). -- Speak to Wuk Lamat. Accept Wuk Lamat. Be with Wuk Lamat. Become Wuk Lamat. -- You will get the Ishikawa emotional damage moments but there's a lot less here so temper expectations significantly.

It has the vibes of an anime series that got popular, got to the end of the manga story but the execs wanted more money so they make up some  nonsensical elongated plot  to keep money coming in.I hope that the writers can turn it around but it feel like they wrote themselves into a corner, or had half the script written by chatGPTThe game visually is pretty but the 2.5 of the latter dungeons and visually very similar with vary little variation Mechanics are fun and challenging. Usually i would jump into extremes but this story has burned me so bad I can't even bring myself to do roulette's through fear of getting the new content and  being reminded of how garbo this expac has been.I wish i had never bought DT. cos at least then i could have happily still done roulette's with friends.Shame a story can't be patched.If you are someone who plays for the content grab the game. if you play for the story, and particularly if you are a fan of ff9. Don't. Wait for it to be on sale, or see what word of mouth is on the patch content.",1720217506,16,1,negative

Build up all that excitement and sneak peaks for the new expansion just to put on my reading glasses on minute one. Annoying, but this is still the least annoying aspect of the expansion for me.My main complaint, Wuk Lamat. Yes I am aware of all the drama going around, but this is not related to it. What is annoying is that the writing of this character. At first it was a cute and interesting journey but oh boy did she become annoying quick. During all of the trials, we and rest of the scions that carried her. She has no outstanding power compared to anyone in the scions yet she gets to be the front ""power"" during the second half of the expansion? Sphene's intention was to devour whole Eorzea, not just Tuliyollal. Lets drag a lion pup with us into battles and act like she is capable of holding herself and give the microphone during the few voiced scenes. With that here comes my second major complaint. Who guided this VA during their performance? A carrot? There was NO emotion, struggle, grunt, or a single tone change during the battle with Sphene from Yap Lamat. SHE GOT CRUSHED BY A GIANT ROBOT HAND AND SHE SAYS ""sphene"" as plain as it gets. Really? A game that was praised for its story, killed one its good aspects, during the climax of the expansion, with that.. sphene. sphene.. stop it.This is a game that I put thousands of hours into it, and compared to every other expansion, this aint it.",1720212534,19,0,negative

After the subpar patch story I already went into this expansion's MSQ with somewhat low expectations but this was not subpar, the writing was just straight up awful.They promised adventure, vacation and friendly competition with your companions and you get nothing of that. You are chained to Wuk Lamat at virtually all times to complete the success ritual and to ""learn about the people of her continent"", but you better don't expect any of the moving, personal character stories of past expansions a'la Inn at Journey's Head or Garlemald - Dawntrail has nothing of that. In praxis you are solving every minor inconveniences for the useless princess until she goes ""Yay, the power of peace and friendship"" and then you literally solve the region's generation-long blight with a single link pearl call. And this keeps happening at a completely predictable and excruciatingly slow pace where you sometimes not see any combat for hours - not even regular trash mobs- and there is nothing even close to memorable solo missions like Endwalker's Thancred infiltration or In From The Cold.  The ""villians"" are also a complete joke, they are  saturday-noon cartoon level evil with complete nonsensical motivations and the only reason the plot advances at all is because the WoL just watches while they go on with their antics. And after that joke of an arc was over (at level 86) they have the audacity to throw in an entire area disconnected from the plot for padding - but it's the only time in the entire game where you get a break from Wuk Lamat so that's an upside I guess.But the thing that agitates me the most is the fact that there *is* great writing in there, it's just completely undercooked and jammed together in the final area. The Golden City itself  is an incredibly fascinating premise and it would have been awesome to spend more time with it's inhabitans and explore the ethics of their situation - this is where they easily could've told some absolutely heart crushing stories and better develop their main villain. Instead the entire ending felt incredibly shoehorned in and rushed and it felt like they had a checklist of things they need to get over quickly. I mean we spent more time on a damn taco recipe than we did in the resolution of the biggest character arc of a companion that was with us since 2.0, it's just unacceptable. *This* should've been the core of the expansion and easily deserved 2-3 more areas that were instead used in that padded garbage succession arc and it just felt like a slap in the face.At least the duties are good, I guess",1720207817,13,1,negative

This has nothing to do with the story having a ""slow start"" or being more ""low-stakes,"" it has nothing to do with ""wanting another Endwalker/Shadowbringers,"" and it has nothing to do with Wuk Lamat, who in my opinion was likeable enough. It's that it is meandering. It's that everyone is saying something, but no one is saying [i]anything[/i]. It's that it is filled to brimming with tired tropes that I thought this story was above using. It's that several mainstay characters are left with nothing of value to contribute to this exciting new chapter in the story, included almost solely to prop up new characters that are just plain uninteresting and flat. It's that every time it reaches a peak, and it starts to actually get some intrigue going, it drops the ball for several hours afterwards.It's disappointing, too, because everything else is [i]fantastic[/i].

The most egregious example being the final questline in the first half of the game where we literally convince a people to stop silently enduring a 400 year long stillbirth holocaust by telling them to just go plant some rice or some shit instead. Ultimately I think the ARR beast tribes, especially the Sahagin and Kobold relationships with Limsa Lominsa were more interesting.Wuk Lamat is fine at the start but quickly becomes a Shonen Protagonist one trick pony that never stops talking. If you're not into anime, I don't imagine you'd like her. Her voice performance is also not the best, with her constantly sounding the same and basically yelling in lower case at hype moments.The whole expansion culminates in what is essentially Shadowbringers 2.0 but much, much worse.The shining beacon of the expansion is by far the dungeons, trials and solo duties. They have all been incredible, with mechanics that actually require a bit of though and damage numbers that have consequences for messing up.Overall I wouldn't no recommend Dawntrail until much later in the expansion when more combat content has been released.",1720204714,20,2,negative

76561198000400799,1932722,18974,english,"So time to review thisIf you read it all, the expansion is quite lengthy. Took me 3 days of just MSQ Reading / Cutscenes.(Includes making my own food, job, etc. like 4-6 hr sessions so in total probably like 15-20 hrs)The Good.The music this expansion is godly, its so damn good.Mechanics so far for dungeons and extremes are really good too.The Bad.- The Graphical Update is a mess, so many bugs for your WOL when it comes to lighting and even textures, you can see seams on your neck, eyes can be off, the graphical update has made it worse for a lot of players if suffer eye straining issues. Honestly what this feels like after seeing it all, I have no proof of AI being used to upscale their textures but it very much feels like this with so many issues within the gear, skin, eyes.Quality of game 3 | 10- Tons of exploits on the maps for the new zones, like zero QA. There are even missing textures in certain areas.- PS5's are crashing when playing the game on 60 FPS | The only fix for them is to literally turn the games graphics down to 30 FPS a console should not be overheating, they even overheat with a deep and thorough cleaning. Xbox players literally could not play the game when transitioning between areas, its really bad. People who own 3080's even struggle to run the game. You also can't turn off bloom which is causing people to get headaches.- The Story is a slog in the beginning which is okay to me since it's a brand new story we need world building sure, but it isn't very engaging for a lot of players which I find is true. Players need substance to be more engage other than just text and cutscenes.- Spoilers on story below -- The story has so many unanswered questions that are essential to the world building, where they could have fleshed out more. Like this could have been the good filler instead of the beginning world filler honestly. Instead you literally have to remind Wuk Lamat what her ""purpose"" in life is several times when its like dude, how many times we have to tell you to believe in yourself, and believe in peace. I understand maybe once or twice sure but shes asked this so many times... Then the plot changes REALLY FAST like beyond fast, the narrative is very jarring and semi-confusing on what exactly happened. When half the story and of purpose was to help Wuk Lamat become Dawnservant which is fine. After we help her become this she has to follow us after to help her nation, when in reality she should have just been left behind to defend her own country with her brother and just have the WoL + Eren + Krile for the rest of the expansion Wuk Lamat did not have to come with us on this added adventure her purpose for the narrative should of been to just become their leader and that's it. Literally she kept self inserting herself into OUR adventure. I understand her Father dies and her Brother does want her to Duel him, to prove herself and to prove himself to be a better ruler, but still after this duel her story should of ended. The Scions literally showed up as well, and did really nothing for the story, they had zero personality traits to them, while on the hand other Einstein literally was a chad the entire adventure and had a more epic adventure. The last 3 zones of the story are really good, until of course Wuk Lamat, literally cannot leave the WoL's sight for even a minute. To even bring it all together the last zone is very good, can be very emotional, sure but it is a kinda cheap cry out scene I agree, but honestly it really is an Amaurot 2.0. It is absurd to force narrative on people to cooperate, find peace, and settle their differences when, literally everything we learned and did means nothing. Wuk Lamat can understand that things aren't always the way they are, but it really felt like she didn't learn anything at all. She even comes back into the Finale, ruining the last boss encounter. - Overall Story Score is a 3 | 10Honestly ARR was better than this.

Trials may have had the most improvement, and have interesting visual tells for almost every mechanic. The team has very clearly found how hectic they want fights to be, as the pace remained fairly consistent since the first trial, including dungeon bosses. -MOST of the job changes and improvements have been nice (I'm so sorry monk players you didn't deserve what happened to you) and visually the abilities have all been pretty solid. Specific praise to the tank mitigation upgrades, it lends more identity to each, and is a correct step towards job individuality. In terms of new jobs, Pictomancer is outstanding, and has a nice depth where your ability to find downtime in a fight is rewarded. It will be a favorite for high level play. Viper is very simple, but fun. It will (probably) be one of the most popular jobs in the game much like summoner. Only concern for Viper is that higher ping players may not enjoy it as they feel they are missing inputs.-Music has been pretty alright compared to other dlcs, the only real standouts were one of the town themes (night), two dungeons near the end of the dlc, and one boss theme. The raids have yet to be released, so this one is subject to have positive additions.-And finally the controversial character, Wuk Lamat. Putting aside all politics, she is not well written at all. She is a gimmick character that they gave a full story for. If you like that, power to you. Personally I believe she is very one note, and hope shes a one-and-done dlc character. Probably going to get put on a stake for it but I feel its enough of a talking point that it needs to be mentioned, as she is a MAJOR part of this dlc, if not the entire thing.-This is a good stepping stone, but this is not a good dlc.

When the story does seem like it's going to start picking up, it will instead drag its pace to a halt to focus on boring, minute details that serve no purpose other than padding the story to be longer than it needed to be, and this occurs right up until the end of the final zone. I am totally fine with a slower paced story and was not expecting something like Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but there is a difference between slower paced and completely devoid of anything interesting happeningThe game design in the main scenario needs serious work as well, the excessive amount of cutscenes and lack of any meaningful gameplay for the majority of it; needs to be heavily rethought. It was an issue in Endwalker as well but it is somehow even worse here. The quest design is borderline visual novel at this point.The two new jobs are cool additions, but the overall job design still continues to suffer from being overly simplistic. On the plus side, the dungeons and trials in the expansion are some of the best in a long time and definitely a big step up from Endwalker. The zones are also very nice visually and the graphical update is a big improvement that really allows these new zones to shine.Whilst I am hopeful that the post-launch content will be able continue the high quality standard that the dungeons and trials offer at launch, at the moment I can't recommend the expansion based on it having such a severely lackluster story which is the primary draw that the game focuses on.",1720196486,15,0,negative

It feels like things/plans/topics were talked over way longer than they needed to be or just straight up repeated multiple times in the dialog. There were no new types of quests, just the standard cookie cutter ""talk to x,z,y and gather their opinions"" and maybe a tracking/tailing quest that didn't even throw any hooks (no double back, no trailed person trying to catch you out, they all followed linear paths and turned around once or twice and that was it.) Next while the story had a clear goal with Wuk Lamat from 90-95 it felt like afterwards the writers were floundering around with the story all the way to the last zone... which they butchered *for* the story. This was compounded on the fact there was very little combat besides the new dungeons, I think I killed less than 50 enemies in the new zones thru the entire Dawntrail campaign. I went back and checked thru voice/unvoiced cut scenes and you can have a pretty good understanding of Dawntrail campaign even with skipping unvoiced cut scenes and saving yourself some time.I also had gripes about the content of the story, for example with Erenville. Some parts of how his story was written and he just feels like an emotionless c*nt when I know he can be so much better (trying not to go into spoilers).On a more positive notes, the zones are lovely and the new extreme trials were a good challenge to progress thru.

Obviously story beats and content quality ebb and flow. But my fucking god was Wuk Lamat really the best they could come up with? SE spent ten years telling us that WoL and friends are the main characters and then decided to shovel a shitty anime protagonist in our faces and have us just go along with it. Wuk Lamat was enjoyable enough for me when she was in her element and it was her right to be over-the-top and childish, but as soon as we left her element and her story she doubled down on her insufferable attitude.Most of the characters that we have spent years getting to know and have come to appreciate, or at least tolerate, were only around for a scene or two. The bonds we as the player may or may not have built with them were legitimately ignored for Wuk Lamat's ham-fisted attempts at being our new best friend. And aside from a short jaunt into the desert for half a zone, she is in every. single. cutscene. All of them. Did I mention she tries so hard to be our new bff? Spoiler: She knows us for what feels like an entire week before declaring us family Vin Diesel style and asking us to stop doing the thing we've been doing since this game began.Wuk Lamat is the literal main character of Dawntrail. Not you, the player, which would be fine if she didn't get on so many players nerves. Go look at any FFXIV community and you'll see discourse about her. This isn't a case of 'people not engaging with the story' or being bigots (way to go EN for looking dumb). This is a case of people not liking a middling-ass character taking center stage. Remember Lyse? Remember how divisive she was? Remember how quick she went away?Pepperidge Farm remembers.Gameplay content on release has been amazing from my experience, excited for the raid tier and literally any other content that isn't the main story. I'm still paying my sub and playing with my friends because most of the next 2.5 years I'm going to spend in instances with said friends. I'm still leaving a negative review because the MSQ is a core aspect of this game.

76561198288504559,0,0,english,"(7000+ hrs of game play logged total of FFXIV)I do like this expansion but I have a few concerns that stop me from giving it the thumbs up. Read below.Review subject to change* (long but just bear with me)  -Plot stuff (no spoilers don't worry): I agree with most of the other reviews saying the pacing is very slow at the start especially. It is arguably not as bad as other expansions but still not the best in this regard. There really isn't much of a hook at the start to keep you interested but it does need to exist for character development down the road (later). The pacing issue is not just a Dawntrail thing, it happened in Endwalker, A Realm Reborn and most notably in Stormblood as well. It's an ongoing issue.  The story itself is fine. That's the best way to put it, its fine. Its not bad, just okay.- 90-100 Role QuestsThe new level 100 role quests however are extremely hit or miss depending on the one you do. Most of these quest are not enjoyable to play through. Only one of the quests had kept me interested but that isn't a great ratio.(played through all but one) -Characters: The new characters are fun. There are a few times were the characters did some things that didn't really make sense/didn't act when they should have to be believable but its not a huge problem.We do feel like a babysitter sometimes but that's kind of the point. We are bodyguards, not this story's main character. Some players may not take well to having so little impact in the story yet and that shows in some other reviews. And that's perfectly fine. Player characters have been the focus for so long it’s bound to ruffle feathers when they aren't anymore. And some may not enjoy the change that we have gotten to the style of story being told now.  -Antagonists: Without saying too much; they kind of feel like high school bullies rather than threats at the start, and the story has no real weight because of it. There isn't an obvious or reasonable need for our character to be there bar being a guard dog (changes later), and that makes it hard to form an attachment or sense of purpose for the player to be drawn into the story. (not referring to our playable character) This changes later but the start of the expansion is slow as a result. Things intensify way too late in the story and the threat isn't even really treated as a threat near the end. You get very mixed signals from this expansion. -The game play: So far, I am having a really good time with the actual interactive content (dungeons etc.) they are fun and engaging but a portion of the gear that drops as loot in the dungeons and/ or trade-able gear is recolours of old gear from past expansions. The dungeons are very spread out as well which means it takes quite a while to get to them. Recolours in and of themselves aren't a bad thing when done in small amounts, but there are very few *new* gear pieces that have been created for the expansion. It's almost all recoloured (so far). Previous expansions had nearly all unique gear for just about everything. Dawntrail does not continue that trend.  I love the difficulty increase in normal content as an experienced player but I have seen a fair few players struggle a little while getting used to it. - Daily ContentHowever... I'm not enjoying doing dailies (daily roulette's) as they took out the lvl 90 and Expert dungeon roulette's (expert added back in after completion), which means its extremely rare to even get to play your favourite classes at the higher levels because the majority of the content is extremely low level dungeons and trails that appear the most frequently. So day to day play has taken a hit in enjoyably for more experienced players.Having both expert and level 90 roulette separate was not great but just lumping those higher  level dungeons and trials into the same roulette with level 51+ content honestly is worse.Merging them means that daily content is quicker to complete though which is important for players that have less time to play everyday, which is good.  - Environments: Music= great Areas= beautiful  This is a part of the review that I felt I had to change a significant amount after reaching the second hub city of Dawntrail (Solution 9). Im noticing a growing trend of the environment team for finalfantsy14 making these stunning places and towns but then leaving them empty. (very little actual reason to go there due to a lack of market board for major cities more specifically Solution 9 or just NPCs to talk to or just see walking around).  Solution 9 is the biggest example of this. It has a massive map to traverse but no real reason to. The only place that has a purpose is the scrip exchange area. The rest of the zones are either completely empty with basically no NPCs (interactable or otherwise) or have a few NPCs dotted around but none have any sort of purpose. It doesn't feel like a bustling city, it feels like an empty shell.  Something so stunning being so empty and lifeless was a real shock to me.  The second “hub zone/city” in Shadowbringers; Eulmore seems to be built on the same principle as Solution 9 with market boards and stuff like that so perhaps it's intentional. ?  Tulliyollal was much the opposite, having a smaller map most of the spot's players need/can use are center stage and the rest of the area is small and fun to traverse even if there is no reason to. (would have loved more than one market board but that's personal preference) It feels more alive than its counterpart.    - Graphical Update:  The developers did a great job with the update; the lighting and effects look wonderful. The character updates are hit or miss depending on the person in question that you ask but they are never problematic and can be solved easily due to the developers giving you a way to change your character for free if you don't like the changes to your character. - New Classes:Viper got changed almost immediately after i got it to max lvl. They ruined the jobs fun factor after the changes because people were complaining about its difficulty. They took the *poison* out of the snake(viper)class? They effectively took the only thing in the jobs kit that made it interesting (it was a buff you had to keep up, similar to a DOT); now its a ""click button when flash"" class. I'm glad i got to play it while it was still fun at least but other players have lost that chance.Pictomancer is a really fun class, its dmg is crazy, especially for a class that's made for a more fun loving clientele. Its novelty fell off fairly quickly for me but I'm sure a lot of players still love that the job exists. Square certainly does as it is still yet to be nerfed as of the edit to this review. - Conclusion: Its hard to give a full review right now and most of this is subject to change but I do recommend the expansion so far.  I just feel like the quality isn't there right now. In a way it feels a little bit rushed. Things could (as always) have been paced better and refined more. This expansion heavily focuses on wowing the player base with visuals but not much else as of right now.  I genuinely believe that the lack of new/interesting gear is a large downgrade from previous expansions as of right now. I still love the game and its player base, I only voted no as most of my thoughts on the matter right now are mostly of mild concern rather than positive.   As always, please go and play through it for yourself and formulate your own opinions. Stay safe and happy gaming.",1720181092,4,2,negative

Instead, we're given a series of predictable events and bland dialogue that do little to engage the player. The new characters introduced in Dawntrail are forgettable at best, and their motivations are either clichéd or poorly explained.The pacing is another major issue. Key moments that should be thrilling or emotionally charged fall flat due to poor execution and a lack of build-up. The quests are repetitive, making the already tedious story feel like a chore to slog through. Even the cutscenes, which have often been a highlight in previous expansions, seem overly long and filled with needless exposition.In short, the Dawntrail expansion's story is a significant letdown. It's a tedious, uninspired mess that struggles to maintain interest, much less excitement. For an MMO known for its rich storytelling, this latest chapter is a regrettable stumble.

For the parts that I could tolerate so far in this expansion, the primary focus is this boring, bland, and not even appealing-to-look-at character whose voice feels like someone took a dentist drill to my ears. Everything in this character's story is predictable and honestly fits into your average old Tumblr (yeah, going way back) fanfiction writer with daddy issues. I've barely begun the expansion and am being told, ""she grows on you,"" but the further I progress, it's more like a bloody tumor than a quirky bipedal cat creature.I see attempts at counterarguments being ""You are just mad that your character is not the main focus or main character blah blah blah blah blah,"" which puzzles me. Even in Stormblood, you weren't sidelined when a lot of the focus was on Lyse. I don't understand this terrible attempt at a counterpoint. One of the reasons I hated WoW was that your character was pretty much nameless; in cutscenes, you weren't even there. You were part of ""a group of adventurers."" What drew me to Final Fantasy was that the character you created was a focal point of the world. I didn't feel like I was just playing an MMO.With this expansion, I have the same feeling that I had when I played WoW. Your character is being relegated to support in a subpar story for an awful character whose terrible VA cannot display emotion outside of sadness and crying properly while doing a fake accent.(Seriously, listen to when the character tries to display ""Anger""; I honestly thought I was listening to ARR voice acting for a bit there.)Why wouldn't I want this character that is my character in an RPG, ""ahem,"" let me say that again, an RPG, to be part of the main focal point of the story? That's all I got for now; it's just so boring storywise and lacks any of the same wonder that post-ARR expansions had. It's not just because it's an entirely new arc; it's genuinely bad, in my opinion.Side Note: There is nothing in this expansion that fits into, ugh, the blanket word that essentially means nothing, ""woke.""

She's the main character and you're there to follow her, it's her story and you better get used to it cause 34 out of 100 quests are given by her. A majority of quest objectives go ""Talk to Wuk Lamat. Talk to Wuk Lamat again."" You get one region without her and as someone who doesn't like her it was by far the most enjoyable because it felt like you were finally getting to adventure yourself.Now for the spoilers:Good:- Each environment was beautifully designed, it was great to ride around in.- Music for the last few zones were great. End credits didn't really fit but neither does this expansion- New jobs are fun, Pictomancer especially for me- Armor sets given to you during the story all look great aside from the last one which is a recolored Ironworks gearBad:- Solution 9 was shown early on and should have been a surprise. Also the plot of the ""Scions being against each other"" is bullshit cause Koana and Wuk Lamat work together most of the time anyway- Rides or dies based on how you feel about Wuk Lamat, she's basically Steven Universe where she loves everyone and tries to use the power of love to make everyone get along. Her ""growth"" is going from a royal kid that loves everyone to a ruler that now understands why she loves everyone. Voice didn't fit for me but that's always assumed to be a voice director problem i.e. Riku in Kingdom Hearts 3- Story was painfully predictable. Wuk Lamat would become leader but need Koana to be ""resolve and Reason"" like their dad, the cheating Bakool Ja Ja actually has a sad backstory and thats why he's cheating, the warmongering Zarool Ja goes evil when he loses and becomes the antagonist for like 5 hours and then Sphene who you just met but not actually Sphene because she's technically just an AI and who cares at this point- You will watch this expansion more than you will play it, it's safest to assume each time you talk to an NPC you're getting a cutscene and it doesn't matter if you just got out of a cutscene. Most of which have Wuk Lamat preaching at you or giving a speech about how much she loves her people. Just skip them cause you'll already know whats happening- Dungeons are formulaic now, 2 packs of 2-4 mobs followed by a mini boss twice, then 2 packs of 2-4 mobs followed by the final boss. Only actually interesting thing are the environments and learning what the bosses do- Ignoring the fact the final area is yet again an area for specifically the memories of the dead (The Tempest, Ultima Thule, and now the lazily named Living Memory) the entire story of it is pointless. You're there to shut down terminals that kill off The Endless, so instead of just getting it over with Wuk Lamat decides for everyone that you all need to listen to The Endless and help them to understand why Sphene loves them so much. Then after that you kill The Endless in that area and go onto the next. Stupid.Ultimately I think it's the worst expansion, I think if it just cut out Wuk Lamat's rite shit entirely and gave more focus to Sphene trying to preserve her people then the expansion would have been more enjoyable and a lot shorter.

So much of it doesn't matter and feels like filler to get to the last part, where there's some excitement.  There are so few memorable characters and/or places (again, until the last part).  Everything feels inconsequential, the WoL doesn't need to be here, we're just being dragged along, watching very boring things play out. Lazy trope after lazy trope... the conveniences and contrived dialogue/events were so hard to get through.You can tell there were a few moments where they wanted the player to feel something, emotion, happiness, excitement... but I felt *nothing* during most of this story.  You can't introduce someone to me 5 minutes prior and expect me to care about them.  I understand this is a new story being told, but it feels like almost none of this is ever going to matter again after this expansion.The dungeons and trials were good.  There were some fun new mechanics.  The jobs feel fun, new skills/spells seem fun.Graphics update is nice, it does look good.The message of the game feels very hamfisted, they *really* are trying to shove it down your throat throughout the entire MSQ.  The message isn't *bad*, it just could have been told through two or three quests instead of the *entire MSQ*.The new zones feel like a lot of work went into designing them, and with how big they are... it's unfortunate that so much of it will probably not be visited again all that much.  Especially later zones... which are very unique, very interesting.The trailer was misleading with how it made you feel some characters would be around more, and the choice of narrator was awful.

76561198022426094,0,0,english,"Not going into the subjective aspects of whether or not the story is any good, there's an extremely core issue hindering this expansion and FFXIV in general at this point.The MSQ questing design is in desperate need of innovation. There is nothing engaging about talking back and forth between  5 NPCs to get information that could have been summed up in one conversation. There is nothing engaging about going around right clicking on a banana peel on the ground and then going back to once again talk to an NPC. It is neither good storytelling nor good gameplay.It is not a valid argument to say that this is okay because every expansion has done it the same way. If there is no improvement to how something is done over the course of a literal decade, that is not okay. It is just laziness or a reluctance to innovate.For example, without going into spoilers, there is a segment of the game where it is the group's task to cook a special dish. We do not do anything for this except go around talking to NPCs. We have dozens of cooking animations because Culinarian is a class that exists. We could have easily had a mini game to cook the dish in this scenario. Instead, we have nothing interesting to do as usual.There are countless moments in the story where literally anything interactive could have been implemented, but instead you just talk to NPCs. The MSQ feels more like a visual novel than a video game.The dungeon and trial design has improved since the last expansion, but there is an ungodly amount of tedium in between content like this. It is a shame, because the zones are nice and the music is good too. But it is unfortunately spoiled by very badly done questing design.Class design is also not great at the moment. Healers are still just one button spam rotation, and the dev team seems to pander to the lowest common denominator on changes in general. Viper has been out for only a few days and most players have already found it be overall very easy to play.

Honestly, every time this character appeared on screen, I felt an urge to skip the scene; she's in 90% of the scenes, making it very painful to follow the story. Not only did this awful character's presence make it difficult to engage, but more than half of the scenes and quests could be cut without anyone noticing.

Perhaps it's because my character isn't caught up on the Dawntrail story itself yet, but thanks to this thing called Youtube and people called Streamers, I know what happens already. Henceforth, I am still qualified to talk about the quality of the gameplay and narrative.This will be long, but I'm trying to paint as accurate a picture of what's going on with this expansion as possible so people can make an informed decision if this is the sort of thing they want to support with their money.I LOVED FFXIV, I really did. I was always huge into the lore, and loved the combat... until both story consistency AND combat content started jumping the shark at the end of Stormblood. As someone else previously posted:""This expansion is a culmination of the FFXIV Community constantly censoring or bulling those with dissenting opinions and the and overworked understaffed Dev team.""Let's start with the combat:Combat used to be fun. Now it has been simplified into the ground, to the point of being the opposite of fun. Combat now has hand-holding. I'm no ""try-hard,"" but all the jobs have now been neutered into the ground. The worst part? The dev team DOES NOT listen, hasn't in years, does the exact opposite of what is recommended to them in feedback, and at this point has resorted to outright making things up.Viper - the new melee DPS job - has been hailed by many as being very fun. It's like what Monk used to be, back in Stormblood, but streamlined (Monk might as well have been thrown into a wood-chipper with how mauled and un-fun it is right now). Literally no one has a problem with it, and it's getting praised by people who normally wouldn't play a job like that. Earlier today, the dev team announced that there were complaints regarding its positional requirements (it literally has very few and is super simple), which nobody can verify the existence of since it seems to be universally loved. Both the NA and JP forums are on fire right now begging SE to not go through with further simplification as it'll kill what is really the only fun melee job left in the game.Mind you, the expansion hasn't been out for even a week at the time of me writing this. Less than a week if you got in via early access, literally TWO DAYS for everyone else. NONE of those people have the job at max level with all the skills unlocked, so they don't even know what the rotation properly looks like. Monk mains begged and pleaded for several expansions straight to reverse course on the direction they took it in, had to wait until literally the end of the expansion cycle when it was too late anyway, and all that happened was it kept getting neutered each time when the salient complaint was ""they took away too much, put all that stuff back!"". But this thing has been officially out for all of two days and you're telling me that these complaints NOBODY can seem to verify are forcing them to take immediate action in the very next patch update, even though EVERYBODY is telling them ""No, no, for the love of God please don't do this""?!They won't listen. They never do. The combat you like will continue to get neutered worse and worse because they don't know what to do with the jobs. At this point, it might as well just be a visual novel with no combat at all. People are now starting to wake up to ""accessibility claims"" not actually being about making the jobs approachable, but to try and omit as much combat as possible for people who want to watch the story like an interactive drama. There's only one problem with that in Dawntrail...... the story this time around is terrible, and the apologists for past expansions no longer have that shield to hide behind. Combat is really the only saving grace to the game now, but outside of Viper's current, soon-to-be-further-simplified state, the gross majority of the playable jobs don't measure up to what they used to be back in Stormblood, which was the ideal state for most jobs in the game. Here's the Story part of my review:Back in Endwalker, they botched the conclusion to the story they were building up for a decade for no good reason, and didn't really set up for where they are going next. A lot of good lore built up around Heavensward and Stormblood completely thrown under a bus by bad, inconsistent writers who can't keep the story straight anymore, and wrote scenes like they were finishing each other's sentences but weren't in the same room as one another. The actual plot and words coming out of characters' mouths were ignored by cry-bullies who had the ""Yoshi-P can do no wrong and all who oppose him must be aggressively silenced"" attitude, because they could fall back on ""the feels,"". After Shadowbringers, the writers felt like they could get away with this and started pushing the envelope to see what they could do, and they pushed it too far with how the main saga of the game ended, making the cracks in the writing a lot more obvious to most people who enjoy the game for its story and actually pay attention to the lore that was touted to be oh-so-amazing. Most of them don't actually know the lore as well as they think they do, but the writing flaws were so obvious that even they were like ""what the hell is even this?"" and it was incredibly divisive. In spite of this, some people still held onto the idea that it was an alright expansion. But now, Dawntrail comes out, and the story... well... what this tries to pass off as ""story"" is downright too tedious and boring for the first half, and then toward the end it just winds up being a bad ripoff of the Shadowbringers plot for no good reason.We've been down this route before with this dev team. For all certain people in the community love to act like it's a small group of try-hards complaining... it isn't. Yoshi-P has been ludicrously out of touch with the players for years, and now that the game is winding down (there are at most two expansions left after this, given the number of job stone slots still available and the engine is so old at this point, creating development bottlenecks), it seems like the big grand adventure we were all so invested in went out with a whimper instead of a bang, and the problem is poor leadership. At this point, unless 90% of the current staff is fired and Naoki Yoshida is replaced, the Old Yeller that is FFXIV is nearing the point where it just needs to be put out of its misery.Don't give this your money. Plenty of people are going to quit over the upcoming changes. I quit for 4 years, came back for the ONE job that was actually fun to play, and literally in under a week, this crummy dev team shows us all once again they've learned nothing from past mistakes and don't listen to the people practically spoon-feeding them solutions to the problems it has.This game needs to die. I say this not as a hater, but as someone who truly loved this game. It doesn't need to keep on suffering, it just needs to be put out to pasture and we need a different dev team to make a new Final Fantasy MMO.

No lie, the dungeons, trials, extremes, they're all the best the game has ever seen. They are exceptional. Actual 10/10 content.

In this game, the balance is the exact opposite, with hours of cutscenes and dialogue between each action input. This, unfortunately, does not allow the amazing gameplay to carry this expansion.

Shes not exceptional in any way and as far as I can tell the only reason we feel she should lead is so that there isnt another war (which if we cared we should just be influencing Wuks brother who everyone seems to support rather than just blindly supporting this person weve known for a week). Literally every character is more interesting than Wuk. Also, why does Koana just look like a lvl 50 player character. Such a weird design choice. The story should have been centered around Erenville, someone we met in the previous expansion. They could have kept basically the same plot except he takes Wuks place. He had been exploring Eorzea not interested in the kingship and then came back and found out his brother was about to start wars so he felt he needed to take part in his adoptive fathers game, with our assistance. I seriously do not understand why the story we got was what they came up with. God I could literally talk for hours about how untalented the writing teams of these AAA companies are. I also find it  funny people say this expac is too political...have you guys not been playing this game? The ENTIRE FF14 story arc has been about politics. What I do think is that Dawntrail fails at creativity when it comes to the politics. They blatantly say modern day PC tag lines like ""cultures should be respected"" which is like yeah obviously and it wouldnt fall so flat if we hadnt just spent several expansions killing people of a dozen other cultures, and their gods. FF14 has been great at grey area politics and Im not sure but I would guess that some DEI department got their grubby hands on this one because its not super in your face but its much more noticible than its ever been which is sad because I expect more from Square. You cant create a fictional location based heavily off of Hispanic cultures and then make the natives bipedal worm lizard people and then preach to me about respecting cultures. One other thing Ill say is that the voice acting in this expansion has fallen off. Literally every NPC, whether they be human looking or a big fat bird person just sounds like hispanic americans. Its very unimmersive. Endwalker did the same thing with the Elephant race that just had Indian american accents. I feel like the VA direction is so boring - theres no creativity what so ever when it comes to creatures in this game anymore. It peaked at Midgarsormer. Im assuming this also falls onto some sort of DEI department. All in all this expansion seems no different than the others other than that the stakes arent as high. And thats fine. I think SQENIX needs to fire whoever is Disneyfying this game - whoever is making blatant statements about real world modern politics. SHOW DO NOT TELL. This is such a basic rule for writing. Dont tell me whats good and bad. Show me whats good and bad and show me why. Not to mention, Im a grown adult. I dont need someone who works at a video game company telling me whats right and wrong. and to be clear, this is not a huge issue in the game but as I said above, its much more noticible and I feel like its only gunna get worse if its not talked about. Give these guys an inch and the next expansion will be about a bunch of gun wielding fat pig people who stole the land from a race of wolves. its just cringe and I know there are people out there who are talented enough to express their beliefs without preaching about it.Edit lvl 95: Zareel Ja puts it best: “and what should she [Wuk Lamat] be rewarded for? Calling upon her minions to carry her victory?” The initial story is surprisingly awful-like the new Disney Marvel/Starwars projects. Upon starting the lvl 95 quests things begin to get interesting. There are some interesting themes sprinkled in but the vast majority of this expansion is embarrassingly adolescent. Wuk Lamat is boring and we literally do 90% of what she needs to do to be Dawnservant. This could have been three quests and an cutscene instead of drawing it out to 40. My biggest gripe though is the amount of plot holes. 1. Oral Ja wants to start a war with Eorzea and it’s mentioned several times in front of the Scions and we just..let him? I don’t think we would kill him but you’d think there’s be some tension between the Scions who just spent 4 expansions in war and have killed dozens of gods, basically. But no. It’s not really tackled at all in the first half of this msq. We just let this little lizard guy talk crap like he’s not gunna get stomped on by us. 2. Bakool Ja Ja kidnaps Wuk, tries to murder her, steals her keystone (that she’s been collecting for the contest) and again, the Scions do nothing. It’s not explained why Bakool is allowed to do all of this and not be disqualified while Zoraal Ja is disqualified for simply attacking a referee during a battle. Additionally, the entire Scions are allowed to assist Wuk in fighting her father, something required in order to win, while Zoraal had to do it alone. The rules are convoluted and written to make sense as to why the player character is here. It seems the writers just assumed we would be too caught up in the fun of fetch questing and making tacos that we wouldn’t notice that the entire plot of this is an absolute mess. (Btw, this was said in another review but I’m gunna echo it: we have an entire job that deals with cooking and there were two arcs about cooking food where we just run around and click sparkles on the ground. square needs to innovate their msq there’s not excuse for that)3. Gulool Ja Jas brother [his conjoined twin] has been dead for three years and apparently this has zero effect on his health? Like his dead head has just been there, looking not dead. Not slouching. Not dangling. Just there like a normal head but with its eyes closed. I’d think there would be some consequence of this as there is a dead head attached to his body but I guess I don’t know the biology of large two headed lizard folk. Just seems like lazy writing. I think they could have  made this make sense by changing it to be that the brother had recently died and so Gulool needs to crown a new Dawnservant before he dies as a result of his body going into sepsis or something. This would add some real weight to what’s going on. Instead, the story feels like something I’d write in middle or high school on wattpad. One other thing I’ll throw out here is there are several scenes that are supposed to be serious but have jazz playing in the background. At one point you meet a treasure hunter and he gets killed (supposedly) and it cuts to black and the Jazz music starts. Another point Kriles echo sees Zoraal Jas future wars and she’s having like a ptsd episode and again, the music is happy go lucky. This expac feels like a much inferior product.",1720128281,11,0,negative

This is maybe a consequence of Daichi Hiroi replacing Natsuko Ishikawa as head writer, although the writing may improve in patch content so I'll wait and see.Altogether great combat and gameplay but the story especially compared to previous expansions is a massive disappointment, and for a series that leans so heavily on good storytelling it really hurts to see this happen.",1720119792,9,0,negative

She doesn't bring anything to themes presented in 2nd half and even perspective she brings was based on events hours prior in msq which Imo doesn't earn her the right to speak up about it.

76561198085378649,0,0,english,"It's hard to believe this is an expansion of the same game that delivered writing of the caliber of Heavensward, Shadowbringers and yes even some of Endwalker. The story in Dawntrail is so infantile most of the MSQ script reads like an episode of the Pokemon anime show. It rethreads on a lot of themes and messages that were already covered in past expansions more than once, but in a more hamfisted way without much subtext to what message characters are supposed to convey.Most of your time as the Warrior of Light is spent babysitting a character that is essentially a repeat of Alphinaud and Lyse before they suffered their respective consequences for innocence idealism, and became better for overcoming it. Except this character doesn't really get challenged in that fashion at all... The entire world seems to bend to make sure Wuk Lamat doesn't NEED to change how she approaches things, ever.A lot of the new characters are very cartoony, with changes that happen too suddenly, or who don't get developed well at all, with the depth of a puddle.They once again repeated the mistake of squeezing two stories into 1 expansion. As a result you have some of the most miserably boring experiences in XIV's history for the first 7 levels worth of MSQ, then a rushed and undercooked darker plot that gets resolved in the most Naruto-esque fashion.None of the returning characters, aside from Krile and Erenville, get to be their own individual characters either. All Scions who show up are on auto-pilot and behaving like a hivemind or avatars to the mediocre writers. A couple moments are given for G'raha to introspect and give the kind of talk only he could do. Everyone else? Completely interchangeable, aside from the reasons they give to being there, which are arbitrarily picked by the scenario writers, with no weight on what they effectively do in the MSQ.Simply put the MSQ was tedious at best, trash at its worst. With few highs and a lot of drudgy lows.Field zones are hit or miss as always. Dungeons are same old hallway simulators with trash mob to spam aoes and try not falling asleep. Music is great, better than Endwalker's. And boss fights are fun and pretty challenging... Except for the incredibly distracting text they now feature with some of the boss mechanics. The devs must have thought this would help more with telegraphing, but it only adds to the visual pollution.Unfortunately some of the postgame boss mechanics I found insufferable. Having recently played through all of Coils synced, what made those fights fun was the group coordination and complexity of how to HANDLE the mechanics. Current postgame in Dawntrail seems to prioritize covering every corner of the arena and outside of the arena with shit to look at and rotate the camera 360 degrees, and sometimes even apply a ""brilliant"" design of using orange markers to avoid on orange ground.This expansion has killed my interest to unsub for a little while, assuming they improve things. If the MSQ is going to keep subtext and mature writing out like it has shown to since 6.1, and the cap-level mechanics are going to be a visual pollution mess, and you're not interested in the lifesim stuff, I don't think XIV is currently worth playing beyond the end of 6.0's storyline.There are lot of single-player games better than what this tries to do as one.

Fuck.Come final trial, we stand against it, alone, and using the Azem crystal TM we do the usual and use duty finder. Sadly the writers thought they could be clever and had our furry friend jump in mid transition and burst last 20% of the boss down for us. I was just so tired of her at this point, even through as I said, I started the journey being totally chill with her.And the final cutscene isn't even voice acted save for the final line, just like few other important dialogues in the main story.Gameplay wise, I felt robbed of many opportunities for duty quests (that means the single player encounter fights). From ones we got: one felt awesome and I could imagine my WoL enjoying it as much as I did; one felt like a plothole and one had weird pacing issues with a meh choice for the final boss. We even get a much worse version of Thancred's stealth mission from EW, as a trail quest. There are two big points in the story where we should had played as our friends, but instead we just get a cutscenes during which we just stand in the back.Dungeons felt good. As a midcore tank player (dunno how else to call myself if I do more things than casual players but don't do end game?) I felt like the difficulty was good. And the final trial packs a lot for something to be attempted blind, which is good! We need harder content in MSQ! And post-story dungeons are apparently pretty good as well (at the time of the writing, I went to do hardcore gathering instead of doing these for now).Random thing, but I really wish they haven't teased Solution 9 at all, to make things more exciting, but oh well, gotta hook people on more things than just a new adventure in the MMO they like.Now something a bit subjective: OST wise only few tracks really stood out to me, that being Solution 9's theme, Vanguard's theme and level 99 trial. I would add Tuliyollal to the mix, but the day theme's loop takes forever to get going and gets old quickly when teleporting around. Aside of that, BGM ranges from okay to annoying. It is thematic, sure, but not my cup of tea and a certain Rak'tika-from-LIDL and the very final zone (and a custom BGM that plays during one FATE there) just made me go listen to songs from the prior expansions instead.

The trials and dungeons show the typical polish expected of an expansion's main set, while Viper is fairly simplistic but ultimately and genuinely enjoyable. I have not played Pictomancer, the second newly added job, sufficiently to comment.But gameplay alone is worth little without a sufficiently compelling narrative and, after Shadowbringers and Endwalker, Dawntrail was at a disadvantage from the beginning. But even with that said, after playing for about ten years, for this to be the first expansion I can remember opening up a quest list to see how far away I am from the ending, I cannot give an optimistic answer and recommend this right now.Though, of course, future patches may change the verdict of this review.",1720107384,35,1,negative

But fuck that let's faff about for a few hours and then get surprised when the big bad actually starts his invasion"".

The quality of the writing and the pacing is just horrendous, and what ends up happening is you start noticing how forumalic the whole MSQ design is. I know, it's basicly the same structure as the many expansions before it, but when you got a good written story and interesting characters you don't mind. Unfortunately I ended up skipping many of the last cutscenes simply because I was fatigued by how little there was to gain from them, based on 90% of the earlier ones. And I have the patience of a saint. I have replayed all the exapsions twice without skipping a cut scene.I was waiting for the story to get good. I read that it gets better after the first half of the game. I disagree. Somewhere in the middle of the story it got more interesting yes. But I feel it went downhill after that again. They finally got me interested and they blew it.I don't mind my character not being the center point of the story. I don't need a looming doomsday plot. The stakes don't need to be high for a good story. Just make it interesting, and stop repeating the same sappy ""Friendship conquers all"" concept every single cut scene. It feels like they are targeting a new audience with this one. The story feels much less mature, and every single time something happens, you get 10 minutes of everyone explaining to you what's going on. ""This means that, and that means this"", yes, I know..Then there are the characters. I actually liked Wuk Lamat at the start of the expansion, but I can honestly say that I now LOATHE her. She's a one dimensional character with a catch phrase that never evolves into anything. She's painfully predictable. The rest of the characters are forgettable, not horrible, but not that interesting either.I mained a Viper for the MSQ and boy did I regret it. The job is a masterclass in style over substance. It's flashy and boring, and that gets old very quick.I have nothing bad to say about the art, the music (well except for the ending song), the dungeons and trials.

The dungeons and trials both have had new and interesting mechanics that make me look forward to later raids.What I don't care for is some of the class changes; like Machinist feeling much slower to play than it used to be but Dragoon has become much more manageable. The music has been also been a mixed bag, as it was not nearly as impactful as Endwalker and Shadowbringers but has some genuinely good tracks mixed in with a lot of unremarkable ones. The voice acting has also been comparatively disappointing so far, but something which can be easily overlooked.What I lament is the expansion's story. This should come as no surprise to anyone who's been reading the reviews. I won't talk about Wuk Lamat and the power of friendship only because it's already been so thoroughly touched upon already. Instead, I will add a few other points that I've noticed that finally led to my writing of this review.TLDR: The primary fault of several of our new characters is that they are made out to be something at the start and turn out to be something completely different later on. You cannot promise something and then fail to deliver, or go back on said promise. Dawntrail's story fell to a low I haven't viscerally felt since A Realm Reborn; it was hackneyed and in some cases senseless.[h3]  Spoilers, you have been warned... [/h3][u]Characters[/u][spoiler] 1. Bakool Ja Ja was poorly written because he's made out to be a thoroughly evil character from the start, even going as far as to release a Turalian primal for the sake of obtaining the throne. He laughs as he's releasing said fiend and explicitly commenting that he looks forward to the death and devastation the creature would bring, only to later have a COMPLETE 180 degree turn after being thoroughly bested. Not by you, mind, but by Wuk Lamat... [/spoiler][spoiler] 2. Sphene, Queen of ""Reason"" in Alexandria. What we have here seems to be an immortal Mary Sue, though I am not certain who is self-inserting themselves into her role. Everyone seems to have some sort of unconditional love for her for reasons that are not apparent to me outside of ""she talks to us"", which did very little good when the tyrant of the tale decides it's time to kill everyone. She can occupy and fully control whichever mechanical mannequin she would like on a whim. By all available evidence, she could have embodied any number of the metal marionettes and used their capabilities to defend her people at no real risk to herself, yet she doesn't. When a story battle commences, she sticks around for reasons unknown instead of leaving, which puts her in danger of some kind. Otis, her long lost guardian, is killed in action trying to protect her yet he knew full well that she is virtually immortal. Otis' sacrifice could have been prevented in its entirety if Sphene simply left or allowed her occupied body to be destroyed; as far as we players know, it's not as if she could die anyway. From the moment I saw her garish outfit, watched her mannerisms, and heard her voice I was reminded of Ryne from Shadowbringers, a character who is emotionally driven and far too eager to please. This is a glaring, not endearing, flaw which tends to make associating with such a character far more trouble than it's worth; and I have no choice to disassociate myself with such a character. At least Ryne had the excuse of being young, inexperienced, and idealistic. Sphene has had centuries of conflict and tragedy to reflect upon, yet she's no better for it, which leads me to believe that she is willfully ignorant. As it stands, Sphene is not worthy of her title and I have seen little evidence to suggest otherwise. [/spoiler][spoiler] 3. Zoraal Ja, the main antagonist of the game, was made out to be a competent stoic leader with misguided intentions at the start of the expansion, but then somehow spending 30 years in a time bubble made him into a bloodthirsty imbecile. As King of Alexandria what he could have and perhaps should have done was confiscate the 'accounts' of the civilians or even the 'regulators' off their very heads by force so that he could have the souls he required to power his conquest. If the population revolted, then he could have gone about killing them for the extra souls. Instead he merely loses his patience and orders the wholesale slaughter to commence right off the bat, forcing existing souls in John and Jane Doe's possession to be consumed to repeatedly revive them. Essentially, he is losing out on 2+ souls in order to acquire a singular soul, a disgraceful waste of valuable resources. [/spoiler][u]Story[/u]1. Several hours could be cut from the MSQ if the writers refrained from having the Scions or your Tuliyollan entourage pontificate on the importance of community and cooperation in every other quest. To paraphrase the late Stan Lee, you want to deliver a message without beating your audience over the head with it. The notion has become thoroughly waxed upon by the time you reach the halfway point, but it continues well into the latter half of the story.[spoiler] 2. The competition for becoming the next Dawnservant was a sadly hollow affair. Wuk Lamat was made out to be the underdog while her genuine competition, Zarool Ja, Bakool Ja Ja, and Koana were made out to be superior in every way. I understand that we can appreciate a good underdog story, but in the end there was no real contest, metaphorically and literally. The previews said that the Scions going to compete with one another, but there was never any combat against them, no philosophical debates, no battle of wits, not even an eating contest. Koana showed character growth and it would have been just as satisfying, if not more so, to actually see HIM win despite our best efforts and his shortcomings, but still realizing the value of having his sister serve alongside him. Instead, Zarool Ja is disqualified in what I believed to be an [b]uncharacteristic and sudden lack of restraint[/b] while Bakool Ja Ja, unsurprisingly, failed because he was just bad at everything he tried to do. Yet when it came to Koana he just gives up because he 'feels' like Wuk Lamat would be better, not because she truly bested him. He had a very solid chance of being able to succeed, learning from his mistakes and consulting others to strengthen his claim. Instead he chose not to and it 'feels' to me like it was for the expedience of the story. [/spoiler][spoiler] 3. I am not entirely certain about the political dynamics of Alexandria, but it seems highly arbitrary that they would be so willing to accept a 'King' from outside their own world to act as their commander in chief. For what reason was there no King from the onset? Were there no psychological screenings to determine the worthiness to rule? Was brute strength and the lucky possession of a literary McGuffin the only requirements? Perhaps this will all be explained in due time, but as it stands I am hard pressed to believe that a society so technologically advanced as to grant near-immortality as a matter of course couldn't have had countermeasures in place to prevent the potential abuse of powers. Yet this is exactly what happened.[/spoiler]Any other criticisms on my part from this point on would broach more into the subjective, rather than the objective. While I know writing a good story can be particularly difficult, especially when you have to somehow compete with the overwhelming success from Shadowbringers. I pray the developers will not be disheartened by this recent ordeal because I really do love the game and have invested far more time in it than some would consider healthy, but their writing team for this expansion needs to be either restructured or dismissed for failing to uphold the expectations promised by their campaigning.",1720097396,13,1,negative

Dungeons are interesting and don't put you to sleep like they did in Endwalker, same for the trials, which makes me excited for the savage raids and ultimates to come. So if you enjoy FFXIV for the combat content you will likely have a good time.What's not so much fun is the main story. I don't even know where to begin without spoiling much, but the writing and pacing feels like a mess. There are sections where you spend at least an hour doing nothing but fetch quests, there's hardly any fighting to be done compared to the amount of chore quests and cutscenes. It takes around 3-4 hours before you reach the first dungeon. The story gets more interesting during the second half, but the first half feels like a slog with very little if anything at all to keep you interested. Krile and Erenville don't get nearly as much screentime or presence as Wuk Lamat despite their backstories being way more interesting plot points, it feels like missed potential. Wuk Lamat is also an annoying character you end up being stuck with for most of the story, to the point she's considered by many Lyse 2.0 . It also doesn't help that her English VA didn't do that good a job at voicing her, which could be a VA problem or whoever was supposed to be directing the voice acting didn't care. Wuk Lamat's english VA just seems incapable of putting in any emotion in their lines and it hurts to listen to when the context really demands that emotion, especially when [spoiler] Wuk Lamat shows up during the final trial, it's supposed to be a high energy, somewhat desperate moment with Lamat screaming to Sphene in hopes of reaching out to her even through Sphene trying to crush her [/spoiler] and it feels like lines are just being read from the script with no context given to the VA. It feels absurd to me that anyone in the office listened to these lines and thought this was good enough and didn't ask for another take. For comparison, you can check the VAs from the JP/FR/GER versions.So all in all, as someone who wants to enjoy both the combat and the story, it's a very polarizing experience that doesn't leave me excited for more in the story department if not for the possibility that it can't get much worse. I'll keep this as a negative review until the first tier of savage drops at which point I will change it to positive if it's a good first tier, which would mean the combat content is more than good enough to compensate for the poor main quest story.",1720089206,60,1,negative

76561198047666174,0,0,english,"There will be spoilers. TLDR at the bottom.[h3] Quick Overview [/h3]First off, I'll start by saying the new dungeon mechanics and trials are definitely good, they've taken difficulty a bit more seriously with this expansion and this was needed. I don't always agree with vertical scaling of difficulty but this did take a more lateral approach and added some creativity which was heavily lacking towards the latter half of Endwalker.Some of the zones are nice, I personally enjoyed Shaaloani the most. The music is hit or miss for me personally, the songs aren't bad, but some will become extremely obnoxious with time or do not fit their setting, especially the Crash Bandicoot theme of Tuliyollal, hub zones having drums that assault your ears are not hub zones I ever want to sit around in.The graphics updates and the 2-channel dye system are a welcome addition, even if the dye is still heavily limited, it's still something. The graphics have gone a long way, the only negative I can say is that it's not ideal for those with lower specs, but there's so many layers to that onion that you can't necessarily fault SE for the change.Now to get into the real crux of the issue - the MSQ.I think it goes without saying that nobody was going into this expecting the next ShB or EW, it's unfair to say that anyone who didn't like the story didn't like it because it wasn't as spectacular as those patches. It's a ridiculous take, and disregards the concerns that most people have already brought forward.The writing in this expansion was weak, it was all tell and very little show. It was very clear that they chose this medium to afford themselves the task of actually showing, through retcons such as using a voidgate asset as a portal to another shard (presumably the 9th), and having Y'shtola just randomly say ""btw not all voidgates go to the void"" the moment it's shown. You spend hours in the early parts of the MSQ trying to learn about the world through being told about it and zero substance to back this up.[h3] The Chapters [/h3]You go to Kozama'uka (bird village) with Wuk Lamat to be told that a storm had recently killed several people and ruined their homes. There's a few torn structures, but the real issue was the fact that no one acted like anybody died, even though they repeatedly tell you that this small village of people had casualties, surely someone would mourn or grieve, but instead you get silly little scenes where the main character of the expansion and the village people just dance around and smile and just have nothing to show for this devastation that was wrought upon them.This chapter wraps up with a plot that retcons the way aether works, showing some dying crops that aren't fully grown, turn into fully grown healthy plants ready to harvest after 1 drop of aether and in another case, a transfusion of wind aether. Aether does not speed up time. Never in the story has aether ever been established as a force that can speed up the growth of things, by that notion you could force feed a child aether and they'd become an adult. It makes no sense.Urqopacha's chapter doesn't do anything egregious at first, but they tried to turn the MSQ into some kid's story book about the straw millionaire. It was long, and completely unnecessary. That entire chapter could've been written out and nothing in the story would change. The part that was really stupid was the kidnapping section, how are a group of scions standing 50 feet from Wuk Lamat, unable to see that she was taken captive by the equivalent of a trash mob. It was such a forced sequence that made no sense and the resolution was once again a tale from a kid's book.I don't have any real criticisms for Yak T'el, I think the development of Bakool Ja is welcome, and personally I enjoyed Shaaloani for the most part. I'm not gonna touch on the design for Heritage Found, Solution 9 and Living Memory, I was never going to be a fan of those to begin with but I'll keep my take out of this review as it's mostly personal preference, but I will just say the sense of urgency is so lost when exploring these zones. You're in the middle of a war and going shopping with the queen of the enemy nation is somehow a priority.[h3] Characters [/h3]Let's just get this out of the way right now, Wuk Lamat is a poorly designed character. This has nothing to do with the VA performance, I personally think they did a good job with the hand they were dealt, but Wuk Lamat as a character is insufferable. I don't think many people would've had a problem side-charactering for her if she just wasn't designed to be such a farce. Every 2 seconds she takes on a new anime protagonist trope, it's tiring, and fully lacks consistency. Remember how she's always been afraid of boats? Scroll up a sec and look at what she's doing 30 seconds into the gameplay trailer. Yep. Anyways.She lacks any structured development, constantly wavering from serious to stupid, written like a child's picture book character, she's impossible to take seriously, even when we're trying to discuss how to help a land that gets ravaged by a storm and her people are suffering, she just acts like comic-relief without the comic or relief, it's so unbelievably forced and unwelcome.The best I can say about characters in this expansion are regarding Bakool Ja and Koana. Both took on very big developments in their characteristics, none of which just happened overnight, they were well designed characters, seeing Bakool Ja slowly get humbled and still be himself but for the better, and Koana being a mystery that slowly emerged from his shell, these were great.As for Zoraal Ja, that was unfortunately just a very typical villain story with no point. This antagonist tells us about his reasons for betraying his father, was because he wasn't given the throne, even though he had the chance to be given the throne and failed it. He resorts to betraying everyone at the end of the competition, murdering his companion and going into ""the golden city"", later returning to announce that he's powered up and has apparently still been harbouring this grudge for 30 full years, proceeds to kill his father in another dishonourable act.After all the transgressions and chaos, the innocents slaughtered, the city laid to waste, he could very easily have achieved his goal upon his initial siege, but he decides no. He must battle Wuk Lamat in an honourable duel later and cancel the siege... Very consistent. It also ends with us going 8v1 against him because of course it does.[h3] Worldbuilding [/h3]I see so many takes about how this is building a new foundation on the world, but nothing about how this is disregarding and throwing aside factors of the world that already exist. I've already explained my issue with the aether retcon above.Moving onto more serious factors, why is there no mention of the Final Days? The whole world was attacked by Meteion's assault, yes only areas weak in aether experienced the full force of the assault, but as the EW role quests had shown, there were still cases all over Eorzea of several people becoming Blasphemies, but this just didn't happen across the entire continent of the New World?What's going on with the (supposed) 9th shard? How does a shard with such an outstanding force, and such a huge advancement in weaponry not be noticed by the Ascians upon their initial plan to rejoin the source? The Ascians had always utilised the most powerful forces of nations to aid in their goals, but no one thought to go use space-tech that can travel between shards without the assistance of an Ascian to lay waste to anyone opposing them?[h3] TLDR [/h3]I have no more room to type so I'm ending it here.If you like deep-lore, you'll be disappointed.If you like Disney kids movies, maybe this is for you.Dungeons/Trials are fun though.",1720083261,15,0,negative

She can do anything and everything. Sadly she's 1/10 what the WoL is, but she'll do it with pure sheer resolve. After the disappointment that was Endwalker, Dawntrail is a good, fresh start. It's sad that my WoL is sidelined by Wuk Lamat, and the writers try so hard to make us like her... I'm sad to say that I don't. I'm the one doing everything for her, and she's the main character?! I've killed primals, I beat up Ultima Weapon, I stopped the Dragonsong War, I liberated TWO nations from Garlean rule, saved a Reflection from the Brink of a Calamity, and stopped The Final Days. What has Wuk Lamat done in the meantime that makes her the main character all of a sudden? Being coddled by her adoptive father... and probably Koana. I don't know about the english VA, as I use Japanese voice over. Whether it's bad or not.... Music is good, dungeons are good, trials are entertaining....

And atm I do not have plans for endgame, and thus my only motivation is the merit of the story experience. I've heard fight design is good so far. If you're playing the MMO for endgame with a group and are hyped for that you'll likely be fine at least forcing your way through it. Visuals, environs, etc. are fine. The gameplay of the actually story/MSQ just feels bad, dated, unfun, slow, and boring. I've had access since early access and I keep forcing myself to chew bits of the story in an effort to be able to play with my friends. But I just find I'd rather do anything other than play this game. Lack of VA in some parts just seems completely unacceptable given the price tag of expac + sub. 90% of the MSQ is like a visual novel. But without voice acting. It feels lazy. I feel absolutely terrible trashing this so hard. I love ff14 (3100 hours total), i love my ff14 friends, and i have an insane amount of respect for Yoshi-P. But for $40+sub. Nope.EDIT: A quick comment on combat design and job changes. I personally have found most of the job changes underwhelming. Not much has changed- not necessarily a bad thing. But I was personally a bit bored with the jobs I was playing at the end of endwalker. Most changes boil down to. Push the same buttons, but now push some a second time to use a transforming combo action. It's not bad, if you're enjoying things. You'll continue to enjoy them. Pictomancer is fun and interesting from what I tried. It's not my aesthetic, but if I was to play something. It might actually be picto. And normally I play drg/rpr/gnb/drk.Viper aesthetically is very appealing, but I'm not sure the gameplay is for me. I think some people are really going to like it once they get into though. For me, I don't like that I can't push those combo buttons freely. it takes too much of the work out of it. And instead you're sort of just remembering which positional is coming next once you fully open. Dungeon bosses are better designed.

A lot of the negative reviews that this Particular Expansion has gotten, Is extremely merited. The story for the new ark was extremely lackluster, And I get it. New world to explore new problems to solve, New events to see… very few new characters to meet the graphics from previous expansions is visually stunning from the previous engine I would have to say. But the story writing was subpar at most. A realm reborn & Shadow Bringers had much better writing to them, More structure with a much more pleasing build up. Wuk Lumat came out as a hard ass, amazing adventurer. Warrior type with short temper and eager to get things done. And suddenly the new change of motive? Made no sense to me. Totally threw my original Views of the character when you first met them right out the window, From seeming so weak and vulnerable, And almost at their britches, in the lack of their problem solving skills during all these events. ( Like who hurt you during patch day for the two days we where gone ? )All in all, Near the end of the expansion, I felt like they dragged it out way too long they slopped some bits and pieces together, And just said eh, “ Screw it, Lets just go with it and make it as long as freaking possible” ( Filler Content ) The whole expansion was very dialogue and cut scene heavy Most of it with repetitive nonsense that you heard ten minutes ago or read.  If you want a summary of all of this Just go spend 59.99 On Cyberpunk 2077 …. You will get a much better story. Cause that’s what this whole Expansion turns into – FFXIV + Cyberpunk Ending + Uploading Consciousness to the cloud. And keeping the dead alive. I saved you nonsensical reading so feel free to skip the cut scenes  and not listen to poor dialogue.  It was just not for me, For those that do enjoy it good on you. Now lets get to the other nitty gritty of things Class’s : Dear freaking god, They Homogenized classes even more. And made classes like BLM Clunky and useless, In favor of their new shiny class Pictomancer. Not much has really changed for other classes, A few little tweaks here and there. But Nothing has been gained out of it all. If not some classes feel more clunky than what they did in the previous class, Some classes having their abilities or things taken away like damage dealing gap closers that draw no more aggro, Gap closing can no longer be apart of your rotation unless you’re a paladin and or warrior. Picto is a copy paste Summoner, with cast times. Viper, Seems like it was all Hyped but no one really talks about it right now at this given moment, All in all, I can’t really Recommend this expansion to everyone, It might not be for everyone but it is also necessary to get because without it your not seeing lvl 100 anyways.  So take it as you will. This is just absolutely subpar and unlike SE to put out something like this. I hope they make up on this with future patches and maybe expand on this cause it has felt really lack luster at most . ",1720076520,16,0,negative

76561198276540854,93652,53,english,"FFXIV Dawntrail's story is polarizing. It has really high highs but also very low lows, in part because of abysmal pacing, terrible voice direction from the entirety of the new cast that makes ARR looks decent, inconsistency with what cutscnes are voiced and certain scenes where the devs don't take the situation as seriously as they should. For the first half things were pretty dull as it is if they just took 5 beast tribes and made it into the first half of the main story. By the time the story gets really damn good, Im at the level 98 quests and the game is almost over. It makes me wish they we couldve gotten an expansion about the stuff regarding solution 9 only and not Tural.The new character Wuk Lamat is center stage instead of your oc being the main character. On paper its not a terrible idea, but in execution it leaves alot to be desired as the english voice direction for her is terrible (it got so bad I had to switch the voices to JP just to make her tolerable), repeating of the same tired jokes (gets sea sick and is a big scaredy cat) and constant talk about happiness and rainbows makes her character insufferable at times, however, when the story takes itself seriously, she has some genuinely great moments and you see her slow evolution from a spoiled brat who knew nothing about Tural into someone who knows more about her people and wants to keep the peace between them all. But those moments are few and far between. The scions are such an afterthough that imo you could remove most of them from the story and nothing would change, theyre all pretty much there just to cash in a check. Gulool Ja Ja is an interesting character but like Ernville, Krile and Kanao, he doesnt get enough screentime to make him that interesting. I wish we had more screentime with them especially since at the end I found the new reveals about Krile and Ernville fascinating, and I wish they had gone into more time with them.When it comes to the combat and fight design however, I have nothing but positives about it. Fight design for the dungeons and trials is absolutely fantastic, bosses are frantic, chaotic and challenging with interesting new mechanics. Fights got so intense that I was running low on MP on a scholar from how hard I had to work to keep the party alive.

I already set low expectations before for the main scenario since this was the start of a new saga but even then it still managed to hit an all time low I've never experienced before. Easily the weakest story expansion out of all releases. I'd rate the story a weak 4/10. It simply doesn't meet the quality and standard of a vibrant FFXIV story.On the other hand, the battle content is a big step up compared to last expansion, Endwalker. Dungeon bosses and the trials ooze creativity once more and provides a challenge that is balanced for casual as well for midcore players. Fingers crossed and high hopes for the upcoming field operations and (alliance) raid series! I'd give it a solid 8.5/10 so far!And in all honestly, if it wasn't for the battle content, Dawntrail would've been an ultimate failure of an expansion.

The story is 95% cutscenes, with barely any interaction from the player between quests beyond the usual ""go here, talk to this person, now go here and talk to someone else"". I will give it credit where credit is due: the team did follow up on requests to have less solo content. Where I'm at so far, there's only been two solo instances. The scenery is by far the best yet, absolutely amazing for gposes and landscape screenshots. The new jobs are rather impressive, both being far more powerful than some previous jobs, even going so far as being able to easily draw aggro off a tank even with their tank stance turned on.Now for the bad stuff:The fights: while impressive, the fights are far harder than any previous content to date. What should take a party 15 minutes to complete can, and often will, instead take 30-60 minutes to beat, often resulting in members of the party struggling to keep up. Not only that, but they took away our good friend Invincibility upon Resurrection. A player can be resurrected, only to immediately die right as they touch the ground, there are no immunity frames to grant the player a moment to heal and prevent immediate execution by random boss attack. If you get rezzed, you're practically better off staying dead. Oftentimes it's rough on healers, as they run through MP so much faster due to the loss of those immunity frames. Long story short: everything is, difficulty-wise, as though Endwalker and Shadowbringers were mashed together to make one big, horrendously difficult love-child, one can only hope this is the result of a hidden ""challenge mode"" and that these things will become easier soon, otherwise I imagine many will be driven off.New Players: As to be expected of a new release, a great many new players have arrived in Eorzea, many of which will grow angry if you are struggling with old content due to either having not done the content in awhile, or they deem that you're not paying attention, even if you are, they do not care, and will threaten to vote kick you, even at risk of other members of your party leaving should they actually do so.Story: The story is horrendously slow going for at least the first half (I'm just reaching the middle as I write this), many quests being either follow/lead X npc to Y destination, or simply talking quests. It would almost seem as though our time as the WoL is done for the moment, and that we are mentoring a half-baked character who seems to be a conglomeration of poorly written protagonists, more for her benefit than our own. We are not the hero here, but rather an observer and advisor, and there is little we contribute to the story beyond simple recommendations. Some dialogue choices that are presented to you do not even matter, as selecting them will simply result in NPCs telling you that you should wait a little longer before saying them. Alongside this, our fellow Scions feel far from themselves, often seeming just as bland and tasteless as the very apprentice the WoL seems to be mentoring. As mentioned before, story dungeons and trials are far harder than previous content, making even Endwalker's The Dead Ends look like a walk in the park by comparison.Overall, the expansion almost feels half-baked. The story is by far the most boring I've played so far. The dungeons are much too difficult for those wishing to simply play casually. The characters often seem more like stand-ins rather than the very characters we've grown to love in previous content. Locations are quite beautiful. New jobs are amazing, if only they weren't brought in during what seems to be another Heavensward.",1720054985,12,0,negative

Some ""twists"" are an absolute insult to pretty much anyone's intelligence, and overall the story plays way too safe with everything (which has slowly become tradition for the series); there is no stakes, and at no point did it feel like there was any hard choices / sacrifices to be made.

76561197960985246,321935,620,english,"! Spoilers Included !Final Fantasy XIV: Wuk LamatHave you ever wanted to experience becoming a secondary character in your own story? To feel what it must be like to be one of the NPCs following the great Dawnservant of Light. I know I haven't. But at least the music and combat is on point! When Wuk Lamat was first introduced I loved the character, she was a breath of fresh air and her jovial attitude made her likeable. I read someone compared her to the anime character Naruto which I can honestly see.[spoiler]Following the different promises during their rite of succession, we got to learn about the history and culture of the varied peoples of Tural. It was both fun and interesting to learn more about the continent and see how the characters both grew along the way.Shaaloani ends up being a really nice zone, I found myself vibing with the wild west asthetic and by coincidence it's the zone Wuk Lamat doesn't assist you in whatsoever.The succession happens and the tilted Zarool Ja comes to kill his father, after 30 years had past for him... This made little sense after obtaining a much greater power, but we'll chop that insanity and merely being used as a plot device to advance the story and introduce the Alexandrians. The mystery surrounding heritage found and it's people was was interesting, Solution Nine looked great and allows the game to introduce more modern glamour or future tech while being lore accurate.Even having not played much of FF9, Alexandria was hands down my favourite zone to inhabit. The people, music, design  it was great and I really wish I could have seen more! It's a real shame to me that the most interesting zone is now completely dead and devoid of character and the only way to revisit it is via NG+. I completely understand from a story perspective why that choice was made.Wuk Lamat being part of the party to defeat Zarool Ja made absolute sense, to get revenge for her farther and people slain and that's really where her participation should have ended, did she really have to come with us to Alexandria? She could have stayed in Tuliyollal and left it to the scions to deal with. During the Queen of Resolve trial, her coming in at the last moment to Mary Sue the party to victory was down right infuriating to say the least.A nice touch would have been the adventurer being immortalised in the stone plaques in Tuliyollal but instead it was the Dawnservents. The final cut scene does give me some hope that we can go more down the Azem route and explore other reflections as long as we can leave Wuk Lamat behind to run her city like we did Lyse.[/spoiler]If I had to summarise my biggest issue with the story and in particular Wuk Lamat, it would be... Fatigue. By the end of the MSQ it had turned a character I loved into one I hated seeing on the screen. A character which had twice as many spoken words as the next character.Lastly if you're going to make cities bigger, can we please at least mount up in them? Even if flying isn't allowed.",1720054643,11,0,negative

76561198087111991,0,0,english,"This expansion's base patch (7.0) has been the WORST expansion in terms of story I've ever played in FFXIV. The content added in such as Dungeons and Trials is very entertaining and innovating and the gameplay aspect is wonderful, however, the dip in quality of the writing has never been greater. Not only has the voice direction for the new american voice actors for the EN voices been absolutely awful with the main character of the expansion not conveying any emotion for most of the expansion (the VA is very good however the voice director really wasted their talent by not conveying scenes correctly) but also most new characters never screaming and only 'talking in caps'.In regards of the story itself, beware of spoilers:[spoiler] The first arc of the story the sucession arc is the highlight of the expansion, it starts off as a slog like every other expansion in FFXIV but really gets interesting with each culture feeling brand new and makes you a bit attached to them. However there's a lot of moments in the story where they constantly hammer you with Wuk Lamat's confidence issues without being subvertive at all, it's like the scions are only there to state the obvious and to comfort Wuk Lamat whenever she needs confirmations. Also, the humor is very corny, fit for a manderville questline, not the main scenario quests. The new main writers have really outdone themselves in making the worst decisions for pacing, it's as if Ishikawa, the previous main writer for the past two expansions, gave them a general plot and made them connect the gaps between the main plot points and they failed to do so in any comprehensible way. Another problem with the quests is the huge amount of errand-boy, this being after HUNDREDS of hours of playtime you'd have to still talk to a NPC 3x, complete quest, walk a few meters and talk again complete quest, the huge lack of gameplay in the main scenario quests is palpable and they had multiple opportunities to add something unique, definitely disappointing.For the second part, and what is the worst part of the expansion is the second arc: The very last zone Living Memory is just a rehash of the previous 2 expansions last zones, except inverted? Worse? The new writers were so lazy they couldn't come up with anything new and had to repeat what worked before but not get the reason why Amaurot and Ultima Thule worked out so good. Now after you finish the main scenario questline you're left not only with a disappointing story conclusion where everyone dies and you pulled the trigget to kill them but also one of the most beautiful maps of the entire game left into a monochrome .jpeg slapped on top as a repeated pattern texture, even the music has been almost muted!Lastly, the one part that affected this expansion at every single waking moment: There's too much Wuk Lamat! Every quest she has to tag along with you, it's as if she's the new stand-in for the protagonist! She not only overshadows every other character but the player itself! The writers seriously overestimated how much she would be liked and don't get me wrong, Wuk Lamat is a nice character but not in the quantities presented!I've played this game since 2021 and have LOVED every expansion until now, but after finishing the new expansion's story today, I have been left disappointed.[/spoiler]Overall, this expansion ranks the worst for me in terms of story, but only thanks to the very high quality graphical update and the awesome dungeons and trials it is passable.However this trend CANNOT continue and I seriously hope Square Enix listens to player feedback and doesn't repeat such mistakes in the upcoming post-patches for this expansion and future expansions.",1720054120,10,1,negative

There is no friendly competition between us and the other Scions like we were promised.

Poor pacing in the first half of the MSQ filled with what must be close to 30 talk to 3 people, stand here for 10 seconds, watch this cut scene quests. Shadowbringers and Endwalker at least had stories that were up to the task of hiding the tediousness of these quests. I'd be shocked that people were surprised by the divisiveness of this expansion or its mixed reception, but the community has made it clear how they feel about criticism  for years.  Even now when you go through comments and the like on social media its plagued with, ""you're playing it wrong"" or ""you skipped all the cut scenes of course you don't like it"" and my favorite ""It's always been like this what are you expecting?"" The writing was on the walls for weeks as well. I've heard Yoshi-P say the term ""8.0"" more times in most of his interviews than I heard him talk about this expansions new features. The vast majority of which weren't even shipped in the game and won't be added until future updates. This repeated formula for the last 3-4 expansions has gotten tiresome and lazy. They even reuse music constantly in this expansion and new music (arguably the best part of it so far) is few and far in between. The expansion has to many cut-scenes that summarize the previous cut-scene writing is the opposite of concise and poorly paced. Without spoilers charter development for some of the mainstays in this expansion doesn't happen until the absolute last minute that it can, and feels rushed despite all the filler they had before they could have filled it with.

I wont speak on the culture aspect since I'm not an american nor do I have any interest in N|S america in general, but it seems Like the only thing they nailed right. Yet beside that, it's so hard to find a single thing which is actually good about this dlc. I had low expectations, but they got broken too. To put pros and cons in simple terms:+1. Good location designs. the best in this game so far. The amount of care and details put into them is really noticeable2. Good dungeons, they've definitely improved from previous expansions3. Erenville4. Two dye system-1. Story. Having a bad story in a story based game is a crime. If you don't like the msq you are left with nothing quite frankly. I would give it a pass if it was a game for 12-14 yo kids, but its not. Writing team is so afraid to let anything meaningful happen. All your losses are superficial and in a game, which focuses on you own customization character, you as a player is here as a decoration. You are not a part of the story like at all. Every single moment is predictable in a not good way and every single problem is solved by power of friendship. My little pony done it better2.Eng dub. And no its not about Wuk Lamat's va. The entirety of English voice cast is the worst I ever heard. Don't know what went wrong this time, but switching dub language makes your experience less miserable3. Graphic update. It's now a wax figure museum. They promised to keep the identity of the game and failed on their words. If you are attached to your character a lot, yo will probably be disappointed.4. Gear. Most of the gear are reused assets. And they couldn't even keep one design philosophy for same sets. The difference between vanguard tank set and every other vanguard set is painful. You 're paying almost 40 for a dlc and won't even get a good looking gear. A lot of job gear also looks like half reused designs5. Wuk Lamat. I don't hate her. But I hope she will not take 90% of screen time in future patches. She is absolutely unbearable and is another victim of terrible writing. If you don't like her you will not like the story6. Job identity. Just forget it. It's gone and their team doesn't seem to care7. Music. The most forgettable soundtracks. And 10 years old music sequences are getting really old. Are no one tired of hearing same melodies in exactly same plot points? I've played this expac since early access and I can't remember a single one.As a conclusion.

However, the second half is full of constant plotholes, poorly managed tension (the cast starts singing and camping out for a few days while people in need are in immediate danger), and inconsistent or otherwise insufficiently explained spirituality and lore that at best, completely disrupts the themes that they were aiming for, and at worst, leads your character to commit what I would consider to arguably be the mass killing of innocent people for no real reason. Even the reason for doing so, that the main character was given, is never brought up again and is never fulfilled, resulting in 6 hours of totally pointless quests with no impact on the story, even if you are invested. Are people considered living if they have a soul and memories? Great question, but the game simultaneously decides yes for some people, and no for others, without any discussion or reason why.

The story are somewhat complicated  like we know about Electrope and everything but Sphene being endless like everyone else and being the real final boss break my heart plus I dont like the fact about the soul collecting to become one with soul to gain power and erasing soul with memory in final zone which make me very angry than seeing 120 dead children in Skydeep dungeon so what Im trying to say here is it just not right with the story. 3.

Zoraal Ja intention was unknown to us becuz according to Zoraal Ja, he stated he want to peace and protect his peoples of Tural by become Dawnservent so instead of the writer who make him look evil, he should have been a hero like he helped us in Valigarmanda boss. honestly opinion I was hoping Sareel Ja to be the true villain but still no change thx to the writer. that is my real opinion about DT msq so it 4/10 to me",1720043167,5,0,negative

Yet Dawntrail's MSQ is just bad. Just because it's the start of a new arc doesn't mean it has to be so boring. If the biggest strength and central game of the game is bad, what else is there?You're not main character in the story, but instead some annoying cat is. There was poll for most favorite character in the story, yet this cat didn't make it even into top 10. Keep in mind there's perhaps like 20 notable chracters in total. That's how bad it is.Everything evolves around this annoying cat. She says she has lot to learn, yet her actions are always perfect and she always knows what to do. No clue what player character's role is even supposed to be, we just stand in the backgroud most of the time. She's not necessarily bad character, it's just that anyone with so much exposition gets annoying very quickly. She became Poochie of FFXIV. EN voice is just terrible, I didn't know it's possible to shout in lowercase. Don't even bother and switch to JP.Actual story is spread very thin, since there's insane amount of padding. No, it's not worldbuilding when you go to traders' village, and find out that... they do trade. It's nothing but waste of time. This keeps repeating, you keep going from village to village, find 1 or 2 uninteresting quirks about them, you solve their issue and you go to the next village. If that sounds boring, then that's because it is. First 2-4 hours have genuinely 0 gameplay, it's all cutscene after cutscene.Budget is so low. So many cutscenes are unvoiced, you can easily get 5-6 unvoiced cutscenes in the row. Luckily you know that nothing important will happen to them, so you can just skip it. Story gets better at 97, then most of 99 MSQ is back to padding, and then 100 trial gets ruined by the damn cat again. I hope we never see the Poochie Lamat again. Job design is atrocious. They doubled down on the already bad job design in EW and even straight up said they won't start fixing it until the next expansion, so please look forward to it in 2027. But fights seem so much better so far,The graphical update is still not finished. It was initially meant to be released gradually in EW patches, yet whole expansion later, it's still far from finished, not even gear of the main NPCs is done. Same goes for the second dye channel, it seems like barely a quarter of all gear supports it, and even if it does, the second channel can be for some random details like tassels or strings on a button. After lackluster patches in EW, is this really all they've been working on?I knew that Shadowbringers was the peak and it would be hard to come close to it, but I didn't expect such a drastic fall from grace. It's not like DT was a one-off, the previous 6.X story (made by same writers) was awful too.",1720039243,9,0,negative

Wuk Lamat agrees and gets kidnapped-Why were the Scions and the player character fine with Wuk Lamat a princess going alone with a man we don't know in an area we previously talked about having bandits?-How did she get kidnapped walking back to a village in literal eyesight of the Scions and the player character?-How did she get taken by bandits weaker than most trash mobs in the game even though she is a warrior princess that fought in the previous dungeon with us?I don't know and story has quite alot of moments like this and personally I think this is the worst story FFXIV has written and has some of the worst voice acting that isn't just Wuk LamatEND OF SPOILER-Something about the gameply that I think is getting ignored is how easy old content has become. During early acess I grinded levels for pictomaner along with 2 vipers and a healer that was nice enough to help us get fast ques in roulette. Even though we 3 dps were still learing our new jobs that came out that day we had little to no issue finishing all the roulettes including a lvl 80 dungeon.NOTE we finished multiple dungeons including a high level one with no tank, this is a problem. At this point any content older than the current expac is just practicing your rotation with little to no chance of dying assuming you're paying the minimum amount of attention. But even the new 91-100 dungeons that people complained about being too hard are now just like any other dungeon now that people know what to expect and also having higher level gear. Throughout the previous expansions I got every job to 90 and now I don't have much motivation to get more than a couple jobs to 100I had plans to get back into raiding and finding new friend groups this expac back with the combination of the shitty story and content becoming so easy it feels like busy work or a chore I'm gonna unsubscribe and use my money for the subscription to save for better gamesEven when the next major patch comes out I'm going to wait and see if the story improves and if they make adjustments to gameplay, if not I'm gonna skip out on this expansion and accept I just wasted a good chunk of money for the expansion and the subscription",1720036311,7,0,negative

76561198083145111,0,0,english,"Alright, since I've finished the MSQ I think its only fair that I give this a review and my thoughts on the matter. I've been an avid and dedicated player of XIV with over 400 days, 23 hours, 27 minutes logged on my account so I think I have just as much as a valid opinion on this expansion as anyone else does. Overall I think this expansion was...just mid at best. However I think all the negatives just outweigh the positives in this. So here is a little TLDR;Pros:-More content to do in XIV-The dungeons and trials were good-Love Letter to Final Fantasy IX fansCons:-Horrible story pacing.-Story doesn't get interesting till the lvl 97 dungeon.-Wuk Lamat's EN voice is dreadful. An AI program could do a better job. (First time I felt I had to switch to JP VA).-Not a summer vacation as much as it is a babysitting mission.-A lot of what makes the later half of the story good will be lost on people who haven't played or know the story of FF IX.-Wasted character potentials.[h3]====THE MSQ====[/h3]The progression through the MSQ was....incredibly slow and dull to put it bluntly. Like I get it, we are coming to a new location in the world of Eorzea so we have to be introduced to the people, their culture, and how things operate in Tural. However, the way it was done really struggled to keep me interested. I don't know what changed with the pacing and the writing because the way it was done back in say like Shadowbringers when we were learning about the First was way more interesting and engaging. This was just a bore to sit though. Hell I think the way it was done in Stormblood when we first came to Kugane and learned how things worked there was far more interesting. Another point of contention I have with this expansion's story is that it was promoted as a 'Summer Vacation' for the Warrior of Light. This was anything but that; it was more or less an expansion long babysitting mission with the WoL watching over Wuk Lamat and only jumping in the mix when she needs help. Not the most exciting thing in the world honestly in my honest opinion. Another thing was that we were told that the Scions would be at odds against each other in all of this, and I was really expecting for us to have to fight the other Scions while competing for the title of Dawnservant. That never really happened, and I'll be honest here, I was expecting something a little more serious.Which brings me to the next thing...the story doesn't get interesting till you get to the lvl 97 dungeon and doesn't really pick up until after the dungeon is finished. Which is really sad because that's like what.. 60-70% of the story? That's just really disappointing because this Expansion is supposed to be a love letter to Final Fantasy IX. I love FF IX as much as the next Final Fantasy fan, and I do think that the references and parallels to the story in IX were very good. However, if that's the only thing that Dawntrail has going for it then that's not a whole lot to go on now is it? Shadowbringers and Endwalker already set a bar really high that I kept my expectations fairly on the down low for this expansion I know that trying to compare this to those two is a bit unfair, but at the same time there's no excuse for the beginning half of the story to be this boring and the good parts just jam packed towards the later half.[h3]====THE CHARACTERS====[/h3]Oh boy the characters....I want to say that there is like only 4 characters in the MSQ that are remotely even important? Wuk Lamat obviously, and then there's Krile, Zoraal Ja, and the Enigmatic Maiden ([spoiler]Queen Sphene[/spoiler]). Pretty much everyone else including the Warrior of Light (yes, you the player) felt like they're all just side characters in the grand scheme of this story. Because this story isn't about you as the WoL coming to the new world to just find the city of gold. This is Wuk Lamat's story. Dawntrail's MSQ is mainly focused around Wuk Lamat. Which don't get me wrong its a nice and interesting twist on things and I'm no stranger to games or stories where the Main Character/Protagonist isn't the main focus. I just feel like it could have been done better. Now, a lot of people will have mixed feelings about Wuk Lamat; some enjoy her and others don't like her all that much. I do genuinely think that she is an okay and decent character. She may not be the best or well written character, but I do think that she is okay. For me though she is just not the kind of character I personally like or enjoy because of her unbearably naive way of thinking. That and while she may not have all the qualities of a Mary Sue, she kind of comes off as that way. That isn't my problem with her...my main issue with her, is the EN voice acting....I have absolutely no idea what Square was doing with the EN voice acting for this character, but Wuk Lamat's EN voice is absolutely god awful and atrocious. I couldn't hear it all that well from the Dawntrail trailer, but after hearing her speak in game I felt like my soul wanted to curl up and die. The voice just felt...completely out of place, stilled and was immersion breaking, it was so off. I immediately switched the voice acting to JP because there was no way I was going to sit through a whole expansion listening to...whatever the hell that is. I have never switched the Voice Acting from English for the longest time since I first started playing during Stormblood and thought the EN voice acting was okay. However this was a first I felt like I had to change the voice acting to JP. Which is unfortunate because again this whole expansion is focused on Wuk Lamat, so I have no idea why Square would do her dirty like that...Do better Square please I know you can deliver on high quality voice acting.Wuk Lamat aside the only person that kept me interested in the MSQ was Krile and her part in all of this, I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil anything but she played a major key role in all of this. So much that I kinda wished that this expansion was more about her instead of Wuk Lamat. I just feel like her backstory should have been the main focal point instead. If anything I would say she was the one character I was more invested in and was cheering on the most in all of this. And I mean...come on its Krile we are talking about here, shes been through so much with the WoL (the player) that you can't help but hope things go well for her. Zoraal Ja would be next on the list of important characters that played a key role in the MSQ. Listen, I'm just going to say it straight and forward. Zorral Ja along with Krile and the Enigmatic Maiden were the only ones keeping me invested in the MSQ. Krile I've already gave my reasoning. Zoraal Ja I was more curious about him because well...I wanted to think there was more to his actions, his reasons, and his words than what was being presented. To an extent there was, and in the end I wasn't disappointed with his role in the story. I will say however that I think there should have been a little bit more to touch up on his character a bit. Like tell us how he was like growing up, what his experiences were and such. Lastly the Enigmatic Maiden...this part is going to be mostly spoilers but I'll try to keep it down low. I found her part in this far more interesting than anything else in the MSQ to be honest. Which like I said is sad because she doesn't become relevant till way later in the MSQ. Another thing is, is that while I like all the FF9 references being brought up from her introduction, at the same time all of this is going to be lost on someone who hasn't played FF9. With that in mind I fail to see how an average player who has no knowledge of FF9 in general can enjoy this part of the MSQ. Which, again makes it even more sad because the MSQ doesn't become interesting till she is introduced and you get all of the reference drops. That being said though I did enjoy her role in the MSQ overall and liked her character dynamic.",1720034622,11,0,negative
76561198106318599,0,0,english,"I've been playing this game for 8 years and I don't think I've had a harder time getting through the main story as I have with Dawntrail. I really wanted Dawntrail to be good but my disappointment with it was great enough to make me write this review.To start off is a warning about people going in about expectations. Think you're getting the vacation expansion to have a low-stakes story and decompress after the back-to-back world-ending stakes of Endwalker from the trailer? Think again as Dawntrail has both world-endangering and world-ending stakes compressed into one plot. No breaks for us, nope! It's not like trying to get the player to take the main threat seriously after defeating the reality-ending force of existentialism itself is going to be very difficult when someone thinks about it for two seconds.Gameplay during the majority of the main story brings up the question of ""what gameplay?"" since the majority of gameplay you get after walking around and performing ""talk to 3 villagers to understand an entire culture"" and the occasional ""follow/lead NPC to X location"" is just cutscenes. There's long gaps of time between the usual formulaic dungeon-trial-dungeon structure of the story where you rarely if ever actually use your combat skills leading to a good majority of the story simply an unbroken chain of fetch and talking quests. For the single-player instance encounters they pale in comparison to the instances that Shadowbringers and especially Endwalker had. The combat in those make some of the easiest instances I've played in recent FF14 history and lack of the spectacle or complexity means that neither your eyes or your brain are awed by it. The dungeons and trials at the very least this expansion's gameplay's saving grace, providing a higher challenge compared to previous dungeons for even me, a midcore player. As for job changes your mileage may vary. The changes to the jobs I consider my mains simply made them clunkier versions of their Endwalker iterations and only decreased my enjoyment playing them.As for the story where do I even begin? It's no secret that one of the primary reasons for Dawntrail's mixed reception was the story and after playing through the entirety of it I now really understand where it's coming from. Firstly, the main requirement of enjoying this story hinges on the one, single question: ""Do you like Wuk Lamat?"". This is because she is stuck to you for an overwhelming majority of the story and breaks from her presence and spotlight are incredibly sparse and I don't say this as if she's taking only you, the Warrior of Light's spotlight, no, she takes [i] everyone's [/i] spotlight. Other characters that you meet and accompany are simply in the same boat as the WoL and are secondary to Wuk Lamat in every category, even Krile who had buildup to be important in this expansion but only receives a small portion of the story to paying-off that buildup. This results in characters which are introduced in this expansion being underdeveloped and unable to compel me in remotely caring and returning characters that I was attached to being nothing more than planks of wood that excuse themselves with contrivances to leave the party when they're no longer needed. While the WoL taking a secondary role happened in Stormblood to Lyse at least in that expansion we were given our own reasons to be invested in the story through the characters we met along the way and the WoL's dynamic with Zenos.Wuk Lamat as a character herself has the writers put her in an incredibly difficult position to be likable from the outset with her hot-headed, enthusiastic warrior set-up in Endwalker's patch story being discarded to instead be a self-doubting sheltered kid that doesn't know the basics of her land and her people, somehow requiring us to babysit her as she learns something that should've been already known to her as a native. Her naivety results in her making mistakes including one which endangered her own life and somehow resulted in her not learning a single lesson as she carries the same naivety to the ending unchanged but without the self-doubt. And not content with simply being effectively mentally unchangeable she also grow substantially more powerful in combat prowess over the course of the story but us as the player don't really see why and how she does before being shown her being able to fight enemies she was previously unable to contend with. The story desperately wants you to like her and want her to ascend to being the next Dawnservant but gives no reason to trust her capability to actually rule other than her vague promises of peace and happiness for Tural which she repeats many, many times as if we don't get it already. This is in competition to three other contestants that are much more interesting in their goals but us as the player are given no option to support or find out more of as the plot confines us to supporting Wuk Lamat. And when she does become Dawnservant the different groups of people supporting other candidates stop mattering and suddenly love her despite not having a strong starting base of supporters and nothing she promises truly meeting what opposing cultures want. The differences between candidates is also diluted when her brother is fully converted to supporting her which leaves the competition to be framed into simply ""good vs. evil"" when previous political plot lines in FF14 were at least trying to be more nuanced.At the end she's a generic shonen protagonist without the essential steps to being a decent shonen protagonist that also has the repeating joke of seasickness attached, because I guess they needed us to have that drilled into our head along with her goal of peace. And considering that she takes up most of the spotlight while other characters get benched, if I don't care about her what else is there to care about?As for the antagonists they don't fare much better as the bunch of them either get converted to good by Wuk Lamat and then dropped from the story or don't have time to be developed before dying and receiving a last minute sob story to illicit a response from the player. One of them even gets a son that they severely neglect but somehow gets revealed that they cared about them all along in their last words despite it being emphasized earlier that they, the parent, was a horrible person. I sincerely don't know what they were trying to accomplish with that scene.The plot itself for the first half is mostly uneventful, doing quests similar to beast tribe quests we would've done as side content in any other expansion. The second half of the plot felt rushed, hampered by the amount of time that was taken by the first half of the story and connected only by the off-screen actions of others and a thin thematic connection of memories and immortality while lifting story beats from Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Zones come and go as we don't spend nearly enough time to learn more about the local cultures and ends up making each culture that Wuk Lamat, and by extention the player, have to learn about be defined practically by one trait, a far cry from the amount of detail that non-city locations had in previous expansions. This isn't helped by amount of stating obvious subtext and redundant dialogue that really should've caught by editors that result in cutscenes of nothing that are longer than they should be and negatively affect the pacing (seriously, did you need to both tell and show me how something works three times in a row?). Overall the plot lacked both the highs and lows of previous expansions leaving it not just forgettable but due to similarities to Shadowbringers and Endwalker, derivative.This expansion is substandard, a first in my experience with FF14. It doesn't respect the player's time, their intelligence, or characters that aren't Wuk Lamat. Maybe the patch story would be better, who knows? But this lack of quality shouldn't be the first step for a new era of FF14.",1720033482,16,1,negative

76561198168369365,0,0,english,"To start off, this dlc will be the only dlc I will not purchase for FF14.  They are starting to put out narratives in their games that never needed to be there in the first place. One example for me is ff6. The original game had the story point where Celes is being beaten by soldiers from the Gestahlian empire where then Locke shows after that and and saves her. They are not glorifying the attacks on women but its to play at your heart strings.You naturally hate the empire since they are the antagonist but with just that one scene you have now invested your feelings and emotions into the characters fully and makes you want to continue to play so good can not just beat the empire but to destroy it completely. If i purchase this dlc it just goes to show square-enix that the changes they make are good ones and its ok to cut back on the story (my opinion). I miss the way those games were and how groundbreaking they became. It makes me sad where they are taking the company.

Think like a more preachy Jar Jar Binks. Wuk Lamat is a plague upon this expansion's writing. Everything revolves around her. Everything. Every conversation. Every cutscene. Every other character is a bland mouthpiece to shout words of encouragement toward her. I can't stress this enough. All the other characters, do nothing. If you were hoping for a character driven adventure through Tural, you will find nothing here for anyone other than Wuk Lamat. Even Krile and Erenville, who I was really looking forward to getting to know, have close to nothing to do other than be accessories to Wuk Lamat, giggling at her and scolding her as she has another bout of sea sickness or falls down another hole for the sake of ""comedy"". It is an absolute waste of potential.You, as the Warrior of Light, aren't even there to mentor her. Instead, you listen to other characters spout off platitudes about the power of friendship and how believing in yourself is important and then smile and nod. Smile and nod. She then will voice those same tired life lessons back to you, and you will smile and nod. You are not her mentor. You're just her errand boy/girl. If your idea of good character development is going from liking peace and acting like an idiot to liking peace and being less of an idiot, you're in for a good time. Oh yeah, and you're also installing this moralizing Naruto wannabe as the leader of an entire country for no discernible reason other than the fact that she's nice and two of the other candidates are cartoonishly evil villains. It's like someone at the SE headquarters accidentally dropped their preteen daughter's fan fiction where the final draft of the MSQ was supposed to be, and now we're all stuck playing through it. This is Wuk Lamat's world, and we're all just living in it.The plot is slow, as expected, but also written in the most uninteresting and infantilized way possible. Fresh start? New adventure? Nah. You play white savior to a tribe of bird people for a couple hours because they forgot how they harvest their crops every year, and their leader doesn't want to tell them. Don't worry savages, we're here to remind you of your own culture. We have ALWAYS, in EVERY expansion, been exposed to new cultures and peoples. Never before has an entire expansion had this much focus on that aspect of world-building and done it in such a simplistic and uninteresting way. There is one section that is decently written, and the rest are painfully amateurish. This is most of the MSQ until over halfway through where the writing gets more interesting but even less coherent.I won't spoil it, but the plot contrivances are massive and the pacing is god awful. There is no sense of urgency, and the tone is never consistent. And yes, Wuk Lamat is still hogging up 99% of the screentime with her god awful antics and childish platitudes in every scene. A villain with no intrigue or development is deus ex machina'd into the plot. The final zone has the potential to be interesting but is presented with absolutely no nuance. Never did I think I would be so bored and, at times, outright appalled by the questing and plot beats in the level 100 area of the game.Dawntrail is an absolute embarrassment for Final Fantasy XIV. This isn't just bad writing by their standards, but by JRPG standards. ARR has excellent world building. Heavensward has a beautiful self-contained plot. Stormblood has a great cast of fun and interesting characters. Shadowbringers has amazing character development and one of the best villains in the series. Endwalker has crazy plot beats and story revelations that come together in an emotionally resonate if a bit messy finale. Dawntrail has a catwoman Naruto-clone dragging you around to do menial tasks and preaching about the power of understanding that ends in the most nonsensical way possible. Dawntrail not only sucks as an expansion, but actively hurts the world-building and writing of what will come after. I am hoping YoshiP and his crew manage to salvage something out of this dumpster fire, but for the first expansion in this new arc...Dawntrail is a complete disappointment.",1720025717,311,9,negative

I also notice some cultural things not respected by the U.S. localization.   As a person from indigenous back ground I found somethings not respected in culture in some appearances. Which is forgivable and not a big deal. I think we can overlook that part and understand the main message the game was putting out. Gearing is another issue I have with FF14, nothing has improved in gearing and I feel like nothing will change in how we recieved our gearing or have optional ways of getting BiS. I may have to hit FFXIV forums about this topic.As far as everything I found DawnTrail kinda stuck in mid, the culture of things is that many indigenous people of that time did not have ""colorful hair"" and I found this is strange as how the world see's us westerners,  I felt this ""identity politics"" are being overplayed here in the shadows of things and its getting out of hand that we as gamers are tired of this. Also to mention that  I can say this that many indigenous cultures were very harsh and did bad things to their own people as a bad example (sacrificing rituals) and its gets pretty gruesome which I'm glad they did not added that bad stuff in DawnTrail.So far I give the story for the most part an 8 out 10, 0 being negative and 10 being positive. for a good effort and  I do encourage try to get Voice actors from those areas that Tural represents someone who is from Columbia or has indigenous roots that may give more expression and life into those specific new main characters that DawnTrail has given us. And my dislikes are a lot that I can not provide here on this review that I need to  go yo FFXIV forums for. I can not recommend this game to anyone yet until they work somethings out ingame.

If I completely set aside the new story which to be honest I really have to do in order to continue playing this game then the music is good, dungeons i've played so far are interesting and the new scenery is beautiful. The new combat changes and graphical updates are good too. Then we have Dawntrail msq...it's a shell of what it could have been, it's far too centred on the one character who is not likeable but throughout you are forced to fully support which is very grating when they're obnoxious. The story has made me feel like i've gone from being this incredibly epic hero in Endwalker to an air headed cheer leader for Wuk Lamat who is even more empty headed than I am (all of a sudden- like why am I just all of a sudden floating around not really caring about what I am doing anymore?) but hey at least we want world peace or something....more importantly look a butterfly yey! Wuk lets get you on a boat again it's sooooo funny when it makes you sick. Another thing why would the Eorzean champion, god slaying WoL get involved in foreign political affairs? Whoevers team we choose (hah no we don't really have a choice but lets pretend) we are giving a crazy advantage it's pretty much a guaranteed win since i'm unstoppable ....I reeeeally should not be taking sides like this. The fact i'm unstoppable is well known to everybody except all these new people i'm meeting so i'm also now lying by omission. I feel like a bad guy. I've been downgraded from hero to some sellsword who will do whatever she feels like because she's all powerful! so basically i'm no better than the new 'bad guy' they've introduced who uses purely his strength to get what he wants. Also zero immersion for me personally when the english voices are completely mis-matching what characters look like...aside from the obvious wuk VA what the heck was the sailors voice at the beginning on the boat about?? he sounded rough as hell like some old 65 yr old smoker pirate but he looked 20 kinda funny but too weird if you want an immersive experience. I've never been a story skipper in any of the previous expansions i've played but this one i'm rolling my eyes and skipping scenes regularly just to be able to level my character. I don't know if the story will get better...but atm it's just not doing it for me. I think honestly they would've been better off going on with a story including Zero from the previous expansion somehow. Or for gods sake let me choose who I want to support in Dawntrail like Koana would make way more sense to me. They need to bring back the previous writer/s and fix the voice acting pronto. I'm going to keep going with it to the end of this part because well i've paid for it and it's too late for me but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless I was going to suggest skipping and getting it all out of the way and just focusing on the game itself...but even then..probs still wouldn't. Edited to say I tried to finish it (got to a part where you have to play as Wuk Lamat in a crappy fight what a bloody surprise) but it's just a waste of time it sucks I hate it so i've moved onto other games it's genuinely upsetting because the gameplay is still great but the story was important to me and something I really enjoyed before.

Oblivion is one of my favourite games, where you play second man to the main character Martin Septim, so I don't have a huge issue with that. Its the quality of the writing where I take my umbrage in this expansion.You are constantly told things and never shown them, you're told a character has grown or you're told how skilled someone is at something, they make sure to tell you but rarely ever show you anything. Which is in stark contrast to how characters like Emet-Selch were written who we were told little about, but showed us how capable he was.Outside of that, we're constantly having the same things reiterated to us over and over again, such as the supposed character growth we're being told about. They aren't respecting their audience enough to expect them to understand these things and need to not only tell them, but reiterate it over time and time again. It gets incredibly tiring.Beyond that, old tropes are used but with a very surface level understanding, its like the people heading this expansion saw what was done in Heavensward, the idea of resolving issues and having people cooperate but entirely tossed aside the nuance of that, since in Heavensward it came with consequence, not everyone was actually happy and willing to cooperate, here that kind of conflict simply doesn't exist.We're expected to care about characters and a portion of the world we've barely been introduced to as if it was always somehow important, like we should be invested in this character they're trying to build up and care about these people we really don't know or have connections with and do a terrible job of actively trying to create that connection, its done with a bare bones effort and is almost a mockery of the writing quality that came before this. Outside of that, not only do really obvious plot points happen you can see coming from a million miles away, but the villains never succeed because they're smart. Instead the current writers somehow think by making our characters behave and do the most stupid things possible, which enables the villain. The villain is now somehow both capable and smart. We simply become stupid for the convenience of the plot.Another gripe I have with the writing is that characters will suddenly gain character traits essentially maybe half an hour before we're shown why this character trait, they supposedly have the entire time, justified how they were behaving even if their behaviour before that point provided absolutely ZERO indication to this other than the one occasion where they're trying to convince you this was their motivation and an aspect of them the entire time. You're shown their villainy and bad actor behaviour, until a few moments before they want you to be sympathetic rather than having that sympathetic aspect always having been hinted towards.I unlike many others wasn't a massive fan of Endwalker, I didn't enjoy how rushed and poorly paced and cheap the attempts at emotional moments were in some parts. But I still enjoyed Endwalkers story ultimately, the characters felt like themselves rather than shades of themselves being used to attempt to breed familiarity. While I wasn't a fan of Endwalker, especially as opposed to Shadowbringers, I could see there were positive aspects of the storytelling, for the gripes I had with it, certainly not bad enough for me to leave a negative review, unlike here.The second half of the expansion kind of comes out of nowhere with minimal but obvious build up. The quality of the writing independent of the annoying cat woman has gone thoroughly down the gutter and playing through it is an incredibly frustrating experience.As for the mechanics, they're top notch. High quality, I couldn't have asked for more. Music and environments are similarly wonderfully handled, but those aspects don't make up for the dog water writing in this expansion.

Some freak steps on my tacos? Let me SAY something, DO something rather than watch my new 'friend' (I hate her) say 'sticks and stones, stuff like this happens to me all the time anyway'(?!?!?)That's not even touching on the voice acting, XIV is one of the few JP games that you can tell a lot of effort went into it's english voices. But the cherry on the cake here is that this stupid fucking cat that you have attached to you like a tumour has some of the worst voice acting in the game. I'm sure there's some no named NPC what was voiced poorly in 2.0 or whatever I'm forgetting about, but they sure as hell weren't glued to you for a full expac! The JP voice is much MUCH better, and the rest of the cast is by no means worse than the english ones, but it feels wrong after 'getting to know' everyone as their english ones, I'll probably bite the bullet and switch sometime soon.I'm looking at the rest of the story like I'm staring down the barrel of a loaded gun, I've looked up to see if it gets better and I've got a lot longer to 'enjoy' my new '''friend'''. I'm saying this as a long time fan of the game, this is probably the least I've ever liked the story, even going back to 2.0, and it's not even close.... I wrote way too much. To finish, zones look nice, picto is really fun (viper is brain dead but flashy), the dungeon I've done is fun and I'm sure all the combat is going to be of the same standard, the game would be a pretty solid 8/10 if Wuk drowned on the ship over, but instead I feel like clubbing myself over the head with a brick.Wuk my balls.EDIT: I finished it somehow... spoilers, I guess...There's just way to much to go over, Wuk's really only the tip of a massive shitty narrative iceberg. All the combat stuff wasn't as good as I was hoping, the first trial was ok, the other two are pretty meh, dungeons dropped off around the same time. The way they handled solution 9 was a travesty considering how good Sphene was as a character and an actor. Having Sphene and Wuk acting and speaking in the same scene was like watching Ian Mckellen and Neil Breen sharing a script, I was actively rooting for her in the end, after we murdered all of her people and all that. Of course Wuk ends up ruining that too... Idk man if I didn't have a house I'd be unsubbing, I'm sure they'll try their best to unfuck it with patches, but I hope they handle it well, like I want Sphene to come back in some personable form (the lizard baby can't run a kingdom) but Wuk needs to go in a much more visceral form than Lyse did.",1719988892,319,26,negative

After this singular moment it really encapsulated my frustration with this entire 7.0 MSQ storyline. I really dont mind being second fiddle and just advising a new main cast but there were some moments in this storyline where we were so incredibly inept to the point of the story leaving a bad taste in my mouth that culminated in this event with again a specific 1 headed lizard. Maybe ill like how it ends but as it is right now I absolutely despise the story just because we are being so lackadaisical in these moments of martial prowess where we should absolutely step in and stop the evil shit that is happening from happening.

76561198082792831,639497,4086,english,"This review will have spoilers for the Expansion if you care, so don't read on if you don't want to be spoiled.[h1]The Good[/h1] The Last 30% of the Story: The story felt genuinely gripping in the last parts. Everything post Cowboy, starting with the Vanguard Dungeon up to the final boss battle i was very invested. The characters all felt great, and Wuk Lamat even had a few moments i enjoyed from her. I think if the expansion kept this the entire way through, it'd be better. Atleast i have higher hopes for post MSQ to continue this hype.The Battle Content: It's all pretty damn good. Every single dungeon, excluding the first one, i thoroughly enjoyed. The challenge feels good, and especially the last two post MSQ dungeons feeling more difficult than an average dungeon. I feel like they nailed most encounters on the head with difficulty, mechanics and unique fights, especially after the lackluster Post-MSQ of Endwalker. Trial wise feels good too, the Trial 2 and 3 feeling great and 1 feeling, okay but a bit like filler. The Class Changes: For the most part they all feel pretty good, or atleast look good. I haven't heard much complaint from most people, or atleast that most are Neutral, i'll list the one case which i think is bad below, but from the classes i've played, they've felt great.The Areas- I think most of these are a pretty big hit, especially in the latter half of the expansion. The areas are gorgeous and although some feel a little bit same-y (the western-style area feeling quite bland and forgettable) i think overall i enjoyed them. Solution 9 is a massive step up to Radz-at-Han.Bakool Ja Ja: I loved his redemption in the story, and the massive flip of a coin from him being a general dickhead to him just being troubled, with an awful spoiled upbringing. I think i really enjoyed what his character became, although i wish he was brought up more in the story. Characters reacting more to his change, and him needing to prove to people he wasn't the brute he was before.[h1]The Bad[/h1] The first 70% of the Story: The first 70% of the expansion is absolutely horrendous, equally as bad as some parts of ARR or Early Stormblood. Early ARR has the excuse of being a different time, less experience, and the weight of 1.0 entirely on its back. It was also responsible for the immense worldbuilding of the game. For Dawntrail this is also true, it being a new era of the game, Post Hydie and Zodie-arc as the new expansion to introduce the next segment of our story. However even with now years of writing under their belts, it's so poorly donWuk Lamat: *close up shot of her fist clenching* Annoying. Incompetent. Forced down our throats for the entire expansion and even after her annoyingly forced multiple character arcs are over, she still shows up to steal the spotlight over and over. I wouldn't mind if they made her character better, but it's just not. Most of her growth feels strange, and very lopsided. One moment she's feeling worthless but then after two words she never looks back to that ever again until it's brought up later, but she brushes it off.  The Voice actor is sub-par and really shows a lackluster performance next to the other Scions she's so constantly put beside. Most people recommend using JP acting just for this, but even then i find Wuk Lamat to be annoyingly forced upon every single scenario. This is further exasperated because of...The Warrior of Light: Useless. We're turned into this floppy bystander who is useless as absolute sin. The writers clearly didn't know how to handle our power level in this so they turned us into a braindead puppet. So many times we're forced to sit and watch as something awful unfolds and instead of stepping in and doing something we just watch with our mouth agape like it's something new. Watching Zoraal Ja murder his father as we sit there, watching the entire time even before being told not to, and then just letting him walk away because...we're braindead i guess? It's awful. Many other times problems could be solved by just jumping into action but instead sitting there drooling on ourselves. I'd atleast forgive it if they did these things when we aren't around, like the Blue Roegadyn guy getting backstabbed away from us. But instead of all this happening while we were in Cowboy town, they make it happen after instead of during, which makes zero sense.The Filler Cowboy Arc: After dealing with Wuk Lamat the entire expansion, we finish her dawnservanting things and get to explode an area with Erenville, an NPC who i enjoy, but never got to do much in the first like 60% of this expansion. We get to an area that is extraordinarily boring, with a story and plot point that serves no purpose. The characters are boring that they introduce until they re-hash a problem from Shadowbringers, even referencing it themselves. The Train characters are...okay, the Hrothgar carrying with his voice acting, but every single character involved in the Sheriff/Deputy/Guy with friends wrongfully jailed feels bad. The entire idea behind it is also just...bad. The final parts with the train are..fine, and beefing up the train was cool, but it felt so awful and pointless. Very forgettable area.Otis: Why. you introduce an amazing character, with amazing voice acting. and then IMMEDIATELY waste him. You fight him in a cool fight, he comes back to our side, then DIES TO A RANDOM NOTHINGBURGER LIGHTING DOG MOB PROTECTING SOMEONE WHO IS INVINCIBLE ANYWAYS AND CAN JUST TELEPORT TO A NEW BODY. THE CHILD WHO HE WAS PROTECTING BARELY CARES HE DIED, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING TO REMEMBER HIM BY. Eventually you come across him later in the endless afterlife and he doesn't remember you until you tell him after some play thing, in an ATTEMPT to redeem him and make him feel better but this is all pointless anyways because they didn't do anything useful with an actual good character anyways. Glad he died for absolutely nothing. Would've been actually cool if he showed up in the 2nd trial and died there atleast doing something, maybe protecting the kid from his abusive father like he failed to do the first time. [h1]The Ugly[/h1] Summoner: Summoner is by far the worst class for new things this expansion. They got two upgrades and a """"""new"""""" Bahamut form at level 100. They barely had anything to say about the class, even though Endwalker left it in a troubled state post rework. It's boring. They gave it a great class personality and wonderful things, but made it so boring, that it's barely a caster. It has no depth besides holding Festers for Searing Light, and a a New Bahamut is absolutely boring as hell. It doesn't do anything new, and feels like the only class that genuinely got shafted. Like they forgot about it a month before Endwalker release.The Unlost World: A Beautiful area made into a wasteland via the story. They did the opposite of this in Endwalker, but was done well. Here, if you want to go back to any of these areas you have to go back to NG+ to experience anything beautiful there. Doing it post MSQ for a dungeon, and Fates makes the area feel...ugly. I get the idea was that you destroyed and ended it all, but i desperately hope they do something with bringing it back to it's beauty in post MSQ or maybe a beast tribe, because as of now it looks just awful.2nd Dye Channels: I really really am disappointed with a lot of these. Not with what they chose, but with what they made dyeable on some pieces. Lots of pieces randomly have teeny tiny parts made dyeable, despite better choices existing. It's insulting to see some of the choices they made like the Adventurer's Jacket or Fat Cat Pajamas. I hope this gets improved in the future. (i know about the whole dye regions/texture limits and what not people mention, but these could clearly be updated and fixed around for pieces with awful choices.)First 70%: 2/10Last 30%: 7.5/10Trials/Dungeons/Combat: 9/10Overall: 4.5/10",1719983927,7,0,negative

No this isn't about our main character - it doesn't have to be. Nor does there have to be any stakes. Just make it interesting. The second half of the main story is interesting but also just dragged out or stopped in its tracks because they have to shove in Wuk Lamat's sob story or fetch quests as usual (just more dragged out which makes them feel even worse)On the other hand you have great gameplay on hand where dungeon and boss design is incredible compared to previous expansions. They are more challenging and very varied, music is really good as well.

Personally, I didn't mind ARR, HW, or SB. Everything after that seems to be on a steep downhill trend with Dawntrail being a vertical line down instead of a slope.I know we're currently in a state where the ""big bad"" is gone and we need to pivot the story in another direction but... you're not even the main fucking character. Yes, the Warrior of Light - Saviour of several worlds, slayer of Gods, bringer of peace and destruction now relegated to being a side character to a furry with the most irritating voice I've ever heard in a video game. And I've played FF12 multiple times. Yes, ""it"" is worse than Vaan by astronomical units.## Class ChangesTo give some context, I've been playing this slop for 10 years so I do remember how ARR/HW played.Once again, healers are carbon copies of each other with very few distinguishing characteristics. AST got shafted again, somehow, and the others are just as dull as they were last expac.Tanks, once again, are all carbon copy Warrior clones so you're not missing anything there.I can't speak for most of the DPS classes as I've not leveled them yet. However, BLM, once again, got basically nothing. Remember when we got Despair and it turned out to be just another generic combo ender? Well in Dawntrail you get... another generic combo ender. They also screwed mana regeneration on BLM. They also removed Sharpcast from BLM because juggling procs is too hard for the average person, apparently.As for the new classes, Viper is dragoon and Pictomancer runs on a priority system similar to classes like MCH/BRD when they were actually fun to play.So, all in all, you got mostly nothing from this expac except the number next to your level was increased by 10.## Battle ContentAs usual from SE, this expac is just like every other expac after ARR. You get a dungeon every odd level, you get 2 trials during the campaign, you unlock 2 dungeons and 2 Extreme trials after the campaign.It's been nearly a decade since HW launched and this company can't seem to shake up anything except lower your expectations.## Other ContentThere is no other content.You can level your DoH/DoL just like every other expac after SB - spam turn ins for scrips, maybe do your GC dailies, etc.## Overall/Final CommentsThis expansion is version 7.0. It's been 5 expacs since ARR was a thing and this company is still putting this game out on a schedule that's almost a decade old. As noted previously, every expac after HW seems to homogenize the roles even more. Job identity has been thrown out the window in pursuit of streamlining everything into carbon copies. I've been maining BLM since HW and the class hasn't fundamentally changed. I created an alt character to main healer roles in Savage raids and they've homogenized ALL the healers to a point where it's just not fun to press the same button for 90% of any content. I can't even get excited for my favorite tank, DRK, because I remember how much fun it was to play before it became a WAR clone.This game isn't taking any risks. It's not innovating. It's not doing anything new. It's the same stale crap with a new wrapper. The only risk SE is taking is letting a transwoman voice the main character in this expansion since you're just being carted around on someone else's story. A boring, bland fucking story. I can't name a single boss in Dawntrail because they were all so fucking unremarkable.",1719961917,11,0,negative

76561198024693330,0,0,english,"This is the review I least wanted to post, but after finishing the story, I felt it was necessary. This will be an ongoing review and I will update this likely after 7.3 and 7.5. This is a very, VERY mid expansion at best. There are definitely some good things about this expansion, but the bad vastly outweighs it in my opinion. Let's start with the good. The dungeons and trials are arguably some of the best the game has ever had. A perfect mix of spectacle and difficulty mixed with an amazing soundtrack really keeps you hyped up through the entire time. The zones are (mostly) beautiful. The graphical update really makes everything look so much better and I really enjoyed marveling at all the new textures and lighting effects. The music is also (mostly) good. Soken rarely misses with his tracks, but some don't quite hit the mark, but i'll get to that soon. The role quests are also really enjoyable, but that may be just because it gave me an excuse to leave behind the MSQ for a bit. Now on to the bad. The story is, for lack of a better word, bad. At best, it felt like I was playing through a long chain of side quests, and at worst, a poorly written, self-insert fanfic. I genuinely believe that this stems from the change of Main Scenario writers that happened after EW. I'm fully aware that more often than not, a writer change after finishing a major story can be good to bring fresh eyes to the story going forward, but this didn't feel like a good move here. And before people say I rushed or skipped cutscenes, no. I watched every single cutscene and played through every dungeon and trial that I could with NPC's to keep myself immersed. The story just wasn't good. Wuk Lamat was a fun character at first that felt like a shonen anime protagonist, but the more time I spent listening and interacting with her, the less I liked her. Her character growth happened early and she never really grew after that. She was the epitome of every boring shonen anime trope rolled into one character. Family and friends are her power and everyone is her family/friend. I want to like her, I really do, but I just don't. Unfortunately, she's not even the worst character of the expansion. Zoraal Ja and Soreel Ja are arguably the biggest wasted characters. I won't say much without spoilers, but the ""twist"" with these characters was only shocking because of all the lost potential. Also, you remember when everybody was excited to find out about Krile's past and see how she grows as a character? Yea, that mostly happens off screen. She definitely got more screen time, but mostly in weird ways, like giving her an Echo vision just for her to tell us that Zoraal Ja is super emo. Not what I would call character growth if you ask me.I mentioned some of the music being subpar before, so let's touch on that. Some of the music, specifically the music used at the end of the Succession Rite and after defeating the final boss during Erenville's monologue, just feels very out of place. It has a weird Lion King/Jungle Book vibe that just doesn't fit. Sure it sounds victorious in a way, but it also just doesn't sound like it has a place in this expansion. I will end this by saying that I genuinely hope that this is just a Stormblood situation where the story is mid (although I really liked the Stormblood story) and the combat and post-MSQ stuff will carry it, but for now, this ranks at the bottom of my FFXIV list. I genuinely enjoyed ARR more than I did this expansion so far, and I hate saying that. If you did enjoy it, I'm super happy for you that it struck your fancy. For me, I cannot recommend it at all if you enjoyed any of the FFXIV story so far.",1719958755,465,10,negative

76561198038902385,0,0,english,"The first half of the game was poorly paced, and the second half was poorly executed, with sporadic writing throughout. The characters are neither as enticing as in previous expansions, nor are their motivations well-established. I find it interesting when the Scions interject in the dialogue with, ""Hmm, wait a minute. I was thinking that if you do this, won't you just be doomed to fail?"" Meanwhile, the antagonist of whichever storyline would just scoff and simply say, ""Whatever, bro.""Good writing is characterized by several key elements that enhance clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. In past expansions, relevance and depth were key points that established why the characters would act in a certain manner. This expansion maintains that in a very sporadic manner. Some antagonists do have their motivations and reasoning, but they lack sophistication. They act like toddlers, which is strange given that previous antagonists all had some sort of reason for their actions. Even in the 6.x patches, the characters had this basic fundamental.I see a lot of reviewers pointing out that this isn’t Endwalker; it’s a new chapter, etc. But tell me, when an author of a book changes their writing style, appeals to naivety, and references the previous expansions poorly, why is this given a pass? This isnt ARR, which is funny because the narrative of ARR builds upon the events of 1.0. Characters who survived the Calamity often refer to the past events and their experiences during the original game's timeline. Scattered throughout the world of ARR are memorials and remnants of the original game. These serve as in-game acknowledgments of the past and the transition to the new era.  Why cant it be done here? This new chapter in our adventure? I won't continue to explain why the expansion is a bad addition, but when I talked with someone else, they brought up an interesting point. This isn't XIV for those who played the game and waited for the expansion. This is XIV for those who are new and have completed the story and crave more content. I can see that being a valid case. However, the characters and the story itself are too poor. It's as if you were served a five-star meal and then given a two-star appetiser. For us, we were waiting a while for the five-star appetiser. Instead, we got something moldy and uncooked. Which is to say, this is a 2/5 for me.",1719956653,15,0,negative
76561198027235941,0,0,english,"I'm writing this review just as I finished the final MSQ, so I am probably going over / missing a few things; I am writing all this while the experience is still fresh.At risk of repeating other most-voted reviews for this expansion, Dawntrail for me is the biggest disappointment in the XIV franchise so far.Without delving into spoilers, the overarching story & narrative of this expansion can be summarized with the word of ""slop"". I have always played XIV for the story & plot that has been robust over the years (even with weaker entries such as Stormblood), but never has it reached the abysmal level that even I am skipping cutscenes for the first time in my XIV history.The first half of Dawntrail's story is mind-numbingly boring with genuinely 0 interesting characters or any worthwhile developments - to call it a ""necessary lore dump"" because it's the start of a new story arch is immeasurable cope. For hours on end, you are doing nothing more than running from A to B, listening to Wuk Lamat talk about how she respects people and wants peace, you kill 1 quest enemy, then rinse & repeat for 20 hours. Other reviews have already pointed out how Wuk Lamat is a comically bad character from a writing standpoint, rightfully earning her the Mary Sure title (something that other characters are vying for in this expansion.)At risk of potential spoilers, the antagonists of Dawntrail's story are no better than the main character (which is not the player, mind you, but one of the worst written characters I've had the displeasure of having to see). The second antagonist is marginally better, but still lacks any interesting or redeeming qualities, going so far as to feel like the male equivalent of a Mary Sue, going from 0 to 100 power in a matter of 1 quest. (If you know, you know)Without going into too much detail, the final part of the story serves no purpose and feels like nothing more than a time waster - 6th zone & it's story could be cut from the expansion and nothing would change. To summarize the story & narrative aspect of Dawntrail, I genuinely believe after 3000-ish hours of playtime that this is the worst written, lowest quality, least interesting *slop* that has somehow managed to see the light of day. This is not to say that Dawntrail only has negative aspects - both the leveling and high-level dungeons, and trials are refreshingly enjoyable to run, seemingly achieving the wanted ""middle-level"" difficulty between an AFK-run and an extreme trial. The mechanics (a lot of which are reskins / reused, mind you) are enjoyable to play with, and provide just enough difficulty to provide a healthy challenge without going too far into sweat territory. To wrap up a mostly negative review - the characters & story is nothing but a shadow of it's former self, but the gameplay side of the expansion does bring welcome additions to the game.",1719956514,17,1,negative

But then also people basically know who she is and that she is competing on sight?

There are opportunities where the story can take an exciting route but it often fails to do so. Additionally, I feel 'forced' to like certain characters and it just doesn't work.

The music, visuals, and locations are some of the best in the game.For years, SE has been getting away with endless amounts of filler and padding in the main story due to excellence in other areas. Heavensward, Shadowbringers, and Endwalker all had very well-written and entertaining plots which made the shitty pacing and quest design tolerable.The 20+ hour main story (which you'll be forced to trudge through before being able to enjoy other content) is nothing special, but is so horrifically paced that it will overshadow whatever positive experiences you have. The tedious, unending, redundant dialogue just never stops. Every time you get invested in a story or excited for what happens next, the writing team hits the brakes to send you on boring pointless meandering for an hour. Wuk Lamat overstays her welcome and just never ceases to talk over other characters and hijack their storylines. There are signs here that this expansion wanted to do something new. However, the writers seemingly got cold feet and completely re-used and ripped off ideas from Shadowbringers once they realized how boring their story was. SE refuses to take the risk of stepping significantly out of their cookie-cutter expansion model; it's worked very well in the past but simply did not mesh with whatever they wanted to accomplish with Dawntrail.

76561197985745875,551957,3654,english,"TL;DR: Stormblood 2: Electric Boogaloo.I must update this review to better reflect a proper review rather than a spot on meme, but review in progress until 7.58 comes out.While I've learned that this is the product of a new writing team.The tonal shift for the story is so jarring when put into comparison of the previous two expansions, Endwalker and Shadowbringers; both expansions excelled well because it gave the WoL, player character, actual personality. Shifting the player's position within the storytelling from a sidelines character like in ARR, Heavenward and Stormblood to the center stage main character within the story. I was hoping that while Dawntrail was expected to be relatively low stakes, you know summer vacation after saving the world. I was expecting a light-hearted fun romp through the Main Scenario Quests, but not this.Dawntrail's story has done the complete opposite tonal shift, and it does not do it well. It could've been executed better, but the jarring shift of the Warrior of Light character from main character back to side character is the biggest note that this expansion type is returning, probably what was seen as the 'safest route' at the time since everyone has to cut their teeth when working on a MMO with a core foundation in story, to the roots of the storytelling. This is the Warrior of Light's summer vacation, but you're no longer the main character. You've been sidelined to probably the goofiest furball of shonen anime tropes that I've ever seen. It's not even the good tropes that make shonen anime characters memorable, it's all of the bad ones. Not one ounce of Wuk Lamat is redeemable at this point, unless there's a severe story shift for her story at the start of the Post Main Scenario Quests that should be starting up in 7.1.Truly the first time I've ever had a mixed feeling on the overall story, no spoilers, but while it is the longest slow burn to start it picks up fairly quickly, encounters a slight stall to pad out the story while introducing the most stereotypical american tropes, and then overstays it's welcome near the end. New dungeons are fantastic, environments have never looked this good in any expansion for FFXIV previously. The new Trials are very interesting and mechanically sound, I think there's been a slight random number generator applied to bosses for when to use their abilities. They truly feel randomly applied rather than following a mindnumbing scripted sequence of execution as in previous expansions. I love it. I'll edit this once I've experienced the new raid.New classes are great, but have downsides. Two red dps classes means that there's a low population count of people playing blue dps or green dps so queues are much longer for duty finder, but this should even out fairly quickly. While I haven't played Viper myself yet, all of it's abilities make it seem like it's a very fast combo oriented class.Pictomancer, however, is my new main job for FFXIV going forward. It is a fantastic blend of high damage numbers from Black Mage, support abilities from Summoner, and utility of Red Mage. It is the most interesting caster job in FFXIV to date, and I hold it highly because it's so comically, and beautifully executed both in class lore, spell animations, and mechanics. You have your long cast ability, whether it's the combo that cycles through fire, aero and water abilities to generate white paint so you can use a AE ability, and adds paint to the meter so you can use subtractive palette to grant access to 'darker colors' to deal even more damage through a combo rotation of ice, earth, and thunder magic. There's motifs that are long cast spells in combat, and instant when outside of combat that prep you to use your power 'drawing' spells, the bonk hammer is amazing. I recommend Pictomancer to anyone who has been put off by the other selection of casters within the game. Oh, and there's moogles that fire laser beams from their faces.Do I recommend Dawntrail? Not really, it's definitely on the low end of my list but I am of the player base that didn't like Stormblood all that much either. Unless you fancy to have a trip through Tural with Furry Jar Jar Binks. There's one character that is introduced as an antagonist early on, and I hope that the Post-MSQs focus on that character more than Wuk. I'd love more interaction with him.",1719936455,110,12,negative

76561197996955276,0,0,english,"In this expansion, the main plot is based around a character with a very specific and polarizing, well, character. Everything in the story is linked to them in every way, shape and form, including your own WoL's reactions and attitudes which are also set in stone. If you manage to resonate with that character, you will have a genuinely great time. If, for some reason, you don't really feel this character, the entire expansion has nothing else for you to latch onto in terms of storytelling - everything relies on you accepting that everyone around, including the WoL, unconditionally loves the character.There was a specific scene in the 94-95 level range which made me interested in a different character. For all intents and purposes, that character was a punk, and we learn about the reasons, and these reasons made me think of them in an entirely new light. I understood the pressure and responsibility they had and why they did the things they did. Sadly, my WoL gets dialogue options that simply shit on that character, and these reactions just exist for the previously mentioned polarizing character to show us the power of friendship, which instantly turn the flawed character into the most loyal and best friend, within a single cutscene, all with the power of talk. That's a running theme actually - issues are introduced just to be resolved instantly with talk-no-jutsu, very often in the same quest. I really wish this expansion was about lower stakes and the WoL being in the background enjoying not directly partaking in world-ending situations, but instead the stakes aren't really believeable (but according to characters in-game they're very important) and WoL, by being around The Character, is still directly involved in these situations.they did make a dungeon with a boss that uses e4s mechanics tho so that's pog",1719927554,14,1,negative

In terms of encounter design, this is the best base-expansion so far; all of the dungeons are high quality as well. Everything reeks of effort, and you can feel the developers flexing their 10 years of experience in every fold of its design. This applies to everything—except, unfortunately, the story.It's a very unusual experience for me to come away from an FFXIV expansion launch impressed by everything except the one thing I expected to be impressed by. If you don't care about the story, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this expansion. However, if the story is the primary draw for you, then you can probably sit this one out.I didn't expect the story to match the highs of ""Shadowbringers"" or ""Endwalker,"" but I had at least expected ""Heavensward/Stormblood"" quality. Yet, what I got was a story that struggled to compare even to the mediocrity of ""A Realm Reborn."" Every part of the story and storytelling felt amateurish and uninspired. All the subtlety of the previous expansions' writing seems to have left alongside Ishikawa. Characters will look directly into the camera and explain themselves, multiple times. I'm unsure if this sudden twist on the old ""show, don't tell"" wisdom is because the writing team collectively forgot how writing works, or whether they think I'm a cognitively maladapted troglodyte incapable of understanding implication or subtext. Either way, writing of this poor quality is not what I've come to expect from this development team.The traditional cast of characters is all here, yet all of their complexity and personality have been unceremoniously stripped away. This is fine, I suppose, considering none of them had the requisite screen time necessary to explore their characters anyway. ""Dawntrail"" sacrifices everyone and everything for the sake of giving Wuk Lamat more screen time, a baffling decision considering how much of a non-character she is. If you don't love Wuk Lamat, which admittedly some people do, then this expansion has nothing in terms of story to offer you. Besides, of course, a final villain with a philosophy so vacuously grandiloquent it feels written specifically to imply something profound is being said, while desperately hoping you don't think too much or too critically about it, lest it shatter under the mildest reflection or scrutiny.This is the only MSQ, ARR included, from which I came away having enjoyed no part. At least ""Stormblood"" had its moments, as did ARR, but ""Dawntrail's"" story offers me nothing: mediocre at best, 2009 YouTube machinima without the charm of novelty at worst. The only way I can explain what the ""Dawntrail"" story is like is to imagine ""Stormblood"" without Kugane/Doma, Azim Steppe, Sadu, Magnai, Hien, Yotsuyu, Zenos, or Fordola. It's just Lyse, being duct-taped to you for 30+ hours straight. If you *really* love Lyse, that might sound appealing. If you're planning on playing ""Dawntrail,"" you better pray to God you end up *really* Loving Wuk Lamat, because if not, you'll be in for an experience that will redefine your understanding of the term ""obnoxious.""And yet, with all this being said, I can't help but still be optimistic for the future. I love this game and always will, and I have full confidence the team will learn from this failure, or at the very least, fire the lunatic responsible for this abomination of an MSQ.",1719926682,13,0,negative

So now the strongest thing in this expansion is Wuk Lamat. Excluding the drama about VA and all that crap. This character is poorly written and fleshed out regardless of growth over the expansion. The main driver is that the individual believes they can achieve peace through resolving everything via boring you with (fetch quests, being secondary, hanging out with them 24/7, listening them to solve problems and forgiving people for serious crimes.) Here's the most common example I can think of ahead in the story with spoiler tags.[spoiler]Take Bakool Ja Ja who releases the van bird in trial 1, he gives you a sob story of why he's such a piece of shit and then everyone goes from kill this fool to i forgive you bro"".

This story is borderline hot crap, i mean a real dookie on the pavement, having done the pre-release i was extremely hype for this, but i found myself contemplating on quitting the game over how garbage the beginning of it was. By almost all standards this was one massive beast tribe quest. I had more engagement and interest in ARR then i did this expansion as far as the story goes. Please tell me again why the main character is goddamn Wuk Lamat, like every. goddamn. cut scene. had this dumb annoying terrible VA character in it and i found myself skipping dialogue at times because i could already guess what she was going to say. The only redeeming part of the story was anytime that we were about to do a dungeon/trial, every other part was a fetch quest/filler.Another issue is classes, this has been a on going issue with almost every expansion, every expansion the classes become more and more of a snooze fest, tanks are absolutely in a abyssal state rn with their abilities being the most boring simple thing ever, dps rotations are becoming almost as easy as a tanks. Now as far as healers go this might get me in hot doodoo with the community but they have no room to complain, the dungeons minus the first one had very hard and punishing raid wides, and as a dps main i dont pay attention to my health, so if im noticing my health going down then yeah its getting a bit freaky.My biggest concern/disdain for the state of the game currently however is the condition of the game for new players, im talking people starting in ARR, we've got 5 whole expansion after ARR that new players HAVE to go through in order to get to good content, i get it, its a final fantasy game, the story is going to be very important, however the average person does not want to sit through hundreds on hundreds of hours of dialogue just to get to good/current content. Not allowing new players to start at a expansion that is meant to be a completely new start for the game is very concerning, if they keep this up the game will not last.Overall i'd rate this a 7/10, the gameplay is amazing, the map design is amazing, the graphics are a massive improvement, and the fights are badass. However with the state of the game in regards to story, and its focus on new player experiences it couldn't be at a worse point currently.",1719910732,14,0,negative

The character writing needs improvement because alot of the new characters introduce feels forced inserted. I know this is a new storyline but its lacking in what made ARR to EW (6.0) not (6.1 to 6.5) Main story quest good. Gameplay for the new Dungeons and Trials are very well done they bring something interesting, and new to the table that is quite enjoyable and fun. If the story doesn't invest you to what they trying to bring, atlest you may enjoy the dungeons and trials.Do I think the overall expansion is Bad?? No not really asides from the story that needed some improvements with character development and writing. I don't hate or dislike Wuk Lamat but her character writing is not very good. Put any other characters you like in her spot and I think you probably feel the same if they were in her spot.Do I recommend it? Honestly its gonna be preference based. What do you play the game for? That pretty much determine your answer. For me I would recommend it but it has alot of issues with the build up and progression of the new storyline.

Wuk can and does fail every step of the way without our help, so her ending up running a country due to our efforts feels worthless.The entire time you're either following her annoying ass around watching her talk at others and expecting you to do the work for her, or she's following you around like a parasite that Ivermectin couldn't kill off.This expansion is just boring.

76561197970890250,0,0,english,"The short version: Great dungeons and boss battles, but with a horrible story that both drags on and is rushed with horrible writing. If you pick this up, do yourself a favor and SKIP through the story and just read the cut scene summaries at the inn.The Good:The visuals are gorgeous. The graphics update is amazing.The class mechanics are smoothed out for the most part.The new classes are fun.The dungeon fights are a challenge now.Trials have brand new mechanics.Three expansions of story in one.What few action scenes there are, are really well done.The Bad:The main gameplay loop outside of instanced dungeons is a downgrade from the previous expansions. Back to lots of talking, with very few action scenes.Yoshi took the #HealerStrike personal. Bosses will have three or four mechanics launch at the same time. Getting hit by two is game over. The Warrior of Light meets Cup Head.Your character could be removed from the story and nothing would change.The story is in three parts: A tour of the new land, the people, and their culture based on South American history. An invasion from a ""foreign"" power for part 2. And... something out of an acid trip for the finale.The pacing is bad: over 2/3's of the story is spent on the first act. It is a slow, painful slog to get through it all.Then there are two entire expansion packs worth of story packed into the last 1/3 of the story. Characters are introduced, then act like they are best buddies, then stab you in the back, then die in an ""emotional"" scene in the same quest.The voice acting from the entire cast ranges from ""I'm here for the paycheck"" to ""oh god my ears!"" Honestly, AI voices would have been better 90% of the time.The Ugly:The story is horrendous.The overall story is about a girl boss whom everyone loves, can do anything, is the key to everything, and whose ""arc"" is learning she just needs to gain self-confidence in her girl boss powers. Slay queen, slay! Think Lyse from Storm Blood but way worse.And yes, you are side lined in your own story. The Warrior of Light goes from ""I eat gods for breakfast"" to ""I better stay out of this fight, I might get hurt!""The first part of the story is a tour of a land based on South America. SE was so afraid of the woke mob that they had ""consultants"" help. I looked them up, and the only Latin American experience they have is the drive thru at Taco Bell.So first part feels like a combination of someone pulling data points from Wikipedia, combined with what a Hollywood writer thinks about Mexico. And in typical Cali liberal fashion, it tries to avoid racism so badly that it loops back and becomes racist. The merchant clan all have big noses and are obsessed with profit! The culturally significant cuisine is Tex Mex. Whitey doesn't spice their food. etc.Add in the girl boss doing cute girl boss things, and boy howdy is the first act a boring slog.Then, people say things pick up in the second act. They are wrong. It is a barely disguised allegory for Western Colonialism. You literally have a ""technologically strong foreign power from the North"" that was built using slave labor and needs to exploit the 3rd world to survive, complete with a FREAKING BORDER WALL that you smash down with an Underground Railroad! Oh, did I mention the Trump stand in? Yes, we get TDS in this expac, complete with a J6 election denial allegory!And of course you join the communist ""rebel"" group to take the place down from the inside. While Girl Boss is being bestest ever buddies with the evil colonial leader at the same time! It makes no sense beyond ""the story has to have evil colonialists in it because West is bad.""And what would be an entire expansion's worth of lore is smashed into one zone. I'm kind of thankful for that, as there is less pain.""Surely things couldn't get worse in the 3rd act, right?"" Oh, how about literally deconstructing Heaven so you can fight Chat GPT! And yes, it comes out of nowhere. Literally beating the boss of the 2nd act, and everyone is like ""where'd character X go? Oh, must be in this AI generated afterlife in this space ship that crashed decades ago that we just learned about!"" Yes, it is that jarring. No, there is no further discourse on the issue. Just ""we beat Trump!"" to ""we have to beat up girl boss Jesus in the alien AI afterlife.""*head desk*In short, the story is hot woke garbage.",1719900273,18,2,negative

In fact you can pretty much only find positive opinions when it comes to one specific character now which was not the case less than a week ago. It's really just being used as an excuse to continue the trend of toxic positive and not accept true feedback. For the story, I don't mind it, and we're coming off some fantastic high-paced story content from Endwalker and Shadowbringer. I like taking a slower pace for an expansion, it feels like a return to ARR. I like the glam, the quests, the story, it's all fine so far and I'm excited for what new patches and expansions will bring. My only point of contention really is the horrible character we are bound to for the entirety of the story, it's not even the character really it's the fact that I have to play with the audio on mute. I disliked Minfillia's flat tone, but I would give anything to have Bolton back voicing Wuk Lumat instead of Bryer. They don't have any range, the accent is weird, and their poor voice acting stands out badly. I feel like I'm suddenly playing something straight off of Josh Strife Hayes 'Worst MMO's Series'. For a game that typically has fantastic casting with characters such as Venat, Graha, Estinien, Haurchefant (and the entirety of the Heavensward cast tbh), Zenos, Lyse, Papashan, Raubahn, etc, etc I could go on and on. This really is a weird casting choice for someone so central. To the point I wonder if they did ANY play tests with people who were not US loca employees. If it were a more minor character or a side character it would honestly have been a fine casting choice, but the amount and range the role requires, and how much we are interacting with them, really make the many flaws stand out. I hope they alter the voice in some way to make it bearable. I actually don't find fault with the character or any other voice acting in the expansion, which makes me miserable tbh because I still have to keep the rest of them on mute for my own sanity. Please leave this character out of all future work unless you make significant changes to that voice, even if it's just some sort of auto-tune.

This has nothing to do with ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" - this is straight-forward laziness. There is nothing even remotely interesting new going on in the crafting & gathering department. Battle system changes have made combat even more boring and streamlined.- Apart from the two post-MSQ dungeons, which introduce at least some new, fun mechanics, the instance fail to break out of the stale ""double-pull -> mini-boss -> double-pull -> mini-boss -> double-pull -> final boss"" scaffold. Missed opportunities and, again, laziness whereever one looks.- I have never seen so _little_ action going on in the main story quest.

76561198214592032,0,0,english,"I hate giving this a bad review, I really do. But it's a lot more of the same wrapped in what could possibly be the most boring storyline of the franchise, surpassing even Stormblood. To call it a ""slow burn"" is being generous; it's unintentionally comical how uninspired it is. I had my first concerns when the trailer's music had lyrics reminiscent of a children's Saturday morning cartoon show, only to be confirmed by how aggressively dull and irrelevant the MSQ is. For these reasons, since the story is the bulk of the expansion's content and the gameplay has received very little innovation, I give it a thumbs-down.Job updates are a very mixed bag, with healer mains seeming to be generally disgruntled and/or bored. I can't speak much on that from recent experience, but the healer subforum is worth a read to understand their woes. Seems a real shame, as I've long considered FFXIV healer jobs to be the most fun of any healer classes I've played in any other game, but I suppose the proof is in the pudding now that I just don't play them. However, as a RDM main, I'm pretty happy with the new 90-100 stuff, even if it doesn't expand heavily on the job's complexity. The addition of Grand Impact via Accession is the biggest winner for me.It's worth noting that this ""healer strike,"" while it may or may not be as prevalent as the vocal minority would have you believe, has *some* effect on the queue times for DPS, which at present are often atrocious. This is only compounded by the fact that both new classes are fighting for DPS spots too.The new dungeon/trial bosses are fun, but dungeons in general are more of the same. While that cookie-cutter format is to be expected, and I suppose I should judge based on their visual quality, the enjoyment I get from some of the game's presentation is marred heavily by how little I enjoyed the rest, propped up only by the mostly bangin' soundtrack, as usual.It just feels like some of the magic is gone. ""Maybe it's just me,"" I thought, but the reviews already posted here confirmed my hope that it wasn't. I mean, really, why did we even go to this continent whose name I fail to remember? Even with (and partly because of) the tedious world-building, I couldn't muster a care about Wuk Lamat, which led me to skipping nearly every cutscene before it even gets off the ground (moreso after realizing they almost never do). The worst offenses of the MSQ are the unskippable history lessons (there's even a quiz) and the sneak-behind quests which are, at least, thankfully short.  As mentioned in other negative reviews, the WoL and the Scions take so much of a backseat they may as well be off the bus, and in an attempt to get us acquainted with the star of the show and the culture of the continent, it turned into a long filler episode. Towards the end it gets flashier and more interesting, but that's a loooot of skipped cutscenes.Speaking of Wuk Lamat and unintentional comedy, I *did* watch the entire cutscene of her [spoiler]inviting the Warrior of Light outside to talk about something in private. I half expected some sort of awkward love interest, but instead was treated to a montage scene of the last couple hours of story, including something that happened just seconds ago, followed by her big reveal on how life-changing it's been. How old are you, and how long did that take you to realize? I had to put my controller down and have a bit of a sad chuckle to myself. It's not like she's lived in a particularly hostile social environment. Her character doesn't make much sense, and all of her supposedly emotional moments felt very... modern Disney.[/spoiler]My only intrigue at this point is the upcoming patch content, which will eventually include an Alliance raid based around FFXI's Vana'diel. But knowing me, I suspect it'll be too little too late to keep me justifying a sub. Devs, please listen to your community now that we have our hands on this expansion. Please phase out Wuk Lamat like you did Lyse, give healers the interesting rotations they deserve during their time *not* healing, and make the 7.x content worth the time we spent slogging through this desert of a story.",1719883469,11,0,negative

It's oversensitive, defensive, stagnant, and full of toxic people and drama and grooming etc. Everyone in this game is mentally ill in some form or other basically, and there's google doc leaks like every week on twitter, and lynch mobs form over the dumbest things.I'm addicted to gposing and htats literally the only reason I bother to pay my sub. The gameplay is bad, the story is mid (albeit not quite as absolute dumpster fire retconned mess as wow's), the netcode is archaic, and squeenix has no real innovation, and its players fail to provide any criticism or feedback that would lead to meaningful change or force the issue. If you're new and aren't already invested for some reason (friends or gposes or whateveR) just stay away.

76561198008690867,0,0,english,"When I got this expansion pack, I was hoping there'd be more Final Fantasy XIV Online.[hr]If you're buying this for the new MSQ, prepare to be disappointed if you want your WoL to take centre stage; the main scenario questline pretty much 99% resolves entirely around Wuk Lamat who's character and story for the most part reminds me of a worse copy of Stormblood's Lyse, if lets say she had instead been made more the sole primary focus of the story, ontop of both lacking any form of indepth development and growth to her character along with having far lower stakes that fail to fully justify what she gains as a character and for herself during the timespan of the expansion's MSQ. That's not to say that Wuk hasn't earned what she has gained but, given she pretty much completes her main goals by the time you are completing the level 94 MSQs, to me at least it felt as if her story is a bit undercooked, she pretty much stops growing as a character by this time too, despite the claims made by said character in dialogue during cutscenes.As for the WoL and returning cast they kind of have very little relevance to the story moving forward outside of Krile and Erenville; the story fails to establish any form of attachment or meaning for the WoL to even be present or involved, so far I feel as if my WoL is but a mere bystander or observer to what is unfolding. If anything it reminds me of how WoW does their ""stories"" in which for WoW the player character is entirely absent from cutscenes or has little to no involvement in things moving forward other than a minor mention; this isn't entirely the case for FFXIV: Dawntrail but it definitely stepped in that direction which is not a good sign.Simply put, it's incredibly mid at best, possibly worse than Stormblood's basegame MSQ overall. I do believe this is quite possibly the weakest expansion MSQ-wise we have had so far.[hr]For the dialogue and English voice-acting, the voice-acting is alright for the most part however for Wuk Lamat specifically seeing how she is essentially the main character for the expansion pack, the voice actor for Wuk Lamat did an okay job overall for the voiced scenes but comes across as very monotone/flat in some instances. I believe they could have done better but I'd chalk the shortcomings on the possibility that the voice actor was not given enough direction during certain segments. As for the dialogue for both voiced and non-voiced scenes, the quality seems to have been eroded somewhat in comparison to Endwalker, with certain elements straying into Stormblood's morally preachy themes albeit being more hamfisted and put out with far less grace but with also very little relevance to the player's own WoL or their party for the most part; as if the NPCs are simply saying, 'this is what I want', 'this is how things should be', 'this is what is right', without very little feedback from the player. Your WoL's agency as a character is greatly diminished as the passivity of the WoL has been increased a lot more, allowing other characters to take the initiative more often than not; but to also state or do things without consequence, as your WoL just stands there watching things happen, good or bad, instead of engaging and taking action right the way. The WoL has become for the most part in Dawntrail, incredibly almost purely reactive to a fault.Now, as for the gameplay side of things? I mean, it's alright. At least they've made normal dungeons not as boring as they were in Endwalker and the new trials are fun.As for the graphics update, it is good. Things look nicer for the most part, it's a step in the right direction.[hr]But to be fair, seeing how this is the start of a new 'arc' for FFXIV, this is a very rough start so far, especially if we compare this and every other new expansion pack to that of Shadowbringers and it's MSQ, which was pretty much the best thing since sliced bread. And before anyone decides to go ahead and mention ""But A Realm Reborn"" or even bother comparing ARR to DT, ARR was a brand new game and back then had a different design approach and a different set of design goals. DT is merely an expansion pack and can take advantage of the newer design approaches and goals that CBU3 has for FFXIV. Yes, 'A Realm Reborn' was a slog at parts and it was very long, but it had to do a shed load of world-building amongst other things; Dawntrail isn't an entire brand new start for the WoL or the returning cast, or even the world of FFXIV, it is built upon the foundations of what came before it, so it at least has a solid starting point that ARR generally didn't have, especially since the New World has been talked about in FFXIV before Dawntrail entered production. Dawntrail being a 'brand new arc' is not a valid excuse for this expansion not walking out the gates with a stride and not avoiding fluffy sloggy story-telling; especially due to Shadowbringers, with that expansion having to world-build the entirety of The First ontop of everything else which is impressive what they pulled off; lightning in a bottle? Probably.So since they've already showed us what they are capable of with Shadowbringers; it's safe to say that Dawntrail's start is lacklustre which is only made worse with the pacing and tempo being very inconsistent, dragging on a lot due to the amount of fluff jammed into the MSQ; the main selling point of the expansion pack for a lot of people. Which was a problem at the start of Endwalker's MSQ too for some players, myself included. However, Endwalker's MSQ was like that of a snowball getting bigger and faster, as it gained momentum going down the hill, accelerating as it headed for the finish line. Dawntrail's MSQ seems to just not know what kind of pacing it wants to go at.[hr]Here's hoping this is another Stormblood situation, where the post-launch content rocks, cause so far the start of this expansion hasn't really impressed beyond how it looks. But just because it looks pretty, doesn't mean there's much beyond past the surface, so yes, Dawntrail right now is as shallow as a shiny puddle.",1719875836,13,0,negative

Untreatable bonds and noble sacrifice, sprinkled with moments of levity to counterbalance the pathos. It’s got it all.""EDIT: Added the below part after having finished MSQ and done some raiding, few weeks after initial review.The inital part of my review still stands. This is a new story, and people need to understand this. Having said that... the story is clearly split into two parts. Without giving too much spoilers, the first part feels great at first. Then it drags on, and the Scions are basically irrelevant. It's super annoying. But then you enter the 2nd part and things start going HARD. While at a micro level you can say X Y or Z are annoying, like the Scions still not being relevant or used for anything other than Trial Trusts. Overall I enjoyed the second part WAY more. You will know when you get there.First part story: 4/102nd part story: 8/10Dungeon desgin: 8/10 (only downside is some really awkward 2-unit packs. Feels like we ARR again...)Trials: 8/10Raid: 8/10Overall combat experience: 8/10, really refreshing combat mechanics add this expansion. You can really see their new philosophy.Classes are OK, nothing really changed too much. Feels like they didn't want to change too much so they could focus on the job changes in 8.0 without having to worry too much changing balance in Dawntrail. 6/10, just more Endwalker, but better QoL.Music: 9/10, except for that stupid High School Music song with the vocals. That specific song is an actual 1/10, muted the game every time that came on. Extremely cringe._____________________________As you can see, most of it is good. I timed it and the entire MSQ took me 47 hours and 5 minutes. However, I spent a good 30 hours not liking what was happening, actually feeling like I was back in Stormblood questioning wtf the writers were thinking. Feels like World of Warcraft writing.Because of those horrible 30 hours, I'm giving it a thumbs down to send a message to the writers. Again, EVERTYHING ELSE is GOOD, if not the best version of it we have ever had (combat). But I shouldn't be required to sit through 30 hours of WoW writing for it. If I wanted that, I would just play another MMO. Story is FFXIV's major strength, and when that falls flat, it weighs more than all the other aspects this expansion.",1719872967,0,0,negative

Kazuya from TEKKEN being into shoe collecting has more personality than her entire character. You will hear her same anime monologue over and over again, and at times her VA is bad that it completely takes me out.

The best story threads are given the least amount of screen-time and [b]EVERY[/b] little ""twist"" in the story is very obviously foreshadowed, followed by a character pointing it out, and then it gets revealed. Onto another fetch quest, I guess.

I have to deal with these topics on a nearly daily basis, and having it forced in my face with obvious resemblances to groups in reality is too jarring and an obvious ploy to push an agenda.That tangent out of the way. the entirety of the story is an unmemorable escort mission. You spend all the time up to level 98 visiting the many different tribes doing tests that all boil down to one thing, learn about that tribes history and culture and prove Wuk Lamat's intentions to rule while continuing to respect their ways of life. Once the ruler of Tural is decided the story does start to pick up, mostly cause of how different it is compared to the previous 30 or so hours of content. Sadly the lectures of friendship and understanding doesn't quite end even as your fighting a world ending threat, so while I did enjoy the last few hours it doesn't make up for the rest of the expansions story.Not much to say about the gameplay, as I'm sure anyone reading this review is well aware of how ff14 plays at this point. I do however want to say that despite what the developers said they wanted to make the content more challenging, I haven't noticed any improvements in that regard. Though that might be thanks to the 9,606.4 hours I spent into the game, this might change once alliance raids and savage comes out.For these reasons I can't recommend this expansion to people that like and care about story in their games. For people that don't care these reasons won't apply, as they'll be skipping all the text anyways. I hope and pray the future of FF14 changes for the better, but only time will tell.",1719865567,11,0,negative
76561198127290063,231178,133,english,"I finished the Story of Dawntrail and wanted to share my opinion on it. In short, its... Meh.The start of the Story is REALLY REALLY SLOW and tedious, i was never bored more in my life than here. After the Initial entry and on the way to the mid part the Story starts picking up the pace and becomes much more interesting. Personally, i have no problem with Wuk Lamat and everyone who say like: ""Our character and the others didn't do much here"" Yes, because its at that point not really our story, we are the sidekicks or ""the Friend of the Hero"" at this moment. I really like how the Siblings worked together to beat that Sky Snake and it appeared everyone of them actually has Proper Motives. Koana i like a lot, Wuk Lamat comes over as compassionate and Zoraal Ja is a Dick but it appears there is more behind that Cold shell of his... Haha... we will come back to this piece of Dumpster Fire character later. I liked a lot how we got to know why this one tribe so much Believed in Two-Headed Ja´s to be superior and fixed that as well. The Doungens so far were quite nice and okay. At the End of, let's call it Part 1, was VERY Satisfying. Wuk Lamat has grown a lot, same has Koana and I really loved how Wuk Lamat wanted Koana to be with her Dawnserpant, Head of Season and Resolf like before, two Head to Rule the Country, each of them complimenting each other. Haha... Now we come to the Dumpsterfire that is Part 2... And Holy shit... they fumbled the Ball so badly i kind of dont want more of that story...It starts very Tame, we go to visit the other part of the Country we wanted to visit at the very beginning, do some Cowboy stuff, its quiet nice. Then the DOME appears and thats where the action starts. The City gets attacked by Robots and People fucking Die! We see a Random Girl, completely out of place in a fancy dress looking very concerned, but we dont mind at all and Head to the Palace where Zoraal Ja gets booty wopped by his Vather because he is a traitor and kills his own people coz he is the King now of a Cyberpunk Race... That has so many problems it's ridiculous... Gulool Ja Ja didn't need to die here for the story to work, he only died, so they could take the easiest path and send Wuk Lamat on a Path of Revenge THAT MAKES NO SENSE to her character, it incredibly forced and the entire rest fo the story, would function without the extremely forced Death of Gulool Ja Ja. Zooral Ja gets his boot kicked by his father and fucking DIES! Uopsm no he gets revived, a power up! and kills his father all while we watch like Suprised Pikachu face... This is where OUR part as the MC gets ridiculous and pathetic. Zoraal Ja should have never won here, Gulool Ja Ja should have beaten his Ass even in the Power up state, to fuel His ""Rage"" let's say, more and let him retreat. But let's go on, we find out the dome is the Headquarters of the enemies, and we go there Epicly with a Boom Rain to Boom open their gates. We get... a good Doungen, the bosses are good, except the last one, but the middle bos was actually fun (this is with most bossed in this DLC in the dungeons so, fun, somewhat challenging GREAT!) We learn that another shard and this have kinda fused together in a way, where learn of Sphene and all the other shit thats going on here. sphene is the Queen and Kinda now, because Zoraal Ja is the current King so she is literally ""useless"" the whole story and can't decide things for herself because she is Powerless. But she is really nice, a gentle soul, made for us to Love and Like her! And yes, she is an interesting character and compelling. What is not compelling is how they handled her. Sphene is a tool, nothing more, to bring somewhat of a motivatio? I guess?Solution 9 is a great city and ARE SPHENES PEOPLE, they solely Focused on the part about the ""Endless"" and Wuk Lamats Revenge against Zoraal Ja, that they fumbled multiple story points so badly. Drama... is good, it makes a story interesting, but if you have: Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama. The story loses its Point... The Last Area and last parts of the story, were only: ""OH let's get to the next Sad part! And the next and the next!"" it became so numb, I mean... what should I expect? I mean, yeah the whole last Area is just a big Sad story. But they could have done it all so much better... The second part of the story... is a Dumpster Fire of half-backed Ideas, missed principles, and stupid storywriting. They can really see, that the second part of the story, is probably where they need to get the game done and shipped finally, it feels so rushed... for the first part I needed like 3 Days to finish. The Second part is a single day, and thats where the most interesting stuff should have been...But enough talking... Someone would now say: ""Ah if the story was so bad, how would you do it, huh?""Yeah, i know how. Done kill Gulool Ja Ja, that would bidder Zoraal Ja even more furious that he still cant beat his father after all he achieved and give a good reason why to fight Tural and wait with his invasion to prepare a proper attack where we come into play to inflate the stuff. The Resistance was a joke in the story, we saw them do NOTHING of importance, just that they exist and welp, thats it. Make is a BIG part that they IS a Resistance and regularly manipulate Zoraal Ja's invasion plans, making the initial reason why Cahciua is ""Hiding"" Make Cahciua a real Resistance Leader and with a more prominent part and... Dont make her be dead and remove that insignificant time skip that actually serves no purpose, but inflicting ""DRAMA"" because ohno... people aged inside the dome... We kill Zoraal Ja like usual because he was so pissed and pathetic, he still got his outburst against Sphene, started to kill her peale in solution 9 and gets so beefed up on soul juice, he became a trial. Bravo. Then get to the Endless stuff, where most can play out as it is so we get to know Alexandria, i would only add that some people WANT this to end and see this Fake world as a nightmare and some find it okay or even love it. But because of Copium. As we know, not all Endless, get Bodys there. this was briefly mentioned, make it a BIG PART, what if you are there with your parent and you never get to see each other, because not all get a body! Cahciua can still be there but not dead and be the Guide because she knows the most shit out of all of us. Sphene deletes herself, but here is the difference, actually not because she could bring herself to really do it but takes on this hard shell. We beat her in the fight, Wuk Lamat tries to reason with her and tells her THAT SHE STILL HAS PEOPLE IN SOLUTION 9 THAT NEED HER AND SHE APPARENTLY FORGOT ABOUT THEM. She realized she failed her Duty to her people and sustaining the endless only would have never worked anyway, because what should she do? Once she sucked up all shards in existence, her race is fucked anyway. She was just prolonging suffering. She realized she needed to be there for the people she still has and protect them, which would also technically not violate her code since she sees them as People of Alexandria as well. Have a Figurehead that now is owning up to her mistakes and stubbornness, building up the story of Tural more and the unusual union Tural is building with actually another shard that kinda fused into their country, which would make so much sense since Tural is all about peace and maintaining it and befinding others...End Result:First Part: 7/10Wuk Lamat: 9/10Our MC Score: Holiday MoreSecond Part 2/10Wuk Lamat: 3/10Our MC Score: Utterly useless BafoonRemember, this is almost only a Review about the story, not the gameplay itself.

Still have to slog through the longest cut-scenes in the entire game to get to the good shit though.An actual waste of time, feels like playing base game ARR again, but I don't get why I'm even there.Watch as you, the Warrior of Light, Savior of the Star, take a vacation to watch countless people get murdered over and over again so that some random Princess can have a little growth. Every time the story gives you some hope of redemption, watch as they effortlessly take away your ability to accomplish anything by ignoring every piece of knowledge your character(and the Scions) have accumulated over the last several expansions. At least we got to step away from Lyse and Ala Mhigo for a huge portion of Stormblood, I literally feel so inconsequential here. I was actually hoping for a vacation, but instead of got a shoehorned in world-ending scenario that makes no sense in the grand scheme of things. I would give this a mixed opinion if I could, because the Dungeons and trials are exceptionally well designed. Genuinely a HUGE step in the right direction. The story is such a slog that I can't possibly choose to recommend it over not recommending it.

Dawntrail's first hours feel more like a visual novel than an RPG, I found myself constantly getting distracted by things outside of the game while sitting through cut-scenes and dialogue. I understand that they're trying to set up a new area and a new story but the writing feels underwhelming and uninspired, and when I can't be bothered to even pay attention to the game's opening moments which are designed to reel the player in, I can't imagine the rest of the game will be all that enticing. However, I don't view my own opinions as being objectively correct.

76561198012875723,0,0,english,"I will continue playing, despite the very weak main story quest experience, largely due to the fact that the content that I am going to be engaged with the most (e.g. trials/dungeons) exhibited a marked increase in quality and difficulty, much to the disdain of the new players I'm sure. And I am hopeful that the raids, future patch MSQ trials and dungeons and so on will be similar. Would I recommend you pick the game up now as a new player simply on the promise of these things in Dawntrail? No. But there is plenty of other content in the game for a new player to enjoy, so I wouldn't shun the game on the whole. But this expansion definitely kinda sucked.The graphics improvements are... okay. They are made less impactful by virtue of many older gear sets not getting texture upscales/not getting multiple color channels for dyes. Nevermind that the color channels for various new gear is rather wanting/questionable decisions were made about what things should or shouldn't be separately colorable.As it pertains to the story, I am very disappointed. SE clearly missed the mark. I think that the plot would have worked better, and people would have been more accepting of it, had they buffered the story of Dawntrail in such a way that we would have had more time to get to know Wuk Lamat that felt less forced. Basically, given us a reason to want to help her, rather than forcing us to hard carry a stranger to the top so they can become a monarch on the promise of a good time.If they had done that, and did a better job writing her character so she didn't seem so flat even after the character growth and development she did experience during this MSQ, I would have fewer complaints even with all of the front loaded lore dumping they did at the start. I have no problem riding shotgun to someone else's story after the books more or less closed on our own. But the game didn't win me over with Wuk Lamat's personality, the only thing she had going for her, and therefore it made me less motivated to slog through the quests. It does get better in the latter part of the story, but the better part feels... very forced. It almost felt like it should have been extended out over the patch quests, but I understand that would have mean't [spoiler]not being able to reveal at least two separate environments until after the end of the 7.0 questline[/spoiler] which with how the story is written at present seems unreasonable.",1719853128,9,0,negative

And I'm talking about introduced but unexplained things here, you know, the things that make people talk and theorise? Can't have any of that anymore, that's too smart for modern FFXIV players I guess? It wasn't enough for the general content to be braindead anymore, we needed the story to be easily digested trash as well.There are so many more things I could say but I'll make it short now, I'm afraid FFXIV has become a soulless product and nothing more, a damn shame when it used to be the paragon of Theme Park MMOs.

I finished MSQ this morning, and it's left me sitting with a lot of complicated feelings. This expansion has some of the absolute best gameplay content, duty design and set dressing, but it's absolutely hamstrung by a lifeless MSQ riddled with pacing issues and bland one dimensional characters. The spark feels like it's gone from the writing team, like they don't know what direction to go in, or worse - are afraid to take a risk.This whole expansion could have succeeded even if the WoL wasn't there. At every moment I was shackled to Wuk Lamat, sometimes having several entries in my journal with a variation of 'Speak to Wuk Lamat again'. There was no character development for any of the scions, there was no chance for growth or any room to talk about recovering from what happened in Endwalker. Character moments (unless they involved Wuk Lamat) were few and far between, and often felt very shoehorned in. This is not an expansion where the WoL has an active role, even a secondary role - DT defenders love to talk about how 'the WoL has always been secondary!' yeah, they have, to Aymeric, to Estinien, to G'raha, to whoever, but at least we were secondary! This time, the narrative just has the WoL watch!Encounter design is fantastic, dungeons feel rewarding, and I'm excited for Arcadion Savage.

76561198047638458,121000,1,english,"First of all, this recommendation is solely based on the MSQ's story. The trials, dungeons, and new areas are quite fun, so if you never cared for the story, you will probably still have a great time with the expansion. Unlike a lot of people, I do not mind the slower pace or lower stakes. There are, however, three points that made me dislike this story in general.First, you are no longer the main character this expansion. By that I mean, that unlike in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, it doesn't feel like you're the big hero those games set you up to be, with the story instead super focused on Wuk Lamat. Moments where you would have expected your character to step forward and save the day like in the previous two expansions are instead almost totally absent or diminished by the participation of other characters. This is a big shame, because FFXIV always stood out to me compared to other MMOs due to the fact you felt like the main character in the story rather than just a passenger. This expansion takes a huge step back in that regard, and it feels as if the whole story could have happened without your character there.Second, some cliche themes and characterization around Wuk Lamat, the main character of this expansion. Mind you, I know FFXIV always had some rather cliche themes like the power of hope and friendship, but in the previous two expansions it felt like it was addressed really well and balanced with some darker and more realistic themes. Here, though, Wuk Lamat feels like a ray of sunshine that constantly repeats the same thing about peace, and the perceived flaws she does have are overcome in ways that don't feel earned at all. She never feels challenged in her ideals, and although I don't mind the character, she is someone who I imagine most people will find grating, which won't help in others' enjoyement since she is there all the time in all the big moments.Third, retreading themes. This one is a spoiler, so I won't get too much into it, but this expansion addressed a lot of the same themes that we did in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, which feels completely unnecessary after we closed that arc. Not only that, but it also fails to be anywhere as nuanced or as good as its predecessors, and the villains simply do not measure up to what we had before.Overall, it's a big disappointment for me and a bad way to start a new arc. I hope the writers can realize what made the last two expansions so good and focus on that again moving forward.",1719840247,16,0,negative

Every time I play this for a few hours I find myself drowsy, it's been great to help me get more sleep.It's like the developers are aggressively against introducing anything fun into the game, and they are very good at that. Even the glimpses of something good are maimed by odd design choices that sabotage it.The combat in this game manages to become even worse with each passing patch, it's over-streamlined to the point that it could just be automated. Boss fights are just a game of ""Simon Says"" that always follows the exact same script and never ever change from that.The class design is a big part of why the combat is so dull and boring. There's no creativity, no uniqueness, the developers are deathly afraid of creating any sort of imbalance so they go to the opposite extreme of making everyone exactly the same. Everything is too sterile, too safe.And that formulaic mentality was over-applied to quests in Endwalker and Post-Endwalker, and seems that they get even worse in Dawntrail. It's like we're back in 2.0 ARR days with how much padding and filler we have in-between any interesting development in the history.The story used to be the main saving grace for FFXIV, but Dawntrail reads like amateur fanfic that keeps trying to re-use the successful story beats from Shadowbringers but is extremely ham-fisted and bad at it. It also keeps repeating the same style of cutscenes and dialogue over and over and over and over.Silly of me to have expected anything different from this game after Endwalker, so don't do the same mistake that I did.

76561198041863837,0,0,english,"I don't write reviews very often but I feel like this one warrants one. I've been playing FFXIV since Heavensward and, for better or worse, it's always been one of my favourite games.Before I start, I want it to be known that I have completed the entire expansion and I have over 3000 hours in this game.Let's start off with the positives, because there's a lot that Dawntrail does well.The zones are gorgeous and full of great details, the music is fantastic as always and the voice acting is... passable, for the most part. The mamool ja characters in particular are especially well voice acted. The content itself - the dungeons and trials (raids haven't been released as of the time of writing) are some of the best we've seen in a very long time. I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the dungeons and every trial was spectacular.The problems arise with the story. At the start it seems like it might just be a slow burn where you're being eased into the characters and the continent, but you'll very quickly realise that 90% of the story is filler where absolutely nothing remotely interesting or impactful happens for SEVERAL HOURS at a time. The writing is horrendously bad, with awful pacing, nonsensical character motivations and an overall story which just feels pointless and tedious. Every other NPC interaction throws you into a 5-10 minute long cutscene which adds nothing to the story and only serves to cripple the pacing while the characters just reiterate what you can already see directly in front of you or you could easily intuit by yourself.Let's address the main problem people have with this expansion: Wuk Lamat. In my opinion she's not an offensively [i] bad [/i] character per se - certainly not as bad as Zero, but the fact that the entire story revolves around her character development makes the player character's role feel insignificant. What is the point of us even being here if Wuk Lamat has to do everything on her own and she's the centre of every cutscene?Abysmal story aside, there's one other major issue I have with Dawntrail, and that's the class design. Class design has been a growing concern in FFXIV for several years now, with more and more classes becoming homogenised and simplified versions of what used to make them fun. The issue isn't that the jobs have gotten worse, it's that [i] nothing has changed about them at all. [/i] I'm a tank player primarily, and we haven't had a meaningful update since Shadowbringers, leading to the role feeling incredibly stale and repetitive. I can't speak so much for other roles or jobs, but tanking in particular has sorely needed some updates for several years and has only been seemingly ignored in favour of pushing new flashy DPS jobs.Overall I'm thoroughly disappointed by Dawntrail. After the awful 6.x series I was really hoping for a fresh, exciting new expansion but what we ended up getting was a watered down, half-baked story with shallow characters, poor writing and some of the slowest, dullest pacing I've ever seen in a game.",1719830633,201,6,negative

She's so naive its nauseating, I don't know if the robots at square enix have ever attempted to try and learn how real people act, but it certainly doesn't show with her.

You want me to help her, but I legit can't think of a single character i would want to help any less than her.-the story is uninspired and the ""twist"" at the end when you think you won but ""omg there was an even worse villain all along ahhhhhh"" was the most lazy, cop out, pad your playtime ending I've ever played in a game.

Going forward with literally zero expectations on what the story would bring me, I was shocked to find my heart sinking with each passing day as I slogged through what I can only describe as the most tedious and absolutely uneventful ""Visual Novel"" I have ever witnessed.I've been playing this game since A Realm Reborn and that was tough to get through at times but there was good writing to carry me through.  Dawntrail has failed from the start because of it's weak writing - I predicted what was to come from after an hour of playing.  I tell you now it was no joy when my predictions were proven true the second day of Early Access.The farther I progressed through MSQ (Main Story Quest) the angrier I became.  The writing came off as ""telling me"" how I should feel instead of ""showing me"" - it didn't evoke any emotion even in the moments of high tension and tragedy.  It forced these dramatic moments on me after just introducing new characters to which I had no investment in.  The subplots were full of holes, much of the story was nonsensical and they were trying so hard for comedic moments where once again they're ""Telling"" me this scene is funny instead of making me laugh by ""showing"" me it was.

No spoilers.Dawntrail's story is genuinely atrocious. I went into it not expecting much as it is a soft reset of the story after ShB/EW, but man did they fuck it up. It's incredibly slow, monotonous, and repetitive. I hope you enjoy going over the ""I will become Dawn Servant through friendship!"" plot point and talking to villagers for information because that is all you're going to do for around 15-20 hours until something noteworthy happens. There is build up to cool moments which are immediately squashed by around 1 hr of cutscenes and more talk to villager quests. Intelligent characters just all conveniently become stupid for the sake of continuing the plot multiple times, including your own character which is frustrating. Speaking of your character - you're basically a NPC character which, in a game like FFXIV where people create very strong bonds with their characters, is annoying and certainly a choice. The dungeons, music, and graphics update is good though. But since FFXIV gets lauded for it's story a lot, this is what they are getting graded on.

They need to just completely look at this expac with new eyes and redo a fair bit of it.Update: I finished the story, everything got a bit better until the final trial. Whoever decided on that forced as fuck ending needs to never touch a story again. Then I tried the expert dungeons. I didn't realize how bad it could get. The boardwalk dungeon was the worst dungeon I've had the displeasure of experiencing. The first boss has fast moving entities that will bind and then promptly silence for 10 seconds you while the boss will spam aoes that will kill you in 2 hits without healing. Then the second boss has teacups that go at 50 MPH and two contain aoes that hit hard as well. While not as egregious as the first boss, that's still really bad. Then the tenderfields (the second expert dungeon) started off horribly, the first boss has the DT problem of ""telegraphs you won't understand until you get hit by it at least once"". When people asked for harder dungeons, this isn't what they wanted. This doesn't even exist in harder content like extremes, savages and ultimates. The fact that this was approved to be sent out to the public is such a baffling decision, combined with questionable job changes designed to sandblast off the identity of the jobs makes we worry about the future of the game.

Dawntrail should have been something where we got to know Wuk Lamat and the other promises. Instead, we're thrust headlong into this, having known her for all of a week. A massive political vying for a throne of a place we literally just came to. Instead of ever getting to know the other promises above their surface level, and extremely one dimensional I might add, desires, we're pit against them all. Wuk Lamat is given a leash and we just happen to be on the other end of it. Erenville also takes an enormous role in this for seemingly no reason. Far larger a part than one would expect of someone supposed to be guiding us. For example, we go to a Moblin village and begin to talk to one of them. We ask about the village, and instead of the Moblin answering, Erenville answers. Why? Could the Moblin not have given us that information from HIS village?So the Warrior of Light goes to this new land to hopefully have a nice, casual adventure. Right up until the point of a literal ""AND THEN, THIS!"" happening. Which sends us right into an extremely thinly connected Sci-Fi spin to the entire story. Quite literally, we go from Cowboys to Aliens in the matter of a couple moments.

The whole premise is nonsensical; you're told explicitly you're going on a giant, multi-part fetch quest as part of a contest. Moreover, it's understandable to have a story where the WoL takes a backseat to another character... it's not when the other character is a Mary Sue and her antagonists are just as bland as her. And for a supposed ""reboot"", why are almost all the Scions STILL here?It's all nonsensical from the very start.

""Lets see why u are doing that"". ""Oh its your culture"". ""Well nothing we can do about that plz stop tho u don't need to do it"" Wuk proceeds to talk to 3 people and now we are friends with them and they suddendly stop doing it and everything they have done is forgiven in an instant LOL.Like who wrote that a 5 year old??? A 5 year old that can't write a conclusion to a conflict or any consequences for the antagonist.Spoiler:Wuk Lamats character was fine at the beginning because u dealt with people that are already on your side to begin with and the writing worked fine with that. (If u like that) As soon as you go close to the 2nd arc everything went to shit. The story was better over all but the writing got so much worse cuz they couldn't write any consequences for the evil characters, everyone was forgiven after 1 s of talking and no one cared when they fucked us over 10 times before that. It was literally insufferable to watch Wuk lamat to talk about family and understanding culture while they try to end the lives of every citizen. And lets not start about the pacing. Antagonist tells us u have to come fight him as fast as possible and if we not appear he gonna attack the innocent people in your city. Wuk Lamat proceeds to learn the culture of people in multiple zones while doing absolute nothing to find the antagonist because someone said we don't know where he is lol, like that ever stopped us. And guess what he attacked because we were to slow, but of course everything was fine because we have the dragons on our side??? We never heard or seen them talking to Vtra but he is here and saves the day not talking 1 word and after defending is gone 1 min later.In conclusion get new writers they made a decent story to an insufferable mess.Positives:Graphics and Battle Content was the best in all of ffxiv.

76561198043387533,0,0,english,"I honestly wish there was a middling grade I could give here instead of good or bad, but considering the story, I have to lean towards bad, I don't want the next expansion to repeat this type of storyline, thus I feel giving negative feedback is the most appropriate.First what is good about this expansion, most of the dungeons and fights are pretty great, I had fun with nearly all of them I've done so far and I doubt they're going to be worse as I continue, the music is also pretty good there some great bangers. Most of the story that doesn't involve Wuk Lamat is pretty decent, and her character does improve a little near the end.Now for what is middling, the zones are take it or leave it, it also feels like you're done with an area way too quick and you barely have done anything in those place, also a lot of the area's are really samey until the later half.The reason why I have to not recommend this game, the story in the first half is abysmal, this will contain some minor spoilers so don't read if you care. First, the biggest thorn in the room is Wuk Lamat, the story hinges on her being a good character and if you enjoy her the first half will be better, in fact the entire story, since she is the only character that really maters with some other new side characters, the old characters pretty much get sidelined. There is a high chance you're going to dislike her, because her only good trait is being nice and she is very quirky, it doesn't help that every other character treats her with endearment or the fact that she becomes instant best friends with the main character if you hate her, it really hurts to go through this.However even if you like Wuk Lamat, I believe the first part of this story is going to grate on you, most of it is like being guided around a museum about things you don't care about, they go way too indepth about lore that you yet have to care about because you're new to the place and have no investment in it, it's slow, tedious and boring. It's hard to care about cultures and history you have 0 investiment in and this is basically most of the first half of the story, told to you through droves and droves of text. The writer for the first half of the game should get fired.In the end the story does pick up a little and becomes so-so, but it's entirely likely you won't care for it anymore because of the bad foundation and low investiment, you won't care about most things that are happening because it doesn't really affect your character or even much at all, still if you're in it like me for the combat and dungeons, it'd still recommend it, but if you are in it for the story, probably wait until they put it on a sale.Finally, I don't think the future isn't as bleak as people say, they still have good writers it shows from time to time, they really just need to fire the main writer or give him/her a smaller role. The next writer literally can just ignore everything from dawntrail and make an actual good story next time, nobody or barely anyone will miss it.",1719793958,17,0,negative

But that's about it. For a story driven MMO and after the success and experiance which I had in ShB and EW I'm absolutely disappointed in the mess that we've got presented in this MSQ. It's such a lackluster and unfun that it made me outright bored and even angry at times. Sure we've been told that it's going to be a new beginning and a slow story, but even then it missed every single shot.For one the main problem of the DT MSQ: Wuk Lamat.Not even does she feel (or basically is) like a horribly written character, the VAs also failed to do their job propperly besides in the JP version. So much even that I either turned the volume down or skipped the voiced parts as fast as I could. Adding the bland and sometimes annoying voice acting with the way she's written as a character was a pure setup for failure from  the beginning. Also the way the MSQ revolves purely around her and her quirky and clumsy behaviour only for her to then have multiple characteristic aweakenings only for acting clumsy in the next scene once again.Overall it feels like this MSQ and main character was written as a fanfiction for teens where the power of friendship makes one a hero over night and saves the day again and again. And it so.. SO bothers me that she ruined even the absolute last part of the story with her sudden appearance and ""friendship and love is magic :3"" attitude. But who knows, maybe it's then again the VAs fault for not delivering.In addition that the way the story progresses makes little sense and has -so- many loose ends and feels simply rushed on so many occasions while being stretched with unneccessary fetch, follow and hide quest that even ARR looked like an action game. And even though worldbuilding for the open world was never one of XIVs strengths it feels like they've put as little work in it as they possibly could, leaving many places completly empty or putting towns which should be far apart from each other not even ten seconds in walking distances away.Then there is a content and item void outside of the MSQ, with reskins from older expansion being the this ones gear and nothing else really to do besides leveling up other jobs. Barely any new items, hairstyles, emotes, etc.The only positive thing so far was the graphics update for me. Things do look better here and there and the new grass and foliage system really makes a few spots look great though. But other than that I can't really find anything else positive to say. That's it. Sadly not even the music could carry this one since everything sounds way to simmilar or doesn't at all, like electric jazz for a tribal city like Tulliolal? Huh?((also did the MSQ and first lvl. 100 with AST and they've butchered that one with the cards update, it hurts))Overall a 1 out of 10 Expac and it saddens me.I really hope Wuk Lamat doesn't show up in the 7.x patches with us and that the writing get's back on it's ShB / EW level.Looking forward to the planet exploration and field mission content.",1719788145,15,0,negative

The stretches between combat segments and instanced content are larger than ever and almost none of the story moments that happen between are entertaining or interesting. There's no intrigue in the plot, very few likeable new characters, and almost nothing of note from any of the returning cast. Everyone that isn't named Wuk Lamat barely says or does anything to contribute or move things forward or provide any alternative insight, and Wuk Lamat herself is overbearing and childish with 2 or 3 unfunny ""quirky"" character gags that she constantly repeats over and over. The other party members like Alphinaud, Alisaie, Krile, and even your PC don't matter at all. They may as well not even be there, they barely even contribute to conversations and usually 2 or 3 of them are being sent off somewhere else so they don't get in the way while Wuk Lamat talks to whatever story NPC is relevant to the current zone.I've never considered skipping MSQ cutscenes more than I have after the 10th hour of this tedious slog.

76561198053532926,0,0,english,"I have never been so disappointed in an expansion, especially one with the opportunity to start fresh with a brand new story. Coming off Endwalker, I don't believe anyone was expecting another world ending event etc, but the story presented is exceptionally poor. We've been exposed to numerous ways they could have started a new story from scratch; a new shard, an alternate reality, separating WOL from the prior cast via some sort of abduction to introduce a new one and drip feed the old cast per expansion etc, digital landscapes like OMEGA. However, we are presented to a...Mayan / Western / Cyberpunk setting for reasons...? The first city hub is clearly where the developers really front loaded everything, it is the best location in the expansion. The music being jazz for a Mayan-esque area is odd...but it's good jazz so it's fine. Every other region is devoid of life, barren and spacious with little to no reason to ever return. The end city hub is monstrous in size, but absolutely empty. Honestly, it looks awful, the color scheme, smooth texture-less surfaces, the spread out vendors, it looks like a ghost city as there are next to no NPCs walking around or existing. The empty space is jarring from a design perspective, I find it hard that someone looked it over and approved it, but a lot of other city hubs in prior expansions suffer the same. Realistically, you'll resume AFK-ing in Limsa so what does it matter?The entire expansion is literally walking three feet, clicking spots, waiting, turn in quest. Which is par for the course with every expansion, but it is exceptionally worse in this one, think ARR all over again. It takes hours to get into the first dungeon, and subsequent hours between the other dungeons. The WOL that effectively has killed numerous gods and saved the world countless times is now effectively back to Level-5 doing fetch quests. The out of dungeon / trial combat is incredibly sparse, much more than prior expansions. This could be summed up as a walking simulator, mixed with a VN. The story is incredibly dry, filled with padded conversations that have no bearing on the overall narrative, which also is very uninspired and boring. It picks up slightly around level 96-97, but by that point your brain has shut off and you're more likely than not just skipping the dialogue due to how poor it is and how unlikable the new escort companion, Wuk Lamat is. You can tell that either all the development time, I believe two years, was spent on the graphics update, (which effectively turned the Early Playstation 3 style graphics to Late Playstation 3 style graphics, not bad or unwanted, but still...), or this was a throw away story written prior or alongside Heavensward and scrapped for one reason or another. There are tons of issues with the story, but to list them all would spoil things.The dungeons and trials, on the other hand, are pretty fun and challenging. I don't have too many complaints in that regard, and at the end of the day, that's all that matters as you'll be spamming them for dailies at the end.Mechanically, there is nothing really new, no overhaul or different way to play / interact with the game, just more of the same which isn't ""bad"", but after so long some innovation might be nice. Endwalker brought in new players who had never played the game at all, this expansion seems to be pushing out the existing players the further they get into the expansion.

Ever since the StormBlood class reworks every expansion has homogenized, simplified and streamlined classes more and more. Tanks and healers have it the worst.

The bi-annual astro and monk reworks also make another return to no avail. Square still has no clue what to do with these jobs and Monk has been dumbed down even more to a simple 1-2-3 class.Every expansion the only new thing added is another high potency 30/60sec cooldown to press. It's unbelievably boring. If next expansion they dont step away from this formula this game is doomed. I've been playing the exact same jobs with nearly no gameplay or rotational changes for 4 years now, and it's going to be another 2 years of the exact same thing from the looks of it. The main story is also a joke, it's poorly paced, the first 70% of the story is an extremely boring tournament arc/ coming of age story of Wuk Lamat's coming of age story but is incredibly uninteresting. I don't want to post any spoilers but what happens with the ""gate"" and the Zoraal Ja makes absolutely 0 sense. The graphical and engine update is absolutely amazing though.

Trying to traverse the new maps is like trying to find your way through the Himalayan fucking mountains, and places where you think you can jump off of (and be at your target location way faster), you face invisible walls, well fuck you then square! Some maps have bad aetheryte placements as well, forcing you to walk from one side of the map to the other and sometimes all the way back again BECAUSE THERE IS NO AETHERYTE NEAR THE QUEST!!Jobs (especially healers) have been so homogenized in Dawntrail that there is literally no difference between them anymore. Healer level ups literally have not had any impact on your gameplay on healer since Shadowbringers. Every level up is just 'Skill X gains one more charge', 'Skill Y gains 20 potency', 'Duration of Skill Z's effect is increased by 5 seconds'. Classes like Astrologian and Monk have been reworked so many times that they've completely lost the identity they once had, and square STILL DOESNT KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO WITH THEM. In Stormblood, Astrologian had different effects for each of their cards. They could augment the effects of their cards, due to their RNG mechanics every pull felt different, there was risk vs reward. Monk had the identity of having different rotations it could follow; it wasn't bound to a single flow, it could adapt to fights easily. Now it's just a reskin of every other 1-2-3 combo class in the game. It's lost it's identity. The gameplay pressure that the game once exerted at a good level (Shadowbringers/maybe Endwalker) has been watered down so much that you can just alt tab every GCD and be completely fine, missing 0 damage on the boss. Just delete half the classes at this point because obviously you can't introduce any form of innovation anymore. After being a diehard Astrologian main for 6 fucking years, I can't take it anymore.

76561198029032133,0,0,english,"New characters are written worse than the average isekai anime, and by the extension the predictable story (the bad kind of predictable) is probably one of if not the worst story I've ever experienced in a game as it revolves around babysitting the dislikeable incompetent whiny side character of said average isekai anime as e.g. the siamese high school bully(ies?) with a slightly sad backstory steps on her tacos or she gets motions sickness for the 15th time.The story sometimes sets up interesting plot points only to fumble the pacing entirely as you're forced to learn about the agriculture of some random town for the next hour instead. The cutscenes are as unsubtle as they can be, constantly taking extra time to e.g. zoom in on clenching fists or other obvious but not screen covering plot points.The transition cutscene for the lv100 trial was so bad it instantly ruined the enjoyment of what is otherwise probably the best normal difficulty fight in the entire game ever. It made me remember how horrible the story of Dawntrail was, something I was actually in the process of forgetting due to how fun the fight was, and solidified this as the first horrible expansion for this game. Boss fights were otherwise decent, all trials were good, dungeons are horrible overall due to what feels like even more forced single pulls against hp sponges without mechanics than usual.Classes continue to be universally pushed towards the same level of boring instead of adding some variety in difficulty between the classes for people who enjoy different things: Just let some classes be super simple and let some have some funky optimizations to do for those that want to. Let some classes have low APM and some classes have high APM. If this causes ""unfixable"" balance issues: stop backloading fights and throw in a soft enrage at the end or something.Someone thought it was a good idea to remove the damage from the two higher APM tanks' gap closers without letting the role who is supposed to protect others at least target their allies with them to compensate. Also since they don't generate enmity now things feel weird as you jump to an enemy and it runs off to punch someone else unless you manually hit it with a different ability too.Overall the other system updates all fall short too:New dye channel doesn't let you choose if your black and blue dress should be white and gold but rather if it should be white and then have a tiny gold button you can't see. This seems to apply to like half the gear with the second channel. Two new classes ([strike] of which the one I've tried at least seems kinda fun, if super simple. [/strike] EDIT: They have now announced they're dumbing it down.) but no new glamour plates so you can't have a unique glamour per combat class anymore.""Movement from wind will appear more consistent at high frame rates."" but Movement Physics are still tied to framerate so hair/ears/clothes etc are still super stiff or even immobile as you go above 60fps.New AO option is excessive and has weird haloing around some objectsThings are weirdly blurry at times, even when turning off raidal blur. Probably due to the new AA setting (that at least fixes flickering in foliage and stuff) but it seems excessive. Personally think it looks better if turning the 3d render resolution with FSR to 99% so its sharpening filter turns on.DLSS doesn't seem to have any quality/performance/auto etc options so it'll turn the game from 1440p to 144p if it feels like it.Graphics update is hit and miss: some hairs' color is weirdly different from the color of Viera ears making those hairstyles look very strange. Some faces still give of quite different vibes from before the update even after the second benchmark's fixes. The last boss in one of the lv100 dungeons' cloth looks so good it barely fits into the rest of the game.",1719738225,19,0,negative

It was an easy bar to reach, and square barely managed that with how the NPCs are constantly reminding eachother and myself about how strong I am. And so far all I've done is walk around, and watch other people do things! Even the bad guys aren't really bad guys, they're just friends we haven't made yet. It's so lame. Any hint of combat is quickly squashed with yet another cut scene and maybe a quest where you go pick grass or some nonsense. Or sometimes not and instead everyone just shrugs and goes about their business. Wuk Lamat is also a very lame character. I went in very excited for a multidimensional character with strengths and flaws and secrets. But instead we just get a cat-shaped nuisance with the emotional intelligence and charisma of a wet bag. And we just have to follow this person around while they go do things, or wait around for them to come back from doing things without us.

It did not get better - was almost a complete slog to get through. There's one cool cut scene in the middle, and that's about it. If you like Wuk Lamat, you'll probably love this expansion. If you don't like Wuk Lamat, just save yourself some sanity and skip the cut scenes. Seriously.",1719731862,10,0,negative

To say I love this game would be a colossal understatement. I genuinely believe everything up to 7.0 was the best journey I have ever taken as a Gamer. Yet at the two thirds mark of the story, I just... stopped caring. I was tired of a story that was written to conclusion long before the Warrior of Light was introduced to it. I'm tired of Wuk Lamat just Charisma Checking everything that wasn't her opposing Claimants, I'm tired of her being there in Every. Single. Cutscene. I'm just... tired.

To anyone who says ""This is the first patch, surely the story will get better"" I'd like to point you to World of Warcraft and the expansions 'Battle for Azeroth' and the immediately following 'Shadowlands'. Even if Square Enix is a smarter company than Activision Blizzard, and isn't run by an absolute parasite, we should still make it very clear that the way the story is heading is not good for the game and that they should remove whoever was responsible for both the English Voice Direction as well as the Overall Story from their positions before things get any worse. You can absolutely leave a Positive Review for FFXIV itself, and even flip your Dawntrail thumb later when the patches help fill the holes in the story, but we should make it abundantly clear that 8.0 is not written to an acceptable quality for what we as fans expect.",1719717537,19,2,negative

Unfortunately, I’ve had consistent trouble staying connected to the servers, frequently encountering 2002 errors that result in being kicked out. When I attempt to reconnect, I am placed at the end of an extensive queue with over a thousand players, which is incredibly frustrating.Even when I manage to get back into the game, the experience is marred by significant lag. The gameplay itself does little to make up for these technical issues; the story progresses at a snail's pace, and the characters fail to engage me, often coming across as more annoying than endearing. Overall, the combination of connectivity problems and lackluster content makes for a disappointing gaming experience.So far 6 hours playing the new expansion and 3 hours waiting in line to play the gameEdit:Network difficulties aside and after slogging through 60% of this Expac i must say Wuk lamat has grown on me kind of like a cancer. I am not sure what 90% of the story is as i was forced to skip through as the VA and cheesy dialogue left a cringe on my soul that i could not bear. Dungeons, battle and scenery were great however all of this was overshadowed by the cringe that is Wuk lamatEdit: completed 99% of DT and i must say the story does pickup in the second half, the scenery , battles, dungeons and most of the story is outstanding. This would easily be a 10/10 for me if not for wuk lamat. Her voice and character almost makes me not want to play. the way the entire story revolves around baby sitting this annoying character with no depth and superficial beliefs grates me to no end.

Post MSQ is pretty good - and is carrying this expansion. Look, I know that Dawntrail wasn't going to be Shadowbringer, or Endwalker. But I expected something better than this. Wuk Lamat is probably the most annoying, tedious, and op character I've ever seen. Lymle from Star Ocean is a less annoying character. The story is uninspired, and at some points it doesn't seem like they know what they want to do with it? If you still wanna play all the other Dawntrail content, skip the cutscenes and just read a summary. You'll suffer less. Also, the fucking walking. It seems like they knew they didn't have enough content, and decided to remove some aetherytes to drag it out longer. At least Garlemald was flat and you could autorun the map, the new area have a lot of vertical points, so be prepared to not use autorun. The most painful filler I've seen. You could probably make some Gil flying someone around tbh.Some of the class changes are heartbreaking. I've been an AST main since stormblood, and this expac I dropped it after attempting to play in one dungeon. The changes are absolutely awful. I know this isn't just an SE thing, as lots of game companies have been doing this, but dumbing down classes is absolutely stupid: why are these companies catering to the most lazy of players? The ones who don't want to try to put even a token amount of effort in? These players aren't the ones sticking around and playing the content. The AST changes nearly made me quit the game - I was so heartbroken by the absolute gutting of the card system. The post MSQ dungeons, extremes, and new raid tier are pretty great though. They have a bit of challenge, so we all know that means its going to get nerfed after the lazy ones complain its too much effort to learn - so get in there while you can.

This might be competing with Stormblood for the worst FFXIV expansion so far.I've been playing since 1.0 beta and the only other time I've felt this ammount of tedium coming from the main scenario quests is when 2.0, A Realm Reborn was still a thing. Even now its a sludge to progress through it and regrettably, it feels like this expansion is following its misguided vision.To elaborate a bit: The new zones are amazing and I love them, specially since I'm mexican myself, but the questing and pacing of the msq (main scenario) is a pain in the ass. Not only is there very little combat at first but there is a shit ton of dialogue and cutscenes that feel like chaff. Nothing interesting is really showcased except some of the rather plain personalities of the princes and how immature Wuk Lamat is... If you ever felt that G'raha Tia and Krile have gone through some sort of retardation and went from being cool characters (such as being the Crystal Exarch) to dumb toddlers, well... I have a nasty surprise for you... The new character suffers from the same crap treatment and is probably the worst of them all.Its a shame because the new areas clearly have a lot of work to them and there are some little details that are really cool but the msq is such a boring endeavour that, for someone who never skips cutscenes, I'm always wondering if it wasn't jsut better to skip and be done with it... And don't get me started on one of the villains' logic: ""We should wage war to teach our people the horrors of war itself, that way they wont want conflict anymore..."" Truly a genius, this guy, who wrote the character profile.The new jobs are kinda great but nothing to write home about. Maybe Viper is the best of the two of them, in my opinion, but again, just like in Stormblood, the release of 2 DPS jobs brings chaos to the daily roulette system. Unless you have friends who are willing to play the much sought after healers or tanks, you can spend a lot of time waiting for a queue to pop and do your dungeons and roulettes.Also a big fuck you to SE for showcasing ""tacos"" as some sort of TacoBell TexMex bullshit.

76561198079932954,0,0,english,"-- Update 3 --Final update.TL;DR: 5/10, would not play through the MSQ again. Shifting the story focus away from WoL to instead focus on an annoying and pathetic character that follows an incredibly overplayed underdog trope (Wuk Lamat), while also trying to build a new story ark, was a horribly poor decision on SE's part. The dungeons and trials are great, and the graphical and technical changes are nice as well.Having now finished the expansion, I am thoroughly unimpressed. While the story had a few high points sprinkled throughout, they were far too sparse to make up for the otherwise lackluster experience. I commend the development team on the duties, near all of which were quite interesting, challenging, and enjoyable, as well as many of the system and technical changes. The graphics overhaul is proceeding beautifully, and I'm excited to see the later improvements that come with this.I hope that moving forward the story shifts away from Wuk Lamat and on to more interesting things where the WoL plays a more significant role, rather than babysitting an immature and incompetent brat. I also hope that rather than simplifying things to the lowest common denominator like they have been, the team will instead require that actual skill be necessary to be exemplary at each job. If that makes people upset, all I can say is too bad and get good.-- Update 2 --Approaching the end. If the first half of the expansion was 2/10, the second half is maybe 5/10. There have certainly been some more interesting and engaging parts, however the main character is still primarily the boring and bland Wuk Lamat for much of it.The dungeons and trials here have been for the most part great as well. They've really done a good job here!-- Update 1 --Nearing half way through, there have been a few brief parts of the story that were enjoyable, nearly all of which have been when Wuk Lamat was not present. Still plenty of dull moments where I find myself drawn to skip cutscenes and dialogue as I simply cannot be arsed to care about Wuk Lamat or that which revolves around her.The dungeons and trial so far have been fantastic. Far more challenging and enjoyable than previous expansions!-- Original --As much as I love FFXIV, this expansion really is missing the mark.After a few hours of playing, I've been met by a storm of cutscenes, lengthy dialogue, and fetch quests. The primary NPC, 'Wuk Lamat' is boring, uninteresting, and follows an overplayed and bland underdog trope. I find myself wishing I could be participating with one of the far more interesting and unique competitors than her.I understand that as Endwalker brought the closure of nearly a decade of story and world building, that now we must begin a new cycle, so there's going to be a lot of information being thrown at you, but I wish it was more engaging than it has been so far. This feels more like doing chores than a game. ARR felt more enjoyable than this, even the second or third time through...As it stands I am but a fraction of the way through the expansion, and I hope that it gets better further in, I will update this review as I approach its end.",1719709266,12,0,negative

Alors si vous avez pas envie d'être spoil éviter de lire.Bref Dawntrail ne démarre certes pas sur les chapeaux de roues mais ça passe, toutefois l'extension va très vite devenir très très chiante pour la simple et bonne raison que : votre présence est uniquement requise pour déclencher les cinématiques.Je m'explique, vous devez aider Wuk lamat a devenir reine mais c'est comme aider un clown a devenir le nouveau seigneur de la zone, elle a certes des qualités mais personnellement les blagues a répétition avec elle etc m'ont personnellement très vite tapé sur le système.Toujours en parlant de Wuk lamat, Dawntrail c'est SON extension, pas la vôtre. Vous allez passer 90% de l'histoire principale a allez d'un point A à un point B et regarder Wuk lamat arrivée plus ou moins toutes seules a des conclusions et vous participez ou donné votre avis éventuellement une fois de temps en temps. Les antagonistes sont ses antagonistes, les alliés sont ces alliés, et éventuellement vous allez voir l'histoire de deux autres personnages.Et je ne parle même pas de la gueule des épreuves ou du messages qu'elles sont censés faire passer, je parle du fait que votre présence est purement, simplement dispensable. Prenez un stylo et tentez de réécrire le script de l'extension en retirant votre personnage et vous obtenez le même résultat.Sans compter qu'il se passe rien pendant quasiment toutes l'extension, vous vous baladez dans des zones ou presque jamais rien de plus ou moins grave ne se passe et apprenez Ô combien la paix règne ici.Même pendant la seconde partie de l'épopée vous subissez une attaque qui sera juste une longue cinématique et votre personnage ne participe toujours pas malgré l'abondance de cadavre aux alentours, puis ensuite vous partez pour des heures et des heures de cinématique où il ne se passe rien jusqu'à ce qu'un donjon pop ou une instance pop.Sans comptez les passages qui sont répétitif ou étiré en longueur, c'est vraiment nécessaire de voir la nounou de Wul lamat ou la mère de Erenville ou Otis mourir deux fois ? Genre leurs première mort c'est pas assez impactant ? Ou même bakool ja ja vous avez 3-4 occasion de le pulvériser dans l'aventure mais a chaque fois vous le laissez partir car ""c'est pas le moment"" même chose avec Zoraal Ja, ce qui rend votre personnage encore plus passif que jamais.Les antagonistes parlons en car honnêtement cette extension a les antagonistes les plus pauvres, entre les deux mamool ja avec des daddy issues et Sphene qui passe son temps a faire la girouette entre alliés et ennemis, même si elle fait Echo a Wuk lamat c'est juste pas ouf.Beaucoup me diront "" passage de flambeau, pour une fois que c'est que tu sauve pas le monde bla bla bla "" Dans un sens vous avez raison, mais est ce que les devs se sont sérieusement demandé si TOUS les joueurs avait envie de ça ? Justement pour une fois que j'avais enfin l'occasion de repartir a l'aventure je suis obligé d'assister et de babysit l'aventure d'une autre. Si vous avez aimé ne rien faire et joué les mentors, grand bien vous face mais n'allez pas dire que ceux qui avait envie de vivre autre chose n'ont rien compris.Bref, on passe toute la quête principale a se demander ce qu'on fou la et pour une fois je me suis plus amusé à faire les quêtes secondaires.J'ai rien a dire pour le reste mais pour ceux qui espérer un nouveau départ pour une nouvelle aventure ou vous êtes actifs va falloir attendre la 8.0, je déconseille fortement de se taper la quête principal.",1719703207,17,3,negative

76561198034058420,0,0,english,"This review is mostly about the story and it's writing (minimal spoilers), if you are a weirdo who thinks Final Fantasy games never had a good story or that stories and writing in videogames doesn't matter, then this might trigger you.Two weeks it took us to finish the MSQ, watching every single cutscene and reading every single line of dialogue, and oh boii, when my friends told me ""it gets worse"" I was like ""there is no way the second half of the story can get worse"", it absolutely does.First I must say that absolutely no one cares about Wuk Lamat's voice or the VA, if you do, you need professional help.Second, the theme of the expansion being a ""vacation"" is not the problem, not only because the theme itself is not the issue, but because the issue is that this is false and is borderline false advertising, this is NOT the theme of the expansion.Now, I have been playing the game since 2.0 and we have to admit the quality of the writing during ARR, Stormblood and Endwalker was weak, each in different magnitudes, but it was never offensively bad (examples of offensively bad writing are Dragon Age 2 and Final Fantasy XV, for example).However, Dawntrail's writing quality not only has crossed the line, it becomes as offensively bad as it can be (without losing the 16 pegi rating). The first half of the story is bad, but it never gets offensively bad, the story shows things like how to grow supercrops out of absolutely nowhere thanks to the power of good vibes, something that you would think is a big deal, but it is never mentioned again (rip saving the Garleans from starvation). It also gets into the origins of the lizard people's practice of eugenics, the reason? They are incapable of figuring out farming, that's why they sacrifice thousands of kids for their search of the supreme supersoldier. During this time one of my friends finished the expansion and told me ""It only gets worse"" before cancelling the subscription and uninstalling the game. At this time I thought he was being over dramatic, because sure, it was bad, but it wasn't THAT bad... yet.When you get to the second half of the story it does get better for a while, Wuk Lamat matures and is no longer the butt of the joke, and it even presents mildly interesting topics that will catch your attention, not because it is good, but because it is better than what you experienced before.By the time you get to the level 99 MSQ quests the writers decide they want to see the world burn, throwing out of the window the values that FFXIV has been adopting for over a decade, things like hope, never giving up and searching for solutions that try to maximize the wellbeing of as many people as possible. The writers decided to pull a 180º while trying to copy the same message Shadowbringers tried to send us, about how the Ascians need to let go, that their time passed and they need to accept it, that the Source and Reflections have their own right to exist. However, their new version of the Ascians (Endless) and Amauroth (Alexandria) tries to do the same as Shadowbringers and Endwalker did... culminating a decade long story, but in six (6) hours instead.Not only they managed to spit on the fans of FFIX with extremely poor fan service, they did it while forcing you (the WoL!) to commit genocide against the people of another reflection, the writers only had six (6) hours to try to make you feel bad about committing genocide using cheap tactics like very bland emotional manipulation: What if you get to know this people before you murder them? See? They are people just like you!Doesn't really work and I have to admit it was extremely upsetting to see how the writers were forcing me into perpetrating genocide as ""it is the only option!"" in a game that has been pushing values and principles like being hopeful and finding ways to co-exist with others. There is no attempt to co-exist with anyone, there is no attempt to look for alternatives, there is nothing, you are going to commit genocide and you are going to enjoy it.The moment the happy music kicks in as soon as the credits start to roll was insulting, no one, not a single character bothers to mention what happened, no one cares, no one shows any kind of emotion, it just happens, congratulations, you won and nothing happened here! Not to mention how tone deaf the characters are during this last six hours of the story, not only tone deaf but outright offensive, only Erenville showing any kind of human emotion while the rest of the cast treats this as a regular Monday.Ultimately, I REALLY wish the expansion was about a vacation, a REAL vacation, you are lured in with the promise of adventure and relaxation after over a decade of over the top constant apocalypses threatening the Source. Instead what you find is a MSQ about how you are forced into manipulating the elections to the throne of South America by ""cultivating"" a suitable ruler AND committing genocide in the last six (6) hours of the expansion without ANY kind of depth, commentary or emotion. Congratulations, you ""cultivated"" a suitable ruler to the throne of South America and eradicated the entire population of another Reflections, here is your orchestrion roll with the song ""Smile"".I can't express how as a writer this MSQ makes me feel because Steam is rated e for everyone, so I will just say that I HOPE this MSQ was written by Chat GPT because the Cryptobro CEO of Square Enix fired all writers, because if a group of human beings are responsible for the writing of this expansion, I'm out, there is no way someone read the script and said this was okay, not only because of the poor dialogue, the illusion of choice, the false premise of a vacation, but because this is downright the most offensively bad writing I have seen in a videogame, it puts Dragon Age 2, FFXV and Emil Pagliarulo to SHAME.Maybe I have been spoiled by games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Arknights among many other extremely well written videogames that masterfully touch all kind of themes, tragedies and hopes for a brighter future.People who believe Dawntrail to be a good story really need to read more and demand better stories from Square Enix, because better stories are better for everyone playing the game, not only for the people who doesn't care or don't even know what they are playing.Dawntrail is the last nail in the coffin for me, I don't believe Square Enix as a developer is capable of making a good game, let alone art. I was looking forward to Dawntrail, a new beginning, a fresh experience, a future for the MMO I fell in love with during Heavensward and lost all interest for by the end of Stormblood.We got the most offensively, violently bad writing the XIV team has ever delivered. The classes remain the same as they were in Endwalker, we are going for another two years with the exact same classes we have been playing with for the last three years. The music is completely forgettable, it is not good. The dungeons were somewhat interesting and some new mechanics are great, but they are overshadowed by a new design philosophy that forces you to get hit by them first before you can learn them. The new maps are big, some of them are beautiful, and some are a huge wasted opportunity (Alexandria).At the end, this is the most disappointed I have ever been in FFXIV and the only option given to me by the devs and the community is just to not care, because no one cares, the devs don't care about their own game, and the community doesn't care about what they get from the devs. So why continue playing? Why look forward to Savage? Why look forward to anything story related? The devs don't care about the game they are working on, the community doesn't care about the quality of the game they play, you will be shut down the moment you suggest they deserve better.

Heavensward is for me on par with Shadowbringers in terms of writing, wherein the stakes for the former aren't immediately high, the writing however is good enough with just the right amount of political intrigue and cultish religious ideology. Shadowbringers brought us a complete blockbuster of a story following an anti-hero that had more character and appeal than anyone we had met thus far. However, starting in Endwalker. The writing took a serious hit. Long gone were the stakes, everyone just lived because of the power of friendship. The literal world ending scenario was there and gone again in a matter of cutscenes and there was little to no lasting effect on the populace at large. The blue feeling twitter bird big bad was just terribly executed and the writing took a nosedive.There was also the SEVERE lack of content in EW - the last 8 or 9 months saw very little to nothing being added, EW also brought with it the most EGREGIOUS homogenisation of classes we had ever seen and made the gameplay a snoozefest outside of Ultimate encounters. The quality of the raids also took a serious hit in the methodology and overall world-building that went into them.As a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series and an avid player of FFXIV, I couldn't be more disappointed with the newest expansion, Dawntrail. This supposed epic journey into new realms has turned out to be nothing short of a tedious slog through uninspired writing and lackluster characters.Let's start with Wuk Lamat, perhaps the most irritating character ever conceived in the Final Fantasy universe. From the moment this cringe-worthy NPC graced my screen, I was subjected to incessant chatter that served no purpose other than to grate on my nerves. Wuk Lamat seems to exist solely to annoy players with repetitive dialogue and a personality that makes Jar Jar Binks look like a paragon of depth and sophistication.And speaking of depth, or rather the lack thereof, let's talk about the main character's journey in Dawntrail. It's astonishing how little there is to care about. The narrative lacks any compelling twists or emotional resonance. Instead, it unfolds predictably, as if ticking off boxes on a checklist of RPG clichés. The supposed ""emotional moments"" fall flat, leaving me more indifferent than invested.The writing in Dawntrail is where the true disappointment lies. It's as if the writers took a collection of generic fantasy tropes, threw them into a blender, and poured out a lukewarm sludge of clichés. Dialogue feels forced and unnatural, characters lack depth or development, and the overarching plot fails to inspire any sense of wonder or excitement.It's not just me that feels this way either. Across the internet, other players echo similar sentiments. One review aptly describes Dawntrail as ""a soulless addition to an otherwise beloved franchise,"" while another critic laments, ""I've never been so uninterested in the fate of an in-game world.""It is a monumental letdown. From the grating presence of Wuk Lamat to the shallow narrative and uninspired writing, this expansion fails to capture the essence of what makes Final Fantasy great.

Going back to basics, a new world all of this should have given SE to write someting interesting. Intriguing new characters. What did we get? The most boring fetch quests with no meaning. The entire first two zone quests you do have no impact at all.I've already forgotten what I did in the lvl 90-93 quests which took around 12hours. Cutscene cutscene cutscene no gameplay. I've been fine with this in past expansions because the story was well told, had good pacing and character development with intrigue in wanting to know what happens next.Dawntrail had me falling asleep in my chair, It's the first time I've ever wanted to skip cutscenes during the MSQ, and thats saying something. Hours spent trading to get an alpaca saddle in one zone, and helping grow some weeds in another zone. What happened square? Did all the writers go on strike? Compare what happened in other expansions at the start. You have a major villian or goal, you had the intrigue of the crystal, shards. Now we have.. nothing.Not having a single thing pushing my characters motiviations to keep pushing forward to a goal made me feel like not even playing and I loved HW, ShB and EW. ARR and StB were also far better than this even in their low moments you knew what was coming next and that kept you interested.

76561198027859216,454955,1057,english,"Now that I played through MSQ, I'm rewriting my review. FIrst of all, MSQ really was exceptionally weak this time, but for me the problems seem to be opposite from most people. I really don't give a shit about Wuk Lamat being shoved into my face every cutscene and having her regurgitate things that should've left up to to make conclusions about (Even Stormblood got this part right, there was no moralizing and telling me what I should be thinking even on heavier topics such as how the hell Doman Culture managed to create people like Yotsuyu even at times of peace, or having some character TELL ME how I should be feeling about things). For me, Wuk Lamat was more of a symptom of a disease that the writing had, rather than disease itself. If anything, I think if they kept her personality the same, but toned down on the screentime they were giving her, stopped her from taking spotlight from every other new character introduced and even the Scions and have her repeat everything we've done in dialogue, she would be OK in my opinion. My biggest gripe with the story is that I would genuinely enjoy it if whole of it was like the first half. Give me adventures in new continent, let me explore things and experience new cultures, hell, I would've had a blast if I was doing what Estinien was doing - killing things and eating sabotenders. But instead, halfway through, I got thrown into a shitstorm that made absolutely zero sense, and as much as I enjoyed the zones and aesthetics, I was left sick from the tonal shift and another realm endangering bullshit rather than having a single chill expansion where WoL could have adventures and experience new things together with his fellow boomer Scions, like my boys Estinien, Urianger and Thancred. To make it worse, none of it made any sense whatsoever, the second half plot was absolute bullshit, that I couldn't even digest even with suspension of disbelief. The antagonist for the first half has proven himself to be extremely competent and could've been absolutely amazing, and with his competence he could've achieved so much more and be an absolutely compelling character. Instead, he suddenly turned into an idiot with YEARS of prep time, he didn't even feel like the same character anymore. Then the whole business about the people in the new zones, it once again lacked any kind of sense, which unfortunately I can't talk about without going into full blown spoiler territory, and any kind of ""moral dillema"" it had is actually not a dilemma whatsoever if you dedicate even a moment to think about it with philosophy beyond that of a middle schooler. The only silver lining about story is that it introduced quite a few characters I liked a lot, such as Wuk Evu and Cahciua. I also think certain princess that makes an appearance later is hollow and I felt zero sympathy towards her, honestly I have no idea why people like her and why some people even dare to imply that second half is when it gets better when for me second half is what pissed me off the most about the story.I am ALMOST tempted to give this expansion a positive review, because I really enjoyed the hell out of new zones, dungeons, and HONEY B. LOVELY (I am a good little worker bee) almost made me give a positive review single-handedly, but in the end I'm leaving negative review because I am absolute pissed about Squeenix, their incompetence, and their tired old excuses. A third world modder in his basement does more than squeenix on daily basis. I get it that the engine and spaghetti code is an old amalgamation, but you can't possibly tell me that multi million dollar company can't hire a few people to figure out a way for us to have essential things like GLAMOUR LOG instead of this garbage archaic glamour system we have now where we have to keep physical copies of items and the amount of them we can store into our glam dresser being extremely limited if you play more than a few jobs. You can't possibly give me excuses why they can't give Viera and Hrothgar all hats when a single modder managed to do it, and they didn't do it in a lazy way, they actually gave the hats holes for ears and positioned them properly. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY TELL ME THAT THE ABSOLUTE HORRID STATE OF PVP WHEN IT'S FILLED WITH BLATANT CHEATERS EVEN IN CASUAL FRONTLINES AND CC IS IN ANY WAY EXCUSABLE AND THEY CAN'T DEDICATE AN INTERN TO BAN THOSE NON-HUMANS. On the same vein, you can't possibly tell me they can't dedicate an intern or two to ban all those bots infesting our soil underground and ruining the economy (inb4 another idiot tells me what it doesn't matter, a god damn economy being ruined in a god damn MMO is unimportant apparently), so yeah, despite thinking that non story content is really good so far, I'm giving this a negative review because of how much the story pissed me off and how spiteful I feel towards squeenix.Good non story content, but It's time for a lot of ya'll to stop giving squeenix excuses over blatant laziness and incompetence.

I have no issues with those.Glamour options are the usual reskins with a few awesome new ones included.Map design is great even if the first two & the first city are uninspired.90-94 is essentially a collection of irrelevant side quests masquerading as main story content.I was personally bored to tears doing these quests but I found a coping mechanism a few hours in. I loaded up Stargate & binge watched it whilst essentially ignoring the cutscenes & text. That is something I never would have dreamt of, even back in ARR. The quests were just that dull & honestly, if I wanted to be bored doing repetitive tasks I'd just go to work & get paid.In my opinion 90-94 can safely be skipped without missing any story at all and if you're on the EN dub I would actually recommend you doing so.If you enjoyed the pre-nerf cheese quest at lv30 in ARR then you'd enjoy this.94-97 is Good. This however is locked behind 10h of previous content so if you value your time more than I value mine you might just not bother getting to this point.97+ is Very Good. The zone designs, fights & enemies here are fantastic & are clearly designed by a team exceptionally competent at their job. If you're a gpose addict then this is the place in the story you will need to reach.Now, the controversial part.Wuk Lamat is just a bad character. She is a poorly written Mary-Sue who showed up out of nowhere in the last Endwalker patch, pushing two good potential new characters to the sidelines & removing the potential for the expansion to be about them.This expansion is entirely based around Lamat & your character probably has less written lines of dialogue options than this paragraph.I've seen a few reviews mocking people for saying this expansion is about Wuk Lamat but if I wanted to sit back and do nothing for hours on end without any involvement from me I'd just go and re-watch Lord of the Rings. Player involvement is what sets a video game apart from other media & Dawntrail fails to realize this.It's okay to have the player character take on a more passive role but that doesn't mean we sit on our hands whilst following her around. It means we take a different route to the usual & perhaps organise the evacuation or protect a supply chain instead of fighting this expansions big bad guy.Lamat's VA appears to have no vocal training whatsoever. This just isn't the kind of voice acting we've come to expect from this game since A Realm Reborn & quite frankly it's incredibly jarring to hear Krile or Erenville put on a fantastic performance only to be followed up by what sounds like some complete amateur they found in the bushes outside their office.I had to swap to JP voice acting for this expansion which is a shame as I've loved the previous EN voice actors but it was so immersion breaking that it just made sense to do so.This review will remain negative until the positive story content outweighs the negative in further patches.Tl;drcat hatedungeons r coolYou're probably still going to buy this anyway if you're a FF player.",1719663452,23,4,negative

76561198041891234,0,0,english,"Had a longer, messy, review written up. I have finished the MSQ and just been collecting gear since. I'll keep this to the points on why this expansion is just a full blown PTSD flashback of ARR (which is well known as the worst part of FFXIV, granted that was when they were learning what to do. There's no excuse, it's been many, many, years since then.)* This is not ""It's a new place, WOL is on vacation! People are just mad there's no world ending threat."" Once you play the story you realize this isn't the case. It's simply such a slow, boring, plot that you >hope< that's what's going on.* You spend your first few hours looking at frogs, picking plants, and playing a minigame where you look at some rocks and then confirm that yes, that boat.... is in fact a boat. Yep, that sure is an Alpaca. Etc.* You spend several, several, hours simply doing fetch quests. It's boring. In fact you do it through the entire expansion.* The entire ""storyline"" if you can call it that, is very predictable as soon as you meet the characters in the first 2 hours of playing.* You are shoehorned into being unimportant - Your character, who you pay a subscription to play, is made to feel unimportant and act as a side character. You're made to feel unimportant.* The main city design is horrid. It's so frustratingly painful to navigate that I gave up on even exploring it. It's just stairs.* The NPC (Wuk) they want you to care about is insufferable. When you meet them they are ""ha ha silly personality"" and it becomes ""Hey, Champion, babysit her."" She goes from being unable to deal with very basic situations to stealing every single moment in the spotlight from you, the WoL, after you do absolutely all of the work. In fact at the end of the MSQ you go through ALL of this trouble as the WoL to set everything right and she literally bursts in and steals all the credit. And we're supposed to enjoy her? Okay. * Wuk is literally shoved in your face at every single turn. You become the B team, and all of your favorite companions that you have grown to love over the years are put into a C team position. It's like being tied down, force fed, and being told ""enjoy this food."" The fact they simply shove you to the side and force this character in your face trying to DEMAND you enjoy them and bond with them actually makes people despise her. On Twitter you'll see people talking about how they enjoy her. In game? Here on steam? Forums? She's universally disliked. They really dropped the ball on how to introduce a new character.* Some people complain the Voice Actress who did the English voice for Wuk is bad, I think they did >okay<. Not amazing, not bad. But the character is so poorly written and forced onto you that you just don't care. * The zones are very mid. * The dialog is very poorly written. At one point there's a cutscene where someone says ""There's a time to fight and a time to withdraw. That time for you is now."" And while I understand what they MEANT....okay. Which time is now? You encounter things like this quite often.* Events feel very disorganized. * You, the savior of the star. The ender of calamities. Slayer of various gods.....are demoted to a babysitter. You're actually a babysitter. * The ""visual upgrade"" is much worse than anything you can ""alter"" yourself. Definitely not mindblowing or exciting.Good stuff?- SE Music team has never failed us. Several of the fight OSTs are absolutely on my listen to list daily.- The Trial fights are actually fun, with the last one being kind of bonkers.- The Dungeons are pretty decent, even if they went with a ""Boss attacks, does 1 big AOE, does 2 mechanics, repeats"" style.- Some of the new gear is absolutely awesome looking.- You can seriously skip every single dialog option and cutscene and still understand what's going on.TL;DR - Overall, this expansion doesn't warrant being $40. It's $19.99 at best. It doesn't even feel like an expansion. It feels like an MSQ patch. There's 100 quests and they're all abysmal and boring.

It feels like that had to reach a certian run time so padded it out to 100 quests, when the first 30-ish quests could have been over in 10.If your in it for the end game and gameplay you will probably enjoy this, but you will need to slog through a story that waits ~10 hours before being ""decent"". [h2] Rant [/h2][strike]I get not raising stakes even further, especially after last expansion. But The story starts off really Meh. and it looks like they went bigger (but barren) = better.Given who we are, being sidelined and having to take crap from characters we can stomp (and if we can't then that's just power scaling BS ) is grating. If any of the antagonists are supposed to be intimidating, uh they're not. I was kinda hoping for like, political intrigue and being torn between who to back etc etc.~~ Unfortunately it's just a lot of shonen anime weak protagonist crap with 2D villains, where we only ever hear about how cool people / things are and it's assumed we want to help and will always root for the protagonist, despite no real leg work being done to make them likeable / explain why the hell I'm okay being dragged around on their ""adventure"", doing boring busy-work.The best part (story wise) is probably the first dungeon, it is the first engaging thing in the expansion and kinda has ""Wacky Races"" vibes which is cute and adventure-y. When they said getting back to our roots as adventurers I was expecting more new undiscovered places and... IDK exploring? Not 3 hours of fetch quests / go here quests then a kinda fun dungeon.All of this is amplified by the lack of walk and talk. Walk to point A BLABLHABLAHBLAH walk to point B, BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH, Crawl half way across a map in silence to point C BLABLABLAH... you ghet the picture. So much time is spent in silent transit, then dialouge dump then silent transit. A lot of the (lets be real padding dialoufge) could probs be played while moving but that requires A). voice acting or B). smarter auto walk that avoids mobs and goes from a to b while I read text.Super upsetting that, if I wasn't with friends and looking forward to raids etc. I probably would've dropped this expansion already. Seems some people think this is just a filler ark so we shouldn't expect anything... like that's a good thing?I'll change this if it gets good enough to warrant such a meh start, but the whole mindset of oh it gets good eventually so put up with being bored for several hours.... not a fan.[/strike]",1719650043,4,0,negative

There are only four possible handpicked choices by the king three of them are his kids... three of them are good people three of them like each other. the fourth one is such an obvious villain the king could just say you know what nah and move on.

76561198049456545,0,0,english,"FFXIV is a game that has often been praised as having a good story (for an MMO) to just straight up having a good story. But it's very often a case of the good parts being good enough to overshadow the bad parts and the tedium of FFXIV's ""Go to place, talk to NPC, pick up item, give item to NPC, watch 5m long unvoiced cutscene, talk to next NPC"" storytelling. It's a very fine line FFXIV has generally managed to stay on the good side of... until nowThere's a lot to unpack here, too much for this review to not end up as an essay. I'll try keep it short. Wuk Lamat is a brand new character who has clearly ended up rubbing a lot of people the wrong way with how she is characterised in Dawntrail. The issue is the writers have gone all in on her, making her essentially the main character AND main focus of the story. Our story is meant to be 'low stakes' but this ends up as the level 90-96 story mostly consisting of performing menial chores for the sake of Wuk Lamat. At least one could praise it for having the courage to be a low stakes story after Endwalker... except then the level 97-100 story happens. If anyone tells you Dawntrail is 'low stakes', you can safely assume they have not actually finished the story. Some people might prefer this leap back to high stakes - to me it's just the writers committing to a bit for 2/3 of the expansion then chickening out at the last moment because they don't have faith in themselves to write an ending that doesn't involve saving the world. As admitted by the developers themselves, job design is not the focus on this expansion. If you have played Shadowbringers or Endwalker, you have essentially played the Dawntrail version of the jobs already. So all we have left is the raiding. And after finishing both EX trials, I can safely say.... it's good? They both demonstrate a level of creativity that I found completely lacking in Endwalker's fight design. If the savage raid design is of the same quality as the EX design, I might be able to say ""Dawntrail is a good expansion for raiders"". But raiders are still a minority of the players, and raiders will still have to go through the story. Is it worth paying full price to play through what I feel is by far the worst writing in FFXIV? No. Is it worth skipping through it to get to the endgame? Maybe if the raids are good enough. They're going to have to be good enough, because this time around ""the story is good"" is no longer something FFXIV can rely on.",1719636910,23,1,negative

76561197999715960,0,0,english,"Wait until at least 7.1 or 7.2 to buy. Out of all MSQ's, this one is easily the worst in writing and pacing; previous expansions we got to the first dungeon pretty fast and they all kicked off with a banger - Holminster and Tower of Zot were both amazing intros. This expansion, the first dungeon takes about double to triple the normal time to even reach and all the quests leading up to it are not the most well paced and written (you literally do 2 escort quests back to back and then go collect random crap to complete the XIV equivalent of One Small Favor which spans 2 whole quest arcs and then you will finally do the dungeon).  New characters are also not the most well written either. Some scenes will make you cringe because of how poorly acted or written it is. Pretty much the only thing that will save this expansion are the raid and savage tiers.Edit: I also have over 6000 hours in XIV and I will defend my statement that this MSQ is seriously the worst they've ever done.Edit 2: Getting over the initial slog, there are some genuine good bits to the writing. However, we are now back to where we started with ARR. It's not fair or right to tell people they have to suffer through hours and hours of absolute garbage to get to the good parts. As to Wuk's voice actress, the lines themselves aren't bad and she did a good job with some of them. The issue I have is that she fails to maintain consistency, and some lines are just completely out of whack. Everything compounded together is just a slog to get through.

I'll try to type this with as minimum spoilers as possible, much like everyone else I went in fully aware that it was going to be hard to top Shadowbringers and Endwalkers epic conclusion to a story in the writing for 14 years! (1.0 released in September 2010).This expansion pack reminds me a lot of what ARR did where it's rough around the edges at the beginning of the game till it starts to pick.I think each new character had great potential by the second half they're really good enjoyable characters, the first half the story is treated like a filler episode of an anime while the second half picks up strong setting up for an entirely new story.The expansion to me personally is 7.5/10 review score, but a good 7.5/10 review score.

76561198001218206,163792,696,english,"The fights are really good, when they happen. The music is great. On to the downsides:Here are some principles to follow for a story-based MMORPG - principles, I must add, that were demonstrated very well in every previous FFXIV expansion:1. MMORPGs are about combat first. Not the MMO part nor even the RP part - but the G part. The game. The fighting. The part of the product where you are [i]doing[/i] something.2. The characters that are key to the plot of the story must be interesting. They don't even necessarily need to have ""character development"", although it is a good idea. Character development is meaningless if the character is uninteresting in the first place.3. The player must be made to feel that their presence in the story is meaningful.Dawntrail is a narrative disaster that fails on all of these principles. My disappoint is immeasurable and my day is, as you may expect, ruined.It fails on principle 1:Because combat is treated more like an inconvenient necessity in the MSQ than as something you should ostensibly enjoy. You can proceed through the ENTIRE MSQ having defeated fewer than 100 enemies outside of duties - I'm pretty sure I did, and not because I wanted to avoid fighting! In fact, there is a noticeable scarcity of unique enemy types present in EVERY Dawntrail zone. Hope you like the cute bat things in the final zone, because they're one of only 5-6 ""standard enemies"" in the zone, total.It fails on principle 2:Because every important character in Dawntrail is bland or self-contradictory in a manner that indicates incompetence. But for the sake of keeping this review from spilling into novel-length territory, yes, Wuk Lamat is the greatest offender. She only has one character flaw (insecurity about how she is perceived as a would-be leader) and that becomes resolved early on in the MSQ. For the entirety of the MSQ, she is a perfect little cinnamon roll, a hecking wholesome chungus worth all the updoots. She just loves her nation's people so much and cares about every little thing and always knows the right thing to say! Everyone loves her (except the bad guy)! Don't you love her too?!? This is commonly known as a ""Mary Sue"". Wuk could have had an interesting flaw, or multiple flaws, and developed as a person over the entirety of the MSQ. She could have been arrogant and had to learn that to lead a nation requires a balance of pride in nation and humility in self. She could have learned that her cluelessness about how to lead indicated that she was uneducated in things like economics, logistics and the needs of a diverse people. She could have been racist and had to learn how all of the nation's peoples were valuable contributors to the nation's welfare! But no. She throws pity parties, until she doesn't, and then she's a blameless, faultless Hercules. Wuk Lamat has a lot of fans, which I am certain is for two reasons:1. She is the player's introduction to the long-awaited female hrothgar.2. She's cute and sweet (although I don't see the cute part outside of the kitty face).That's all it takes to have your character praised if you've got the kind of audience before which you can simply jangle keys. Jangle them keys.It fails on principle 3:Because your character well and truly does not matter. It's not your story in any regard. Heavensward is the story of the long-running animosity between the knights of Ishgard and the dragons, and you play a key role in that. Shadowbringers is the story of a world fallen out of balance by nefarious forces, and you play a key role in that. Dawntrail is the story of how a perfect little princess goes on an adventure, and you... are dragged along for the ride. With such consistency, I might add, that there is very little relief from the 'babysitting' that many, many other reviewers mention. And it is relieving indeed. This is a product for which the Jangling Keys Enjoyers have had to issue a great volume of what's known as ""cope""; poor rationalizations for why it's ok that this product is bad, and that it's good, actually. Unfortunately, all of their arguments boil down to saying, ""you expected to be a hero like in the core game and the last 4 expansions? You expected the story to involve you? Heh, don't you know that your WoL is on 'holiday'?""No reductive smugness will change that my Final Fantasy involves going on adventures and being a hero, but unlike ARR, Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers AND Endwalker, this doesn't feel like a very fun fantasy. I'm just glad that my MSQ is over.One final sad note: This is well outside the scope of product for which the reasonable reaction to dislike would be to simply not play it. Because Dawntrail is a permanent part of the game, now. It's now a black mark in the process of experiencing the game. You'll have to grimace at every new player you recruit, knowing that when they come off the high of Shadowbringers and Endwalker back-to-back, they can look forward to several hours of the game's weakest-ever content. I wonder if it's possible for Yoshi P to pull a second ARR. I'm speaking in serious tones because I love FFXIV as a whole. I think it's the greatest MMORPG of all time, and I have played a whole lot of MMORPGs. XIV deserves better than Dawntrail, and so do the Warriors of Light that have journeyed through an epic's worth of curated story and the hundreds of duties that came with it.====================Original review follows below:The story is all about the worst main character they've ever written and the long beginning stretch of the story involves learning about peaceful cultures where nothing, or close to nothing, is going wrong, while you fight nothing. The early zones are not interesting or dangerous in any fashion, and the cultures you spend the time getting to know are simply not enough to carry the experience.I just have a sinking feeling as I continue. I NEED to see the story pick up and Wuk Lamat somehow transform into a remotely likeable character, and I don't think it's going to happen.

I spent 5 hours today running between NPCs and watching cutscenes that were around 5 minutes long each, why in 2024 is only 10% of the cutscenes voiced? Surely Square have enough resources and support for this game for it to be all MSQ cutscenes? I can only assume its either laziness or money scrounging. I'm watching characters here that have previously had voices in some cutscenes suddenly stop having voices. On top of that, during my questing I only killed 3 mobs for a single quest and collected a few leaves to make up for gameplay (genuinely 2 MSQ quests with actual gameplay!), both of which only took around 1 minute each. Tell me, in what world is 2 minutes of gameplay during 5 hours acceptable? Even then, that gameplay was very lacklustre.I know, why didn't I do sidequests to break up the monotony? I wanted to save them for another job. Why do all the content on my main job, after all a big part of this game is about being able to playing multiple jobs.The story wasn't even interesting enough for me to want to keep playing to find out what happens.
