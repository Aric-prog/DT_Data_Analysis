However, going back through a second time with some friends just starting the game I had to take a step back and look at the reasons why I was peeved at it.   No matter which way I cut it, it was my own expectations which let me down.   I mean how many universe and world ending situations do we need to be happy.  And if the whole expansion was just sitting on a beach sipping mai tais and playing shuffle board, people would complain about no meaningful things for us to do.  Cant have a whole expansion of gold saucer 2.0, we need to do -something- and trouble always follows so that is expected.  The player character doesn't get to have nice things.   They are earmarked by the universe to suffer a lot and that is what this is.  More suffering, and if you look at it from that lens, its not being cynical, it is on par for what the character is constantly dealing with from a story perspective and from that angle, its not that bad at all.  Again, they do not get to have nice things, including a 'nice' vacation.  This is weekend at Bernie's guys.  Let it ride.\n\nI could do without the damn follow missions though.  That is more annoying than innovative.\n\nThe zones are pretty streamlined.  The dungeons are pretty fun and so is the later content.  How can you not jam out to honey b lovely.  There will be more content to come and its not too late to salvage the story bits and bobs, but we have to express a slight amount of patience right. . .  how could any story we play through compare to just saving two planets and a whole universe more or less.  Its hard to meet the expectations of that build up that has been gassing up for 10 years and expect the next toss to be JUST as good as a decade of a story.   It started pretty slow too but it made sense in the end.  Be honest, when you were rocking out a real reborn would you have expected or anticipated heavens ward or shadowbringers? \n Would you have said at that moment you would be sobbing on the long walk in ultima thul - no I wouldnt have thought that at all.   In ARR I did not like any of those characters either.  This is the start of another story and if the design team for this sandbox does anything good, its learning from what mistakes they have made and to try and provide a quality experience and build upon it.\n\ntl;dr:  Any new story in this game cycle would be hard to match up to provide the same satisfaction to the past 10 years of overarching narrative that just got wrapped up - and the actual gameplay content is still fun and continues to offer fun new sights and excitements.  Except those damn follow missions.  They can go to hells.\n", "timestamp_created": 1728546795, "timestamp_updated": 1728546795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454297780990600586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176715081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065017248", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 103118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1137, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "Spielerisch bis dato sogar die beste Expansion, Story technisch leider ein wenig mau aber immernoch gut genug um es enjoyen zu k\u00f6nnen, insbesondere die 2te H\u00e4lfte nimmt echt Fahrt auf.", "timestamp_created": 1728503331, "timestamp_updated": 1728503331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526328384876251221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176688912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029231349", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 100958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1564, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean it's alright like", "timestamp_created": 1728473227, "timestamp_updated": 1728473227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526893854141235352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176658126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024151834", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 432461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 880, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The story of this expansion isn't great, but the dungeons, raids, and job changes are some of the best in the game.

Maybe it doesn't feed into the power fantasies of some or the more likely case, these people saying the story was weak just skipped it.\n\nI personally found the story to be great, in fact, its up there with Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Lets be real, If we were to have yet another story where its basically the exact same formula, it would be boring. This expansion brings to you a new experience, not as the warrior of light but as a mentor in the story where, through your actions and experience, you help a character grow into a hero. The start is slow, yes, but Dawntrail is the start of a new adventure, in other words this should be treated the same as ARR, the foundation of the story where the following expansions will hit hard.\n\nMY ONLY ISSUE is that Y'shtola's english voice actor sounded a bit off, but that negligible. (I think it was something to do with the studio she was in, noticeable echo)\n\nSo yeah, story was great, If you think it sucked, then good for you I guess? Pound sand, respectfully.\n\nThe dungeons were amazing, I love the improved battle mechanics where AOE's from bosses are not just orange shapes on the ground but instead shown through their actions. This made the dungeons less brainless and more engaging. This system gets even better with the trials. I am excited to experience more dungeons and raids with these kind of mechanics.\n\nThe music is seriously one of the strongest parts to the game, the dungeon music is great and good god are the trial OST's reaching new levels of peak.\n\nOn an emotional level, Dawntrail has made me cry D:\n\nOverall, I seriously recommend this expansion, but do not recommend skipping the story. For an expansion that a good handful of people called terrible, it only shows that they skipped through major parts of the story and got lost in the end. So lets not send death threats to the team behind the game, this is not the friendly FFXIV community I know :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1728328592, "timestamp_updated": 1728328592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493658840656280518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176566412", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986357134", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!", "timestamp_created": 1728310658, "timestamp_updated": 1728310658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176496175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037565634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the gear and story in this expansion!!

Well.. I usually play in Japanese voice acting but i really wanted to hear the hubub about Wuk Lamat, and oh my lord everybody is 100% right it was so bad holy moly, Apart from that the story itself is really boring too, took me 3 and a half hours of story/cutscene watching and fetching to kill 1 mob for a quest objective YIKES..

From the zones, music, fashion designs, linguistics involved in naming versus presentation, and so on, you can really feel the love and care put into making up for earlier expansion shortcomings in making sensitive choices with respect and research to the people whose fantasies they represent. I didn't expect nearly all of the Americas as they were to have a fantasy here, let alone a complex representation of diaspora that is so common among the stories and legacies of many within the Caribbean, South America, and beyond. \n\nI love Tural and I hope to see more of it even outside of MSQ content, given its massive size in this universe. At the very least show us some of the Northern climates or the vast deserts that they hint at. (It reaches from the north to the south poles!) Beyond that, I found many of the themes and characters surrounding love and unity to be very touching. For this reason, Part 1 (Yak Tural) for the Rite of Succession is 9/10 for me.\n\nPart 2 (Xak Tural) feels like it suffers two glaring problems: Pacing and Priorities. The story evolves into itself at rapid pace and the fun exploratory worldbuilding surrounding the first half of the expansion falls to the wayside for questlines that are either end-of-the-world or completely unrelated filler with almost no in-between. I found myself questioning why the Rite of Succession left out the peoples here when they were part of Tural's unity and made up huge swathes of its capital city's demographics. I wondered why we had only begun learning the history and complex motivations surrounding a major villain in the 30 second lead up prior to fighting them. I wondered why we were not shown more of the visual horror surrounding the iconography of a major character tethered to Solution 9 and its people, etc.\n\nThis half suffers not from a lack of good ideas, but from a rather peculiar way of showcasing them, in what order, and either with a lot of build-up or absolutely zero at all. To me it feels like they ran out of time to do all the things they wanted with Xak Tural before release and that these may have been shifted as things to be explored in the post-MSQ patch series. With that in mind for the initial experience, the battle content, big major scenes, and presentation was all memorable! But felt quite unearned with how fast it occurred in a lot of places. For that reason, Part 2 of DT (Xak Tural) is a solid 6/10 at best for me.\n\nI admit I have a bias starting from the first sentence of this review. I love JRPG tales about friendship and love (FF8 was my first) and especially worldbuilding. I've nothing to say about the voice acting other than that the VAs were all great picks, it was just the voice direction that needed work in some parts (I wish ENG Gulool Ja Ja was as vocally bombastic as his JP counterpart prior to Mamook, for example). I've played this expansion twice now both in JP and ENG and found that characters matched each other's vibes and energies well.\n\nAll in all, Dawntrail is an 8/10 for me and within my top three of favorite expansions for the foreseeable future (so long as the post-MSQ content doesn't radically alter my opinions for better or worse).

In extremes & savage, there is little repetition of mechanics and when they are repeated it's often with a twist applied. There is far less reliance on body checks to halt progression and as a whole savage has been much more fun and a lot less miserable/frustrating. For regular content like dungeons, I feel a lot less fatigue with the Lv.100 Expert dungeons compared to the EW equivalents (Stigma Dreamscape and Smileton).\n\n+ Some graphics update features were quite good; additional grass/foliage adds a lot to scenes in a subtle way, a lot of effects and locales look a bit better (but not universal). On the whole good changes, though some tweaks were not to everyone's liking and some oddities exist.\n\n+ The new zones look cool and have nice vibes to them\n\n+ Role Quests were good fun this time around.\n\nNegatives\n- Poor MSQ story structure and character building; there was a lot of promise in the concepts and characters, but the way events and moments were laid out and presented ultimately bungled that potential. The way in which the player engaged with the story through tasks, instanced battles, etc. was also quite poorly set out with a lot of reliance on dialogue & fetch quests, not a lot of innovation on those tasks, and not peppering enough combat in the right places to help alleviate it. Instanced battles were also quite repetitive; the player fights the same enemy type in the first 3 battle instances, with 1 & 3 being mostly the same, and 2 forcing a moveset that's 1 button with very little cooldowns to use.\n\n- Job design had little rework; long standing issues from as far back as ShB are still present in some, like MCH's disjointed AOE issues and wildfire being a problem for those with high latency. Most jobs were given a lazy addition of a few follow-up actions on their existing actions, some of which exacerbate issues they had in EW (Reaper's burst, for instance, is quite rigid and having a follow-up added to the very end makes it even more so). Damage potencies on jobs have gotten even higher, leading to heavier swings in damage variance for those without guaranteed critical hits and more heavily punishing players if they slip out of the shared 2-min damage windows.\n\n- Graphics Update implementation left a lot to be desired; some crucial options missing (bloom intensity for instance), and the technology used for AA relies on motion blur (TMAA) which strains the eyes. Some players have been driven out of the game because of that issue alone. As for me, I had to go back down to FXAA and tinker around to find a good balance. Audio continues to be muddy in a lot of places. Some locations and lighting look quite flat (Quicksand for instance) or outright bad (off the top of my head, the lighting in Brute Justice's arena is very dark).\n\n- The two-dye channel implementation has been quite questionable for a lot of pieces of equipment; some resort to setting the 2nd dye channel to be something asinine like the thread on buttons rather than something more prominent. Other pieces that would have benefited greatly from a 2nd dye channel, on the other hand, have been left with 1. In general, a bit of a baffling set of decisions were made.\n\n- This is a personal opinion, but I feel zones are needlessly large and it hinders adding personal touches and flair to them. ARR zones continue to be the best in the game for all their little locales, attention to detail, and special FATEs that actually influence the settlements and areas around them. Since HW, most zones (not all) have suffered from just feeling like giant maps with enemy groups spattered throughout them. ARR zones, on the other hand, have enemies that feel like they're native to the area, mixing together, and factions in small camps tucked away into the corners.\n\n\nOverall\nIt's an odd one; some aspects seem great and are moving in the right direction, while other aspects are stagnating or getting worse. The change in fight design, if it holds, will help immensely going through the middle and end of the expansion; particularly if it extends to the upcoming field operation. I feel that's more important overall than the MSQ quality, but it'll likely leave a sour taste in people's mouths if it doesn't show improvement. I've a feeling there are some good ideas in the works, but if they aren't executed correctly then it's going to be really disappointing.", "timestamp_created": 1727287125, "timestamp_updated": 1727287125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693718791007995605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "175741703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123956763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a slow burn thats for sure but once it pops it is great legit has me smiling seeing everything come together.", "timestamp_created": 1727266286, "timestamp_updated": 1727266286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "175604112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051739360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I do recommend this game for anyone who enjoys final fantasy xiv, the story isnt as bad as people make it out to be but it isnt as great in parts as the last 2 before it, which is somewhat a unfair comparrisson, considering they had the lore and story from the past previous expansions to build up on, Endwalker being the \"End\" of that story for the most part and Dawntrail being the ARR of the new one.

Here are my thoughts after spending 100 + hours on Dawntrail.\n\nStory: The story is bad. Period. Anyone who claims otherwise under the guise of, \"it's a new adventure it's supposed to be slow\", \"you can't compare it to shadow bringers and endwalker that was a culmination of 10 years of story...\" either has no idea what components and ideas make a good story or they refuse to take off their rose tinted glasses because they believe Yoshi-P and his dev team can do no wrong. There is a way to write stories that are slow that make you question the narative and entice you to dig deep and understand the entire picture. Every FF expansion does this EXCEPT Dawntrail. If you asked people what they think the main theme is to every FF expansion you'll likely get different answers because there are many themes and many ideas that make you question what is right and what is wrong. Dawntrail does that for about 1/20 of the story near the end, the rest of Dawntrails story theme boils down to \"If We UnDeRsTaNd EaChOtHeR We WiLl AlL GeT AlOnG\" And it is forcefully shoved in your face throughout the entire expansion when you are not doing completely mundane tasks. \n\nQuest Design: Uninspired, I'm not saying the other expansions had better quest design but when there is a good story that keeps you intrigued uninspired quest design can be forgiven. When the story literally makes you fall asleep or makes you want to walk away and play a different game, have uninspired quests can be a deal breaker, and many times during my play sessions it was. I literally had to stop and just go do something else. It took me a month to finally finish the story out of sheer will. \n\nTrials/Dungeons/New Raid: Now with the absolute pitfall of a story and boring quest design there is a ton of positives when it comes to the Trials/Dungeons/Raids. They are absolutely fantastic. Well balanced, semi difficult, and good music. They absolutely nailed it with the actual game play. This alone makes me still recommend this expansion.\n\nOverall Thoughts: The story of Dawntrail is an example of poor writing. Make any excuse you want, the actual narative and writing of this story is fundamentally bad. Many people blame it on the character Wuk Lamat but even if you replaced her with a well voiced character that would not change the foundational issues with the character and the story. The quest design needs to improve. In this day and age having generic fetch quests, kill quests, etc. will lose players. Yes I understand that these quests build upon the lore and have meaning behind the story which makes them better than most mmorpgs but that doesn't matter. There is a better way to tell the story from boring unimaginative quest design and hours of cutscenes. If they don't change that in the future then FF14 will start to go down the path of WOW where everyone rushes through the story just to get to the \"real game.\" I would hate to see this wonderfully narrative focused game to go down that path. I still hold Yoshi-P and his Dev team in high regards and the reason why I am very critical of this expansions story is because I know that this Dev team is capable of writing complex and compelling stories. With that being said the actual endgame of Dawntrail so far has been wonderful and for that reason alone this gets my recommendation. But for anyone who buys this expansion or plays ff14 just for the story be warned. The story of Dawntrail is mediocre at best and abysmal at it's worst. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1727053889, "timestamp_updated": 1727053889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476022869348526001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "175506355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135552905", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 13886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2251, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I had fun and hope to see more new content in the future", "timestamp_created": 1726975411, "timestamp_updated": 1726975411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803258657455444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "175397651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850270853", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "[SPOILER ALERT] When I first got into the dlc I had a very bad expectations thanks to all the fuss and drama. I've been sick which allowed me to finish the story in one go in 4 days and I'll be honest if this is what is called \"ABYSSMAL DOGSHIT!\" \"POOR WRITING!\" \"THE WORST MMO DLC EVER!!!!\" nowdays then I'm starting to lose the hope in humanity.\n\nThe first half of dlc is a solid roadmovie where you visit all the nations of Tuliyolal and learn about their culture while helping Wuk Lamat compete in Rite Of Succession. During the rite you complete quests and solve problems of these nations and by doing that you come to understand their culture and customs all of that forms the main theme of Dawntrail that is \"Only by understanding and respecting each others traditions we can achieve peace\". Somehow that philosophy is wrong for someone or its not \"realistic\", well if you want real politics you can look in the window, because this is the whole point the lesson that Gurool Ja Ja tried to teach his Promises and that only Wuk Lamat could understand because others tried to scheme or brute force their way through the rite while Wuk Lamat being neither strongest nor smartest but by being honest and friendly get herself friends and connections because when you think of it Wuk Lamat didn't do anything except swinging her axe for the whole thing while scions, us and others did all the dirty job that allowed her to go through all trials. But isn't it exactly what leader is supposed to do? Treat others with respect to rely on them and divide power between capable people to ahieve the result? And the fact that she awknowledges her own flaws and makes Koana the Vow Of Reason for the better of the nation is alone shows how much she grows as a character in comparison to what we started. And yet some people still struggle to see that probably because its hard to relate to big furry cat or trans VA or something idk what happens in the heads of the \"BASED\" people who seriously think that Serious Sam, Postal or Duke Nukem are peak of gaming. Not to mention numerous other characters having their arcs that trace throrought the whole dlc and have their conclusion and somehow people still pissed because their favourite Scions did nothing and didn't get their screen time yeah I wonder why new characters with new arcs dominate in the new dlc when old characters had their arcs developed for the PAST TEN (10) YEARS, seriously people bring up NUMBER OF VOICELINES SAID by characters saying that Wuk Lamat being at the top is somehow takes away all the time from others but would they try to look at GLOBAL amount of lines said by characters in all story they would probably find Urianger's or Minfilia's blabbering on the top and that is somehow is different (Btw Sphene is 2nd place with half as much dialogue because she is literally is Wuk Lamat's antipod and theirs is the main story conflict but this is for later). All of that just to justify the \"boredom\" these players feel probably having 5 minute tiktok attention span for doing small unimportant tasks in an goddamn MMO the genre that's whole philosophy is built upon that you as player must by doing small unrelated unimportant tasks level up and build your strengh to face the gods. Yes without all that shit if they'd just allowed you always do interesting shit like dungeons or raids they would neither been interesting nor had any meaning. And that whole thing about doing quests to gain characters trust and friendship is still somehow different that what you've been doing in Ala Mhigo, Doma, Ishgard, Garlemald and so on. Okay next goes the little Western arc that people call \"filler\" even though it moves the Namikka arc, Erenvile arc and introduces you to characters that will later help breach the barrier and defend Xak Tural later on. Even referencing ShB and just like in ShB you get this cool moment where all characters gather to build something so you can access new dungeon which is epic. Somehow once again these people don't get enough fanservice even tho there is shitton of it like when Endwalker starts playing and dragons appear in the skies or the whole Alexandria thing being one big tribute to FF9. Then begins the second part of story which introduces the said Alexandria and queen Sphene that questions the story theme and creates a very dramatic conflict between her and Wuk Lamat. There we dispose of chaotic evil trash that being Zoral Ja that some people believe is the main antagonist for some reason (which obviously is Sphene and not Zoral Ja) and for some reason people compare him to Emet-Selch (are you stupid?). Zoral Ja is a typical chaotic evil psychopath that was created by failing to live up to people's expectations that turned him into hating everything and doing all the shit he did the only purpose of these characters is to become a quick fun encounters for us to beat the shit of them and feel good about it (and yet its still somehow different from Zenos or Ilberd), it is exactly because there are all these different shades of evil that allow us to appreciate villains like Emet-Selch or Sphene or Hermes. And then even he gets his arc awknologing his child and passing his bloody legacy to him in the end. Then we get to the PEAK when we enter the city of gold the living memory where all the Endless are and that is one big tribute to FF9. This zone is something special, the feels it gives by just being there vibing to music and the unimaginable work of artists deserving to be exhibited in museums. All of that beauty that you yourself destroy freeing all the Endless's souls just to turn in all to black, devoted of colors, souless monument without music and that hits SO HARD and that thing alone justifies whatever shit that happened in the story. How would you possibly complain about that? And still some people tell that it should have been different that \"What right we have to \"kill\" all these \"living\" people to save our own. Did we become Emet-Selch ourselves?\", that we should have found a way to save everyone. No dipshits this conflict was built like it should have been what else you think supposed to happen when Sphene herself said that she is no more than \"bearer of real Queen Sphene memories\" and that Preservation intentionally created her to be a mechanism that is whole purpose is to find a way to sustain the Endless and the only way is to feed them with Aether which means to destroy your own world? She even went as far to ask you \"Could you have done different?\" and the answer is no you yourself killed Emet-Selch, Elidibus and Lahabrea in the same manner who's goal was too to deliver his breathren at any cost by rejoining the world. This living memory is just Amaurot 2 that filled with artificial constructs of people's memories trying to simulate \"what ifs\" while feeding on a Aether of living beings. This is another impossible Utopia like what Ascians tried to achieve, saving it its like saying Arasaka in cp2077 is good. \"When one nation wishes to destroy another war happenes\" so the best we can do is to understand and remember that they existed same like with Emet-Selch.

Instead, it places you in a more supportive role, focusing on trials, cultural exploration, and personal connections. For me, the slower pace of the story made the adventure enjoyable, especially as the final quarter of the game shifts gears, introducing more tension and mystery.\n\nWhile the number of dungeons and trials may be limited, they stand out for their increased difficulty. Unlike previous expansions where I could breeze through them, DawnTrail demanded my full attention. The emotional depth of the story towards the end struck a chord with me, making me tear up as it reflected relatable struggles. The unexpected twists and the emotional climax made the ending truly memorable, surpassing even Stormblood in my personal ranking.\n\nNow, onto some constructive criticism. There's been a lot of polarized reactions, with people either loving or hating the expansion\u2014sometimes for reasons that feel unwarranted. For example, some have criticized the voice actor who plays Wuk Lamat for being trans. This comment from people can be ignored. Frankly, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue. While I found Wuk Lamat a bit overly positive at times, that\u2019s more a writing choice than a performance problem. Ill will say there is a moment at the end where thought \" very odd and a little forced\". There were moments when her delivery felt flat, and I think the direction could have been stronger. On the other hand, Y\u2019shtola\u2019s audio quality was disappointing\u2014it sounded compressed, as if it wasn\u2019t recorded in a studio, which I hope gets patched in an update.\n\nA few plot points in the latter half of the story felt forced, as if they were written to move the narrative forward without fully making sense. Despite these issues, I had a lot of fun with DawnTrail. It may not reach the heights of Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but it's a solid start to a new arc. I\u2019m excited to see where the story goes next and to experience the emotions the writers aim to evoke. Does it have flaws? Yes. But is it a bad expansion?

I play FF 14 for over 10 years and I'm still in love with the game. I understand that people are not happy with Wuk Lamat but I think a big part is the poor performance of her English VA (voiceactor). I play with japanese dub and english subtitles right now. In Endwalker both was set on english but the recent change in performancequality was just too big for me. If a character like Wuk Lamat takes the spotlight, the VA has to be on top of his/her game. But that's sadly not the case. \n\nGameplay is still the same as always. The classes get new and fancy spells, new dungeons/trials with fun mechanics, plenty of sidecontent and a story worth listening to. It's a shame so many people hate on the game but in comparison to the older addons it's a solid expansion 7.5/10. It's not revolutionary or the best I ever played but I can guarantee everyone who's not sure if he/she should get the game don't worry.

I've played for about 5k-ish hours, done several pieces of side content to completion, and have a pretty good grasp on the story. \n\nThe story for this expac is not as good as ShB or Endwalker. Yes, they're trying something somewhat new, and while that was the end of a decade long story, this is trying to do something different. \n\nMy issue, and a lot of other people's, is how the WoL is treated and Wuk Lamat (oh boy). Personally, I'm completely fine with having my character take a step back and getting to a sort of normalcy in the MSQ that you didn't really see since the first part of ARR. You're just a normal adventurer, doin' normal tasks and not treated like the gods' gift to earth. My issue is that I don't think Wuk Lamat can carry the story on her back considering how much free time is given to her. Her story feels like it stopped evolving halfway and it gets very bland when the story actually gets kind of cool. The voice acting is also questionable, but I blame bad direction. \n\nContent-wise, it's great. I'm glad we have more difficult encounters in normal content now, and the raid series is actually quite fun this time around. But that's outside of the normal MSQ questing that can be as monotonous as ever. It can get pretty bad. Personally I blame the lack of more instanced fights. There's maybe 2-3 the entire MSQ. A lot of quests end up being \"talk to three NPCs, where one of them has actually useful information.\"\n\nMy normal, \"should you buy this\" doesn't work here since the other DLCs are bundled into this. There's no point in skipping an entire expac. As MSQ goes, it's definitely weaker than the last two expacs, but Im hopeful in terms of content. Plus, this is still excluding the patch quests.

I guess some people lack basic reading comprehension. Anyways, Dawntrail is a great feel-good story that achieves its mission statement of being a much more relaxed and less dire scenario, it was never going to reach the same heights as ShB or EW because it was never meant to, we just watched the overarching plot of the last 4 expansions and base game be resolved, it's time for a break. It's paced very well, you don't dawdle in any one area overly long, the story beats are all very well done even if you can see one or two coming, there were even two particularly emotional bits in particular that got my eyes genuinely watering. Soken as per usual killed it with the music and both new classes are a blast to play. The new locales are gorgeous and the climax and post-story dungeons and raids are all excellent, there's also a LOT of FFIX love in there that will make any fan smile. Also Wuk Lamat is a great character, she has very real growth over the course of the story and isn't the 'Mary Sue' people make her out to be, the fact the same people that complain about how 'awful' she is also directly harass her VA for 'ruining' the character should tell you all you need. I don't like to address people whinging over nothing in reviews because that ultimately has nothing to do with the actual game, but with the blatant review bombing DT has gotten I feel it prudent to point out that the whinging will only ever be just that, and the personal failings of people to manage their expectations is not reflective of what is a very well done expansion.", "timestamp_created": 1725311190, "timestamp_updated": 1725311190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472985565662384033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "174084764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120062912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This DLC is pretty neat.

Als vierte gro\u00dfe Erweiterung nach Shadowbringers und Endwalker war die Erwartungshaltung der Fans entsprechend hoch. Nach dem emotionalen Abschluss der langen Geschichte um Hydaelyn und Zodiark bringt Dawntrail die Spieler in neue Gebiete und bietet ihnen die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Welt von Eorzea weiter zu erkunden, nun jedoch mit einem frischen Abenteuergef\u00fchl und einer neuen, unverbrauchten Handlung.\n\nGeschichte und Setting:\n\nDie Geschichte von Dawntrail entf\u00fchrt die Spieler in eine bisher unerforschte Region der Welt, bekannt als Tural. Diese neue Welt ist von tropischen W\u00e4ldern, weitl\u00e4ufigen Str\u00e4nden und uralten Tempeln gepr\u00e4gt. Das Setting erinnert an s\u00fcdamerikanische und mesoamerikanische Kulturen, was sich in der Architektur, den Kost\u00fcmen und den Br\u00e4uchen der dortigen Bev\u00f6lkerung widerspiegelt. Es ist eine willkommene Abwechslung von den bisherigen Schaupl\u00e4tzen, die oft eher europ\u00e4ische oder asiatische Einfl\u00fcsse aufwiesen.\n\nDie Handlung selbst dreht sich um eine mysteri\u00f6se Prophezeiung, die das Ende eines Zeitalters und den Aufstieg eines neuen Herrschers vorhersagt. Die Spieler werden in die Rolle eines Abenteurers gedr\u00e4ngt, der mit der Aufgabe betraut ist, die Zukunft dieser neuen Welt zu bestimmen. Die Geschichte ist weniger d\u00fcster als die vorherigen Erweiterungen und vermittelt stattdessen ein Gef\u00fchl von Aufbruch und Abenteuer. Dennoch fehlt es nicht an dramatischen Wendungen und tiefgr\u00fcndigen Charaktermomenten, die die Spieler in ihren Bann ziehen.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIm Gameplay von Dawntrail hat Square Enix bew\u00e4hrte Mechaniken beibehalten und gleichzeitig neue Elemente eingef\u00fchrt, um das Spielerlebnis frisch zu halten. Die Erweiterung bringt zwei neue Klassen, die beide sorgf\u00e4ltig gestaltet wurden, um verschiedene Spielstile zu bedienen. Die Viper, eine DPS-Klasse, die sich auf schnelle Angriffe und hohe Mobilit\u00e4t konzentriert, und der Geomant, ein Support-Job, der mit Elementarmagie und Heilf\u00e4higkeiten gl\u00e4nzt, bieten sowohl f\u00fcr Neulinge als auch f\u00fcr Veteranen neue Herausforderungen.\n\nDie neuen Gebiete in Tural sind weitl\u00e4ufig und laden zur Erkundung ein. Die Vielfalt an Landschaften, von dichten Dschungeln bis hin zu alten Ruinen, bietet den Spielern zahlreiche M\u00f6glichkeiten, sich in der Welt zu verlieren. Das Erkunden dieser Gebiete ist ein zentrales Element der Erweiterung, wobei die Spieler ihre bisherigen Mounts und Fortbewegungsmittel weiterhin nutzen k\u00f6nnen, um die weitl\u00e4ufigen Areale zu durchqueren.\n\nEin bemerkenswerter Aspekt von Dawntrail sind die neuen Dungeons und Raids, die auf eine Mischung aus herausfordernden K\u00e4mpfen und cleverem Design setzen. Die Dungeons sind weniger auf Open-World-Elemente ausgelegt, sondern bieten durchdachte, instanzierte Erfahrungen, die sowohl taktisches Geschick als auch Teamarbeit erfordern. Die Entwickler haben dabei ein gutes Gleichgewicht zwischen fordernden Bossk\u00e4mpfen und R\u00e4tseln gefunden, die das Tempo des Spiels abwechslungsreich gestalten.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich bringt Dawntrail auch Verbesserungen in der Handwerks- und Sammelmechanik mit sich. Es gibt neue Rohstoffe, die gesammelt und verarbeitet werden k\u00f6nnen, sowie anspruchsvolle Rezepte, die die Kreativit\u00e4t und Geduld der Spieler auf die Probe stellen.\n\nGrafik und Sound:\n\nGrafisch zeigt Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail erneut, warum es eines der sch\u00f6nsten MMORPGs auf dem Markt ist. Die Entwickler haben sichtlich viel Zeit in die Gestaltung der neuen Welt Tural investiert. Die detaillierte Flora und Fauna, die leuchtenden Farben der Landschaften und die lebendige Darstellung der St\u00e4dte und D\u00f6rfer tragen dazu bei, dass sich die Spieler in diese neue Region vollst\u00e4ndig eintauchen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAuch die Charaktermodelle und Animationen sind von hoher Qualit\u00e4t, was besonders bei den neuen Klassen auff\u00e4llt. Die Viper bewegt sich mit einer flie\u00dfenden Eleganz, die ihren Kampfstil unterstreicht, w\u00e4hrend der Geomant durch seine majest\u00e4tischen Zauberanimationen beeindruckt.\n\nDer Soundtrack von Dawntrail ist, wie von Final Fantasy XIV gewohnt, herausragend. Komponist Masayoshi Soken hat erneut einen Soundtrack geschaffen, der sowohl epische Momente als auch ruhige, besinnliche Augenblicke perfekt untermalt. Die Musik wechselt nahtlos zwischen heiteren Melodien und dramatischen St\u00fccken, je nachdem, was die Handlung erfordert, und bleibt dabei immer im Ged\u00e4chtnis.\n\nCommunity und Multiplayer-Erfahrung:\n\nDie Community von Final Fantasy XIV ist bekannt f\u00fcr ihre Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft, und Dawntrail macht hier keine Ausnahme. Die neuen Gruppeninhalte, wie die extremen Pr\u00fcfungen und Raids, f\u00f6rdern das kooperative Spielen und belohnen Spieler, die sich gut abstimmen und zusammenarbeiten.\n\nSquare Enix hat au\u00dferdem das Matchmaking-System weiter verbessert, um Neulingen den Einstieg zu erleichtern und das Erlebnis f\u00fcr erfahrene Spieler angenehmer zu gestalten. Die neuen sozialen Features, wie erweiterte Gildenh\u00e4user und verbesserte Chat-Funktionen, tragen ebenfalls dazu bei, das Gemeinschaftsgef\u00fchl zu st\u00e4rken.\n\nFazit:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail ist eine herausragende Erweiterung, die das Fundament, das mit den vorherigen Erweiterungen gelegt wurde, erfolgreich erweitert. Es bietet eine fesselnde Geschichte, frisches Gameplay, atemberaubende visuelle und akustische Erlebnisse und eine weiterhin starke Community.

The new locales are among the game's most beautiful, the music is wonderfully inspired, and I thoroughly enjoyed our journey through Tural as we guided Wuk Lamat in her ambition to become the next Dawnservant of Tuliyollal. Much of the side content was also delightful\u2014I'm particularly fond of the crafting questlines, which are all kinds of heartwarming and insightful in regards to the people and cultures of Tural.\n\nThe second half of the story, while not without its faults, was also very charming and thought provoking. More than anything, I merely found myself wishing we had a little more time with these characters. Solution Nine is by far my favorite endgame hub to date as well, both due to the story surrounding it and the aesthetics.\n\nLooking forward to further patches for the FFXI-inspired Alliance Raids and Arcadion!\n\nPS: If you're leaving, can Wicked Thunder have your soul?

Stakes in Dawntrail are relatively lower at first and is inundated with fetch and \"go talk to\"-quests, as JRPGs and story-driven content is wont to do. However, the core facets of the game remain strong. \n\nFor new players you will be received by a predominately welcoming in-game community with a very helpful player-base. Story-wise, if you're new, you'll start with A Realm Reborn, which is heavily story driven and can drag on as it is dedicated to introducing the player to the personalities within the story and developing a world in which the story takes place. These are characters that have now been a part of the story and a lot of avid fans of FFXIV for up to 14 years now as the original release for the 1.0 version of the game was 2010. \n\nCasually, you can expect to progress through that story in about a month, but more hardcore gamers can complete it in 2 weeks with a multitude of YouTube videos available online to supplement any missed details. From there, there are a multitude of robust expansions that bolster the story line and the capabilities of your characters.\n\nFor those who have left FFXIV in past expansions and were thinking about returning with Dawntrail (as I did), you can expect there to be more of what you've already experienced with continuous updates and patches being released to the progress Post-MSQ storyline. The most recent Savage Tier is fun and relatively challenging (it's appropriate to it being the first tier) with the new Alliance Raid crossing over with Final Fantasy XI. \n\nNew jobs were released with Viper and Pictomancer - both of which have a smooth game play flow, and currently very often the dominant DPS in raids (Reaper is still very relevant, as is Monk). Overall the game is still great, the Dawntrail expansion story line is immersive and fun, but keep in mind the world-building that is slated to take place as the story is having to develop a new overarching antagonist for the coming years.", "timestamp_created": 1725225942, "timestamp_updated": 1725225942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "174019793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996981901", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "n\u00e3o \u00e9 a melhor expans\u00e3o, mas \u00e9 minha favorita.

I LOVED Dawntrail, not because i was forced to babysit someone, I loved Dawntrail because of the cultures, the differences in life styles, the explanations as to each one of their histories and how beautiful this unknown region is to the player, and to this character we babysit is going to rule over. \n\nI feel like this is forgotten information, between the time it took for them to complete post EW, and the time it took them to release dawntrail, but towards the end of Post EW, you sign a verbal contract with this person you are 'forced to babysit' to help them on THEIR quest to become the ruler of THEIR land. It is at this same time that pieces of the puzzle are slowly brought together to allude to the players friends are also going to this unknown land that the person who is babysitting is going to as well. I knew from that moment that this was not going to be my story, and that should be ok. Yes, it was a bit frustrating to see all the epic moments taken away by this person we are babysitting, but to say that is the soul reason why you dont enjoy the expansion, and downvote it despite liking literally every other part of the content is a bit petty.\n\nThe player character in ff14 has always had the sense of adventure and trying to do what is right. Helping someone learn the culture of their region that is absolutely terrifying for them shouldn't fall out of the player characters alignment. with that being said, we do not decide to stay with this person either, in fact she offers a place for us to stay should we be stopping by on our adventures.\n\nSo, over all, We(the player character) agreed to the arrangement (of having the spotlight off of us) in post Endwalker Content as we explore someone else's story.

The setting was likeable, the pacing wasn't bad (to me Endwalker's pacing was terrible), and the smaller stakes throughout were a nice change of pace from world or universe ending threats. I'm someone who likes being introduced to a lot of new things, though. If you prefer a lot of action then you'll be disappointed by the story (though the dungeons and trials are superb). If you wanted to see more of the scions then you won't get to see a lot of the usual cast, though Wuk Lamat does bring a different type of energy than the usual smooth, smart, cool scions.\n\nThe first two thirds of the expansion tell the story of Wuk Lamat's growth from a naive, unsure claimant to a confident and able ruler. The story introduces you to a new continent and the (fairly shallow but overall likeable) cultures in the new areas. It has some smaller conflicts that get resolved throughout and a fairly large conflict gets resolved at the two thirds mark. Yes,  you do follow Wuk Lamat as a mentor for most of the first half. You have little agency and mostly support her and mentor her through cutscenes, which can be frustrating if you like to be the main character. I didn't mind seeing her story develop, though the beginning was a little slow with just following her while she does mundane tasks (at least you get to meet the new cultures).\n\nThe last third is interesting, starting with resolving the main conflict of the first two thirds. The rest of the game wrestles with the conflict of living in the memories of the past at all costs, or letting the past go but carrying those memories forward. The ending, basically \"memory heaven\", is fairly unique and the story is enjoyable. To me it was a very strong last third, and solidly cemented this game as my second favorite expansion. \n\nCombat in this expansion, at least for the classes I play, has been a blast. Dungeons have a lot of quick thinking required and don't feel like you're going through the motions while beating up a damage sponge. The final boss was absolutely the best combat experience I had in FF14. The classes I play were fortunately adjusted in a way where they play more naturally and there's less awkward cooldown delaying or rotation correcting. \n\nOverall, I highly enjoyed it, but I am also someone who loves fantasy cultures and politics and a good exposition dump.

I have zero interest in talking about that, however, other than to acknowledge you can dislike things without becoming exclusionary and bigoted. \n\n\n Outside of that though, I think this was a lovely expansion for the game and well sets the scene for what we can expect going forward with this next 'arc' of the MMO. It's a story that puts our characters in the backseat to allow us a trip to a new world to see things from their perspective rather than ours. It's rather elegant how they managed to pull off most of a story like this without it feeling like we are unjustly involving ourselves in matters. And what a place itself it was to explore! Tural and it's people are a delight and it inspires me further to write narratively about the universe.\n\n Characters are great too. Wuk Lamat as our protagonist is an immediate standout for all the bubbly warmth she brings to the party, but there's hardly any character that feels awful. Sphene perhaps is a bit akward but that more has to do with pacing.\n\n On that note: the pacing is my only real significant issue. I think the first bulk of the expansion with the trials to become dawnservant were all reasonably and well paced. But as we dip into spoiler zones it becomes a bit... crammed in. I certainly liked a lot of the elements present, but it just felt very tacked on to the expansion. I think it would have worked better if it was explored in patch quests more and we placed a bigger focus of Zoraal ja.\n\n There are a few other little things to nitpick, like that I feel like some of the voice direction was poorly guided in certain scenes-- I liked Wuk Lamat and Erenville for most scenes but yeah there is a few where it comes off as poorly managed rather than actual failings of the actors.

There are plenty of valid criticisms to make about Dawntrail but the discourse around this expansion is so toxic, it puts me in mind of the way people talk about Star Wars.\n\nThere are a few key points of contention that make this story so divisive in my opinion (mild spoilers):\n\n1. You & the Scions are not the MCs, we play mentor roles instead.\n- This is a very subjective topic, but for me I am unbothered that we are off to the side. Dawntrail is the beginning of a new story arc for FF14. Having just finished the last decade-long story arc, it makes sense for us to play the part as mentors to the new characters after all we've been through.\n\n2. Wuk Lamat is the real MC.\n- It would be reasonable to say that Wuk Lamat has the absolute most dialogue in the story. Personally, I loved her character arc: it is a typical hero's journey about growing from a relatively weak and ineffectual character to someone worthy of being the MC. I think her arc ends too soon though, and I can see how if you bounced off her character, you would be very unhappy about the amount of screen time she occupies.\n\n3. Tonally, Dawntrail swings between highs and lows a lot (and the lows are pretty low).\n- I would honestly argue that this is the case with every single FF story. Every Final Fantasy has really high emotional peaks in-between long periods of really low energy messing around. Whether or not you are a fan of this style of storytelling is up to you, but I think it is unfair to attribute this to being exclusively an issue with Dawntrail. Even in Endwalker, I can remember long periods of wandering around doing menial tasks despite the universe-ending stakes of that expansion. Dawntrail doesn't even come close to feeling as bad as the low points of Stormblood or A Realm Reborn.\n\nThere are plenty of other criticisms about the story, but they have been talked about to death. These criticisms are also so toxic and vitriolic I don't find them worthy of acknowledging.\n\nAside from the story, the actual content of Dawntrail is amazing. Square Enix knocked it out of the park for me with the music, zones, dungeons, and trials. Some of this content is in contention to be the best in the game for me; the battle content in particular I think is the best in the game without a doubt. The dungeons and trials really push the limits of what players can achieve within the bounds of \"normal\" difficulty, without feeling painful. The graphics update can really be felt in the zones, dungeons, and trials: they are all filled with a level of visual complexity that wasn't possible in previous expansions on top of being carried by CS3's now top-class art direction. My only gripe with the content is that quest design feels really old still: I can only tolerate being told by NPCs to talk to other NPCs so many times.\n\nDawntrail is excellent on the content alone and an easy recommend if you're already invested in FF14. The story isn't perfect, but I found myself really enjoying it when it was hitting its high points, especially in the final zones. There is also a lot of room for the story to improve, as it's pretty clear that it isn't over. FF14 has a history of delivering exceptional epilogues to even its most poorly received stories. I think the haters have genuinely forgotten how bad it used to be during the Stormblood/ARR days or aren't aware of how good we have it compared to other MMOs.", "timestamp_created": 1724489530, "timestamp_updated": 1724489887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464303761720657349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173190130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103702006", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 306973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8089, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "outside of wuk lamat's insanely weak voice acting and the story being weak as fuck i can recommend this (but for the love of god switch to the JP voices and make this 10x more enjoyable for yourself)\nthe story itself is pretty fucking bad and if i hadnt preordered the deluxe edition i wouldve skipped it (if i knew what i had waiting for me)", "timestamp_created": 1724488829, "timestamp_updated": 1724488829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499374985694885254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173176055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004435795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the story and the new stuff they added. the writing was find a bit of a slow burner but all in all likable characters.

The problem is the pacing of the story, Wuk Lamet can get annoying at times, and frankly some of the questlines are just poorly written/ended.\n\nPacing of the story: The first half is a SLOG to get through. Don't get me wrong. It does have its interesting times. But you're tasks with running around learning about cultures while you have a cartoon villain try and cause you problems at every turn. And to be honest the villain is the best part. It's comical how little effect he has on anything. \nThe second half comes in and gets very interesting very quickly which was a great change of pace.\n\nWuk Lamet: I won't say a ton since I'm sure other reviews will say way more than I will. But this character is, frankly, very poorly written and gets annoying very quickly. And a lot of the things she says just feel cringy. It hurts to hear sometimes.\n\nQuestlines: A lot of quests in this just make no sense. They have plot holes to them. Lots of them. People not knowing things when they should (The float you repair is a prime example) and (minor spoilers) there is a large scale attack from a stronger force that happens at one point. Lots of casualties. Later on an attack happens again but it's like it was nothing.\nConsidering the technology scale of the outside force realities to Tuly... it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nOne other issue I had with this expansion. Proper ambiance and scale of the country.

Coming hot off the heels of both Shadowbringers and Endwalker this expansion is meant to serve as a bit of a \"break\" coming off the almost 10 year-long Hydaelyn Saga.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nDO NOT go into this expansion expecting writing on the level of those last 2 expansions, or you'll be sorely disappointed. The story itself is fine, the initial idea of the succession contest is a fun way to have someone else in the spotlight. This someone is Wuk Lamat, someone who's been met with some...very mixed reception. I don't mind her, but she's not on the level of the other secondary main characters we've received over the story. And i don't exactly blame people for disliking her since she sticks around the whole story and is typically the addressed npc during quests. Without spoiling anything the story switches to the second plot around halfway through similar to how Endwalker did it, and the second half of Dawntrail is [b]very[/b] good in my personal opinion. It's a very low-key adventure in comparison to the last few, and that's fine, not everything needed high stakes and they told us the stakes weren't gonna be high.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nIn terms of gameplay both of the new classes are very fun! especially pictomancer in my honest opinion. I'm too much of a filthy casual button mashing enjoyer so i can't speak on the quality of classes or their complexities as i'm fine with the dumb-downed gameplay personally. All of the trials and dungeons felt fair and the sneaking missions that appear once or twice in the main story (and probably will continue to starting since Endwalker) have been given a facelift to make them [b]FAR[/b] less annoying.\n\n[h1]Other things:[/h1]\nPersonally thought the English dub was fine but i ended up switching to the Japanese dub halfway through and stuck with that until the end, so i won't comment on how the later scenes were handled. \n\nThe new zones look incredible and are fun to explore. They really outdid themselves with the graphics update as well!\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\nI will update this review once i've gotten started on the Arcadion raids introduced in 7.01, but overall opinion is that it's a solid expansion and definitely not the worst thing in the world.

I did enjoy Dawntrail! It was a smooth launch; I did not have to sit in queues as disastrously long like Endwalker.

I think this is all a step in the right direction, and I hope that SE allows the team the creative freedom and ability to do more. \n\nThe MSQ is... contentious. I personally enjoyed it, though I do have issues with some of the writing. My biggest gripe is the fact that several characters didn't get the proper justice. [spoiler] Mainly, this is directed towards how Krile was written. A lot of this is bias because I do believe that Krile was heavily shelved in Endwalker, and this expansion had me excited for more Krile screen time and character development. I feel like its in that area where I was let down with how little we got. This does make me hope for more in the post patches, but I can't help but feel it could've been done a lot more justice in the MSQ.

As someone who had no grasp of the MMO world, how it worked or anything else, I could never have imagined that I would fall in love with a story so much. It helped me and so many others through lockdown, through anxiety and depression and brought me unforgettable memories. I cried, I laughed, I made friends through the way, cleared extremes, savages and tried my hand at ultimates and lots more. The entire MMO from ARR to DT has a lot to offer, with something to do for almost everyone if you know where to look for it. \n\nI was looking forward to the new expansion and I did not hope for anything in particular, I did not know what to expect but I did know that after Shadowbringers and Endwalker it would be a hard story to top. \n\nAs it turns out, the writers of Dawntrail did not try to top it, instead, just like in ARR they set out to create a new story. Instead of returning to the waking sands, we spoke to Wuk Lamat. After saving the world from destruction, it is our time to step back out of the limelight to let other characters develop. While there are some ways in which this maybe could have been approached better I do not believe that the story itself is bad. In fact, the second half really starts to hit hard and once you've finished the MSQ and start on the Raids, they're really truly beeeautiful and beeerilliant. \n\nI do not want to spoil anything so will just say that the end of the MSQ once again had me in tears and prompted a name change for my WOL . Something I had been considering for a while anyway and this story cemented it. I cannot wait to see where it will take us and i HOPE it will go where we are all speculating it will, to meracydia to find out what happened with a certain race who found themselves somewhere entirely different. \n\nA story happens in chapters and much like ARR and the following expansions led to a culmination of gigantic proportions which still sends goosebumps down my back, I believe that the team working on FFXIV will do a fantastic job. I recommend this game because the scenery is awesome, the fights and mechanics are exciting and the story gets so good at the end I can't wait to see more! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1724274128, "timestamp_updated": 1724274128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521695256233215332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172873239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063814909", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost 1000 hours in, this is the most fun I've had with the game", "timestamp_created": 1724263817, "timestamp_updated": 1724263817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172846241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079135624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Story isn't good, everything else is amazing.

Fights in the new raid absolutely clear the snoozer that was Pandemonium.

If you're here ONLY for the story, you'll probably rate it lower, but I actually didn't mind it. Not the best, but also not as bad as people make it out to be from my view. Not as good as Endwalker's ending though. Perhaps a bit unfair, but EW/ShB set a high bar DT would always struggle to overcome.\n\nBalance/Gameplay mostly fine. Some classes are great, some need help. It's about equal with EW here considering it builds on EW's baseline. It could get better/worse.\n\nHard to rate Dawntrail because we've still got like 2 years of content in the pipeline. \"Mixed\" is a good rating so far: The base 6.0 launch has high highs and low lows.

I mention this in part encouraging anyone who reads this review to approach Dawntrail with healthy expectations, and to (hopefully) add a bit of context to any comparisons you might've heard between it and prior expansions (Endwalker, Shadowbringers, etc). This is a new story, with no prior foundation to build off of. It's fairly lighthearted if not a bit campy at parts, low stakes, and largely independent. While none of that excuses (nor is it intended to be such) the areas in which the story falls flat, I do also believe that its position in the expansion lineup warrants good faith on our part. \n\n[h3]The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:[/h3]\n\nI have around 7,500 hours logged on steam. I've played this game pretty consistently since Heavensward, and consider myself more-or-less up to date on its story. Much as I insist upon taking this expansion in good faith as its own entity, there are still healhty comparisons to be made between it and one of FFXIV's previous installments.\n\nDawntrail is presented as a reprieve from the events of Endwalker, and goes to great lengths to dissociate from them as a whole\u2014sometimes to an extent of dissonance, feeling like it outright dismisses them. It introduces and focuses heavily on a new set of characters, who either accompany or vie against you. Familiar ones also return, often filling supporting or secondary roles. The premise and structure of its story borrow heavily from the likes of Stormblood: you're called to a far-away land to help another character along their coming-of-age journey, which unfolds in two distinct chapters or parts. \n\nUnfortunately, these similarities to Stormblood also extend to its shortcomings too. The story is overly ambitious in its scope, especially for something entirely new, and this comes at a clear cost to its pacing. It's simultaneously a slow burn and jarringly brisk, willing on one hand to take its time to lay foundations and establish characters while on the other beginning and resolving entire arcs in brief. A knock-on effect of this is that certain parts of the story feel under-utilized, worthy of far more run-time but ultimately crunched to fit. Character writing is similarly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from thoughtful and motivating to feeling neglectful, or even shallow and immature. Vocal direction for quite a lot of the cast was all over the place, full of strange or outright bad reads. \n\nDon't get me wrong: this review is a recommendation for a reason. At its strongest, the story is a joy to experience... but those moments are often between a lot of stumbling.\n\nAs a whole, I enjoyed Dawntrail's worldbuilding. The culture and identity of the new continent were a massive focus in the story, and they're presented beautifully. Each of its zones and the many peoples that live within them were fun to explore and unravel, and I couldn't help feeling  rather impressed by the level of detail on display throughout most of them. With that in mind, I also felt like the writers were more than a little gunshy around the darker, grittier aspects of Tural's history and struggles. FFXIV's willingness to delve into tragedy, evil and bitter reality were hallmarks of its previous expansions, and while all are present in this one too, the story has a habit of pulling its punches.\n\nSuffice it to say, Dawntrail isn't perfect. I really feel like its story struggled under its own weight, its inconsistencies and shortcomings routinely felt. It spends a lot of its time emphasizing upbeat notes of friendship, unity and togetherness, but seldom does it challenge any of them meaningfully, to a point of feeling almost disney-like at times. \n\nBeyond everything I've expressed thus far, though, what'll probably make or break the story for you is its main character: Wuk Lamat. She has easily three times the volume of dialogue than any other character in the story, and is involved in nearly every facet of it from start to finish. Like Lyse in Stormblood, it affords you no room for ambiguity whatsoever; either you'll love her or she'll grate on you. \n\n[h3]In other words...[/h3]\n\nI enjoyed my time with Dawntrail's MSQ, and would happily recommend it... provided you go into it with the right expectations. It's a fun-yet-flawed and ultimately rather safe experience. While I appreciate what it was trying to do, I can certainly understand why it's been divisively received. The story needed more time and more setup. Given both, it could've been a lot, lot more.\n\nAs with anything, your mileage may vary. \n\n[h2]Mechanics:[/h2]\n\nMechanically, Dawntrail is simultaneously the strongest the game has been in quite a long time and highly illustrative of the game's biggest issues. Most encounters offer a very good balance of complexity and approachability, all while maintaining the same standard of spectacle present throughout most of Endwalker. I'd rate the trials in particular as being some of the best I've seen to date, and I've played a long, long time. Jobs appear to have seen relatively decent improvements, and the devs absolutely nailed the two new ones introduced alongside the expansion. \n\nUnfortunately, Dawntrail also introduces combat mechanics that suffer greatly from server latency (though thankfully, they've thus far been contained to two encounters), becoming frustratingly inconsistent at even moderate ping levels. I still feel that jobs retain a prevalent degree of homogeneity, differing in their rotation and throughput moreso than what any one job offers to a group. Your role is your niche, rather than the job you main.\n\nLikewise, your experience through content will change dramatically based on the role you choose to main. Tanks (which I say as a tank main) are largely independent in just about any form of group content with proper use of cooldowns, capable of outright soloing the majority of dungeon bosses and even trials past their respective checkpoints.\n\n[h2]Technical stuff:[/h2] \n\nGraphics, music, spectacle... everything offered in Dawntrail is perhaps the best Final Fantasy has ever seen, and certainly a strong contender even among other MMOs. I could go on and on about how much I love the art direction. Each of its zones are beautiful and distinct. The OST carries on with Endwalker's habit of using regional themes to create interesting and very memorable tracks, admittedly with a few exceptions. As mentioned above, combat looks and feels good. It's a fantastic show of progression, and I sincerely hope they keep it up going into Dawntrail's post MSQ patches. \n\n[h2]Controversies:[/h2]\n\nProbably getting jestered for this. Oh well. Mock me with free steam points for having an opinion! \\o/\n\nYou may or may not have seen word floating around about controversies involving Wuk Lamat's english voice actress. She's been incredibly vocal on social media about using her position as the voice of the expansion's lead character as a platform to push real-world politics. Sooner or later, something she's said (or the community reaction to the things she's said) will no doubt cross your ear.\n\nMy advice is to make up your own mind on where you stand regarding such things, to separate the work from the person, and to take everything you hear with a pinch of salt. Sena's thoughts and opinions are her own, not Square's. Enjoy the game for what it is, offer feedback if you feel so inclined, and let Square deal with the rest.\n\n[h3]In conclusion...[/h3]\n\nDawntrail is worth picking up. Whether or not you enjoy it as much as I did/do, it's a great show of potential for the future of the game.

It came out after Shadowbringers and Endwalker that were fantastic so we got used to really great things and end up being disappointed with Dawntrail which is an okay expansion. Not great but not bad either. It's in the good territory.\nThe main quest is fine. Wuk Lamat is the main character of Dawntrail and obviously you'll see her a lot. I like her, I think she is kind of cute and had some cool moments in the MSQ.\n\nProblem is, Wuk Lamat is always there, everytime. Everywhere you go, there she is. When she is not there, the plot is about her. She is overshadowing almost to the extreme every other characters. Everything in Dawntrail's MSQ has Wuk Lamat. You spend 90% of the MSQ speaking with Wuk Lamat.\nKrile also got the short end of the stick. Even when it was about her and her past, Wuk Lamat had to be there and intervene. Dang, when it was her time to shine and do something, she failed and she got replaced by a blue baby. In the final zone, Krile got her fifteen minutes of fame and then goes back in the shadow being no more than some NPC that follows you like a minion.\nSame for Erenville. We start to explore a new zone with Erenville and then have to look for something related to Wuk Lamat. In the final zone, Erenville gets some emotional moments but not too much because Wuk Lamat is there and had to say something, be it relevant or not. It felt like the meme with the guy with a vein popping from his forehead whenever Wuk Lamat doesn't talk for 10 seconds.\n\nThe main antagonists were okay. One is like lizard Zenos but with daddy issues and the other is really nice and cute but made the wrong choices. \nThe final boss fight was great! Until somehow Wuk Lamat manages to come in to motivate the WoL and ends the fight for us. I sighed really hard when I saw Wuk Lamat bargeing in MY fight against the last boss.\n\nThe Main Story Quest is good if you like Wuk Lamat but if you don't like her, yeah, it's gonna be tough.\n\nCombat contents are a step-up from previous expansions. Cool new mechanics and a lot of fun. If you are a story skipper and only enjoy the game for its combat mechanics, you will have a great time in Danwtrail. \nGraphic update is fantastic. My WoL is even more beautiful than before.\n\nSide contents are great too. Many side quests have great lore and some even made me tear up in the final zone. Job quests are mixed. Some are really good, others are boring. \nThe new raids are fantastic and fun and I have high hopes for the alliance raids.\n\nAnd also. Don't play with the english dub. I'm a weeb so I played the whole game with Japanese Audio but I saw some videos with the english dub in Dawntrail and wooooow the english dub is not good. The english voice actor for Wuk Lamat has no energy, no emotions. They either sound robotic or amateur. The memes about Wuk Lamat screaming in lower case are very true.\nFrench dub and german dub seem to be good or great though.\n\nAnyway, I still recommend it because all in all, I did enjoy Dawntrail.

If the patch content isn't up to Stormblood level, I think this will slip beneath SB in my ranking.\n\nAs good as the mechanics, classes, and some of the post-MSQ content they've introduced is. The story quality takes off a couple of points and so drops my review to Not Recommended.\n\nNew review: 5/10\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaven't found the sixth new zone and the last stretch of the story yet (I've basically just started the level 99 quests), so my review is subject to change, but I've done most of the story and think I've seen enough to review it.\n\nI wish Steam had a middling option rather than just thumbs up or down, because that's firmly where I lay...but your opinion on Dawntrail will hinge--as the other reviews have said--entirely on whether or not you like Wuk Lamat.\n\nShe is this expansion's main character--everything that happens in the story is centered around her, while everyone else is just kinda there in the background. I quite liked her, and she made for some good comedic and heartfelt moments, but I also can very much understand why people *wouldn't* like her. In many ways, she feels like discount Hildebrand, so if you like Hildebrand, you will probably like Wuk Lamat's comedic parts and some of the slapstick involving her.\n\nThe biggest issue, I think, comes down to the tone of the story and the insistence on including her *in every single step of every single quest, even when she has no reason to be included*. The tone is all over the place here, where serious moments (especially in the last third of the expansion) often give way to weird bits of MCU-style comedy that seem out of place before going back to extreme seriousness. I expected this expansion to be a step down from Shadowbringers/Endwalker in quality and it was exactly as I expected. This was supposed to be a lighter-toned story after the seriousness that was ShB/EW's (and *especially* EW's) existential dread, but while the first half was a somewhat-lighthearted romp with some genuinely good moments (the section involving...let's say your culinary skills...is one of my favorite questlines in FFXIV period, it was very smart writing), the second half gets extremely serious after the terrible \"Western\" section (which I will talk about below) and dives right into EW-tier existentialism which was...jarring...to say the least. But unlike with EW, the expansion is almost too afraid to commit fully to the existentialism, and keeps pulling back with whiplash-inducing intensity when it feels like it's getting too dark.\n\nDawntrail feels very much on par with Stormblood (if Ala Mhigo arc was inspired by HW and Doma arc was inspired by EW), in the fact that you have little bits of good mixed with some bad, and that seems to be a general weakness of the writing team with character-centric storylines. It's a tale of two stories of average quality, which is rough since at least SB had the excellent Doma arc to balance out the terrible (and thankfully much smaller) Ala Mhigo arc. Wuk Lamat is very much DT's Lyse, when the writer is trying to tell us she's Hien...so take that as you will.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it personally, but I think the criticism and \"mixed\" reception is warranted. It's not *as* bad as ARR (or even Stormblood, but not by much), but it's a definite step down in quality from ShB/EW, and though beginning an entirely new arc after Endwalker was *always* gonna be a lower point for the game, and I can see them laying the seeds for the new arc, I do think they could have benefited from tightening up the questline and cutting out some of the padding. The fourth zone in the game and its associated quests (I think it was the late 95-96 level range: the \"Western\" part of the story) is *very* bad, some of the worst story content in all of FFXIV, and I feel that the zone was included purely because they needed to have exactly six new areas and they only had five plotted out.\n\ntl;dr: Dawntrail is a mixed bag, with some very high highs and some extremely low lows, and your mileage will vary depending on whether you like the protagonist of this character-centric expansion. Final score: 6.5/10\n\nAnd, just for general context, my rankings for all expacs, best to worst, are as follows:\n1) Endwalker\n2) Shadowbringers\n3) Heavensward\n4) Dawntrail/Stormblood\n5) A Realm Reborn", "timestamp_created": 1723434595, "timestamp_updated": 1728430469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171928663", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086488092", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Dawntrail is a mixed experience indeed.

The normal raids in particular were a LOT of fun to go through. (I haven't done extreme/savage thus far.)\n\n...\nSo about the story.\nI'll be honest, I'm part of the group that actually really liked it. Heck, from what I gather, I'm one of the few who actually preferred the first half of the story over the second. It was a really nice time just getting to get acquainted with the local areas and the people that inhabit them. It became pretty clear to me very early on in this half that this was Wuk Lamat's story first and foremost. And because of that, I didn't particularly mind the amount of screentime she got. Different strokes for different folks, but it worked for me. I thought she was really entertaining and seeing her views on her ideals change over the course of that first half was a really nice story. I very much appreciated the comparatively lower stakes and chiller tone. (Also Bakool Ja Ja is hilarious. Shoutouts to Dick Dastardly.)\n\nAs for the second half, I still like her character, but I do wish that two certain other characters got greater focus starting from the fourth area onwards. In this regard, it started pretty okay. But the story started focusing back on Wuk Lamat quite quickly. Given how central Wuk Lamat's character and relations to the central themes of the story and the antagonistic faction are, I can definitely understand the choice. But regardless I do feel like her role [b]as protagonist[/b] should have ended with the first half, and I sympathise with the people who felt her character was overbearing, even if I don't necessarily agree.\n\nIn a lot of areas, the story felt like a different take on some core aspects of Stormblood. What with a character besides the Warrior of Light taking up the role of protagonist and the main story being split into essentially two halves covering different areas. And as someone who considers Stormblood to be the weakest [b]expansion[/b] story-wise, I felt like it worked out! Your mileage is definitely going to vary, but as for me, I haven't had as much pure fun with an MSQ's story since 4.1. There's a clear foundation being laid here and I think it will pay off. It's far from a perfect story, and definitely not even close to Shadowbringers or Endwalker in terms of emotional investment and excitement, but regardless I had a lot of fun with it!", "timestamp_created": 1723402066, "timestamp_updated": 1723402066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171893654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043452075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Fenomenal :)", "timestamp_created": 1723380271, "timestamp_updated": 1723380271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171893461", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982002013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This is OVERALL a good expansion, it's just brought down by a weaker MSQ (main story) relative to what came before.\nJust about everything else in the package is top-notch S-tier.

It was tough, and it feels like the difficulty just keeps ramping up. I remember when we all struggled with dodging AOE pools and those obscure mechanics like the Chimera in Cutter\u2019s Cry. These things are child\u2019s play for veterans now that the game has evolved into something much more action-oriented. Jobs like Black Mage suffer most since the pace is so wild that they can\u2019t sit still long enough to get off their best attacks. Bards, Machinists, Dancers, and melee classes shine at this pace, with every skill being hair-trigger and instant. But casters like Black Mage, Red Mage, and Pictomancer really suffer with their long cast times. Healers manage well since, while we\u2019re casters too, we don\u2019t have rotations to worry about.\n\nOver the years, the game has gotten faster and much more challenging. For those who love escalating difficulty, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy in Final Fantasy 14. For those who are extremely picky about the story, they might find Dawntrail disappointing, but staying positive is crucial. A roller coaster has ups and downs on purpose\u2014if it was all up, there\u2019d be no moments of relief. Almost everything else, aside from the story, is above reproach, except for some of the wilder grind fests the devs created to keep us subbing and working.\n\nWhat we all need to do is be patient and keep an open mind about the future.

The storytelling has always been the main hook for me in 14 and this expansion falls well short of the game's own bar in that regard. The MSQ has an intriguing premise and some great moments peppered throughout, but these elements are wrapped in a tortilla of pacing issues and plot contrivances that bog down any real attempt at storytelling. And, to top it all off, the character writing is just odd. Characters that we've grown to love over the previous decade are hollow facsimiles of themselves, all of their charm stripped away in favor of surface level name recognition. And the new characters are a VERY mixed bag. There are some highlights, but the main new cast just falls flat for me. I don't even hate Wuk Lumat, I'm just disappointed in her portrayal. She could have been a fantastic addition to the main cast, but instead she winds up a shallow, one-dimensional cardboard cutout that takes center stage in every major plot moment. \n\nI'm at a loss when trying to recommend this expansion. I will absolutely continue playing the game as the endgame content has me hooked, but I am wary of the direction the writing staff is taking things.

I'm a Lyse defender, to put it in perspective.\n\nI have other gripes but overall I have to commend Square Enix for a good job. The launch was stable. The graphics update is great. The new jobs are cool and show the designers still have chops they desperately NEED to flex in 8.0(?) for a holistic class overhaul. Dungeons aren't complete snoozefests and the high-end content so far hasn't leaned on puzzly mechanics like Endwalker's did.\n\nCS3 has banked a lot of goodwill by making the only good FF games in the last 20ish years and being largely responsible for the brand and company still existing, lol.

"language": "english", "review": "Purely recommending (I really wish Steam had a \"mixed\" rating) because the raids, battles and everything else connected is amazing, dungeons feel engaging, raids are fun, areas look great and fun to go through and from a play perspective, by and large this expansion delivers some really nice updates, where this is content you will get to play again and again, so it still feels worth\n\n-----------------\nHOWEVER.......\n-----------------\n\nThe story is beyond dreadful, awful pacing (10 fetch and  [spoiler] talk to Wuk Lamat... boy does that happen wayyy too often than it should [/spoiler] quests followed by a mad rush of stuff all at once, then repeat), expac massively dominated by a single character who is not written well and does not develop properly despite what the quests and story tell you, npc's who magically arrive and solve every situation and laud how great this side character is, who seems to be strong beyond belief even though they were asking you for mentorship 5 minutes ago (and no, you do not get to mentor properly, you get to watch on as things happen in the background or you are made to just sit there and wait while others get involved), previous characters not involved, having events happen in the background or not shown properly [spoiler] poor Erenville and Krile [/spoiler] or turned into empty husks that simply nod along yet again as to how amazing the side character is, even in one section where you think you get some breathing room, the side character comes back to \"save the day\" and epouse how there is nothing in the world but the power of friendship and happiness (completely throwing ideas of \"there will be dark and miserable moments and things will be tragic sometimes, but happiness and caring for others is how you resolve and dig yourself out of those moments to rise above it\" from the previous expac into the toilet), as if you are playing a story written for 7 year olds (almost feels like they took the Kingdom Hearts writing team and told them to turn up the happy factor by 11)\n\nSpeaking of previous expansions, [spoiler] of course we don't get a vacation like it was almost touted as, and yet again the story has a world ending disaster, despite Yoshi-P saying they don't want to lean on that constantly, and the silly power of friendship theme means you have to deal with nonsense from Wuk Lamat saying \"oh this person can get better, I'll try\" with Sphene (and that horrendously directed voiced line from the poor VA who clearly should have been told to get much more energy into the delivery and give it another go, but VA direction is clearly in a poor state overall anyways for this expac) despite the fact said person wants to kill everyone for their designs, it would be like trying to throw a positive spin on Thordan in a crucial moment) and it all culminates with our character finally getting their battle and showing exactly why they were brought along and delivering a key battle to save....oh no wait, Wuk of course arrives with the power of friendship unasked and while you've toiled all battle, she somehow has skills beyond you and is positioned as if she is saving you like Hydaelyn, completely ruining it, and really highlighting how badly written Wuk's character is [/spoiler]\n\nNo one is saying we can't have an expac / story where we aren't the central focus and its more so about helping someone and mentoring them, but this is so poorly written that this other character feels like they never actually develop, and are shoved in every second to further the annoyance.\n\nThe rest of the quests have you either tailgating people for the 10th time, fetching something at a slow pace, or suddenly rushing to do 12 things, so even without that character, clearly something didn't go right, and at the end of it all, the story almost feels like it should end with a quote like \"there was supposed to be this really key character in this story and a main theme that really includes them, what was the character called....the fighter of glow? No, that doesn't seem right....\" to highlight just how much this expac forgets that your character exists and has been really key for 5 expansions running.\n\nTo summarise, buy for the repeating content and the battles, the fighting and the new environment and graphics update, and try and pretend the story doesn't exist.", "timestamp_created": 1722710138, "timestamp_updated": 1722710268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51460343599319458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171370163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005507769", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed the story.

M\u00eame si Wuk Lamat occupe une place pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante dans l'extension, la deuxi\u00e8me partie est, selon moi, excellente et fait avancer l'intrigue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du lore de FFXIV tout en ouvrant de nouvelles perspectives prometteuses, potentiellement aussi captivantes que Shadowbringers. Cette extension marque le d\u00e9but d'un nouvel arc narratif, il est donc normal qu'elle commence \"doucement\". N'oublions pas que Shadowbringers et Endwalker \u00e9taient aussi r\u00e9ussis gr\u00e2ce au contexte qui les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dait.\n\nJe comprends la \"haine\" autour du personnage de Wuk Lamat, m\u00eame si je la trouve exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Je ne pense pas que cela g\u00e2che r\u00e9ellement l'histoire que les sc\u00e9naristes ont voulu nous raconter. Que l'on aime ou non, cela reste subjectif.\n\nPassons maintenant aux points FORTS de Dawntrail, qui pour moi incluent TOUT LE RESTE. Les zones sont magnifiques et agr\u00e9ables, les qu\u00eates de classes sont sympathiques (m\u00eame si elles n'atteindront jamais le niveau de Shadowbringers dans leur contexte), et les musiques sont incroyables. Sinc\u00e8rement, je trouve que Soken et son \u00e9quipe se sont surpass\u00e9s. Les donjons et les d\u00e9fis sont tr\u00e8s bons avec une difficult\u00e9 et des m\u00e9caniques int\u00e9ressantes, et les RAIDS DE L'ARCADION sont EXCELLENTS.\n\nEn conclusion, malgr\u00e9 une histoire qui peut en rebuter certains, tout le reste de l'extension est superbement travaill\u00e9, apportant un certain vent de fra\u00eecheur. Si vous aimez FFXIV, vous appr\u00e9cierez globalement Dawntrail et les futures mises \u00e0 jour.

As for my favorite character? The MC's adopted father I liked the most. \n\nDungeons? Great with challenge I liked.\nGraphics: Visuals was great.\nStorybuilding: I liked learning about the different groups of people.\n\nThe strongest part of this expansion is after you finish the questline and get to the raids.

I tend to skip cutscenes in general, however, I have had some thoughts on the story itself that may help others understand why it is structured the way it is.\n\nLooking back on it, I think it was the right decision to not have the WoL solve every problem and instead have Wuk Lamat solve them. The whole point of the story is to decide on a new successor for Tuliyollal, and the WoL obviously can't be that, far too busy saving the world and exploring or whatever. But, even if that weren't the case, it would be bad taste to have a foreigner from across the sea come and magically solve all your issues through their own might... Like thats obviously incredibly imperialist messaging for a story that seems to be trying to get an anti-imperialist message across, [spoiler]such as with the whole deal with the Alexandrains[/spoiler].\n\nI think the main thing the sours the story for people is how much of it is conveyed through cutscenes. Many people would probably feel like the WoL isn't sitting back on the sidelines if they, as players, weren't also sitting back on the sidelines watching cutscene after cutscene play out. Had more of the story been told outside of cutscenes, I don't think people would have such sour opinions. \n\nTake, for instance, a part near the beginning where you are reading the stone pillars to learn a bit about Tuliyollal's history. It could have been handled with interaction points in the world itself, so you would have to physically walk to each one and examine them, which, at the very least, would give the player something to do between examining them, and keep them just the tiniest bit more engaged. Many other cutscenes could have been, and still could be, converted into something similar to this to keep players engaged with the world, instead of just sitting back and doing nothing, but I digress.\n\nAs for job changes, I've never really been one to mind how \"complex\" or \"high skill ceiling\" a job is since I level them all and just play the ones I personally feel like playing at the time. I believe most of the challenge of the game comes from the encounters rather than the jobs themselves, so making the jobs simpler and the encounters harder seems like a step in the right direction for me. They just need to work on keeping them flexible (e.g. make flare star NOT drop when you switch to ice).\n\nIn short, the WoL had to be sidelined for the majority of the story in order to keep them from becoming a foreign savior type who shows up and solves all their nations issues. This would be less of an issue if the player weren't also sidelined via excessive amounts of cutscenes. However, combat and especially encounter design seems to be improving for the most part and I look forward to leveling all the jobs to 100 and doing the new encounters.", "timestamp_created": 1722382460, "timestamp_updated": 1722382559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543320417404174805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171124861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358784028", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "very good content\nbut very mid story\nlet's hope 7.X story is better", "timestamp_created": 1722376824, "timestamp_updated": 1722376824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171094817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112216187", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "IN this expansion you are giving the main character role to a shonen protaganist lion woman.

I took my time, I walked, I talked, I let myself be fully enveloped in the world, the contest, and while the story was a little generic anime \"with my friends, we can accomplish anything!\" That isn't exactly new for the series.\n\nAnd in my letting myself just kinda go along for the ride, I found myself getting more invested than I probably should have. I've been going through one piece lately, so I've learned to just roll with a lot of stupid silly things and accept it and move on, and that might have helped here in way. I was crying in the last zone very heavily over characters I didn't even get to know very well. Even more so when it was around characters I actually did know. It was a nice neat little story. Nothing amazing and mindblowing, but enjoyable. I still recommend it because overall, it's a worthwhile use of time. If you can just roll with the punches and try to have a good time, you'll enjoy it.

The new jobs are unique and a lot of fun, and the combat instances have mechanics that kept me on my toes, sometimes even in the monster packs between bosses. Only one dungeon was boring to me, but since it was the lv 99 dungeon at least I won't see it in roulettes very often. \n\nThe raid series continues to deliver with great combat content and an interesting story with a bombastic WWE-style framing.

Unfortunately the main story quests are the absolute weakest part with it being maybe a 4/10 ON ITS OWN. Everything else about the expansion is new and fresh. The new zones, dungeons, trials and extremes are all exciting and have new somewhat experimental mechanics that are fun to learn. The normal raids are where it shines the most. If you're a fan of WWE or anime tournament arcs, then it's worth going through the fetch quest visual novel that is the MSQ. \n\nThe main story (as much as I enjoyed it in the moment) is a ride through a lot of low risk story beats that feel like beast tribe quests. Our characters take on a mentor role, which I like. We're the Kakashi to Wuk Lamat's Naruto, but my god is it hard to actually sit through her loud and cringey \"i'm gonna be hokage\" declarations. I don't mind her being the main character, but the story focused too much on telling us that she's like Naruto/Midoriya and too little on showing us that we're a badass powerful mentor like Kakashi/Aizawa. \n\nThe solo story instances don't involve very much gameplay, and in less unique ways than in previous expansions. We stalk a lot more people, fight waves of people, or stalk people while fighting people. This is normal, but compared to something like a certain solo instance in Garlemald we have less to do and it is way less emotionally impactful. I guess what i'm saying is they could have fit a lot more in terms of gameplay like playing as other characters more often even if it's just Wuk Lamat, or showcasing how strong our character is while still making it a mentor moment. \n\nWith all that said, this expansion is a 9/10 but the msq is a 4/10. It feels like there are more missed or fumbled narrative and gameplay opportunities in the Dawntrail msq than than the entire light and dark saga combined.

I went in with pretty low expectations given that this expansion was a new start for the plot, with little to build on. I was very pleasantly surprised with just how much they managed to achieve with it. Even post Endwalker, this game shows no signs of easing up on dealing with weighty philosophical themes, continuing to explore them through it's uniquely humanistic writing.\n\nAs long as you're actually willing to give it a chance, rather than write it out entirely over nitpicks, you should have a good time.

This really isn't an exaggeration, by the way.\n\nThe bulk of the complaints seem to be about the story's deuteragonist, half of the blame is placed on her dubbed lines, half of it on her writing. The former while admittedly sloppy every now and then, is very clearly just an issue of bad voice directing, but is nearly entirely pinned to the voice actress instead, likely in no small part due to certain hateful beliefs held by many of her critics, which absolutely also motivate a great deal of the hate for the character. The latter, meanwhile is either about her sheer prevalence in the story (something crucial to prevent this from just being some awkwardly outdated white savior story) or about her personality, which really shouldn't be an issue unless you're a cynical husk. \n\nPersonally, I found her quite endearing from the get go. Imagine if EW had mixed reviews because people thought the loporrits were too silly, even though loporrits being silly is such a small part of not only their time on screen, but also an even smaller part of the rest of the expansion.

Just as ARR had hiccups for having the job of starting a new long story, Dawntrail as well shows the same hiccups along the journey, and while done in a much better way than ARR, falls short of the storytelling that was previously done in shadowbringers or endwalker.\n\nStory\nThis is probably the aspect that will easily be criticized the most, even for someone like me who still enjoyed the story a ton. Dawntrail's story can be split into 2 parts, and without getting too deep into spoilers, will have your enjoyment of each side, especially the first half, solely on how much you enjoy a certain character, or to be exact, Wuk Lamat. Luckily I did enjoy her presense, but I still felt like the 1st half does having really poor pacing issues and weaker writing in general. I know people didn't like how we are not the main character of this expansion, but from what we have had to deal with for the past expansion, it was a nice change of pace. It still can't be avoided however of how much I wish that 1st half had better writing, cause it took me awhile to start getting into the expansion till like maybe lvl 92 msq. The 2nd half does get better, with a huge shift in tone, but still suffers from the same pacing issues as the 1st half, and writing that not only lacks in certain aspects, but urgency as well. There are a ton of moments that the story wants you to start panicking, only for you to stroll along like you have all the time in the world so you can \"better understand the people\". Of course some of the best moments in this expansion WAS understanding others more, but it still affected the pacing way more than how ff14 pacing usually is. Overall I still feel like Dawntrail was a good overall story, but ranking wise is nowhere near shadowbringers or endwalker, and is probably around the same level of either heavensward or stormblood for me, specifically the x.0 storylines. Still enjoyed it more than ARR and believe it to be a very good story still, but knowing that its the world building expansion, would had liked a bit more better writing now that we have experienced EW and SHB.\n\nCharacters\nSome strong ones, but overall wasn't as strong as previous expansions. The best highlight characters were Krile, Wuk Lamat (her expansion), Erenville, and the other supporting characters such as Koana and The three Ja Ja, but mainly the father and Bakool Ja Ja. Many of the Scions apart from Krile were a bit one note this expansion. We got to experience mainly Alphinaud and Alisaie as they tagged along with us the most, with the other Scions trickling down later on, but they and the rest of the scions (apart from krile again), didn't really experience a character arc this time around. While they do share screen time, Their writing in general felt more of a side treatment compared to previous expansions. They were still prominent, but weren't nearly as strong as before. Even with those complaints, they were still very good, as I really did enjoy Wuk Lamat's character growth throughout the expansion as she realizes her potential as the leader. Krile FINALLY getting the arc she deserves was a treat as well, and Erenville being the main tag along was a ton of joy to experience. Alphinaud and Alisaie still have strong moments throughout the story, albeit not the focus of this expansion. Koana's 1st half story arc was a ton of fun alongside the other contestants, especially Bakool Ja Ja. While the big main villain of this arc wasn't as strong as before, I still understood their reasoning even if I wished they were fleshed out a bit more. I still got teary over some scenes with the characters, even with ones I really didn't expect to cry over, and while the pacing was not that good this time around, still had those highlights that I love from 14's story.\n\nGameplay\nWon't go over the base gameplay, just the new additions, also haven't done the new raid series or anything apart from msq yet. I loved the dungeons and trials this expansion, ESPECIALLY the dungeons as they felt not only challenging for a base msq dungeon, but had great songs and bosses to go alongside. The trials were also a ton of fun not only storywise, but especially mechanically. I am glad they are starting to make the msq encounters more challenging and engaging compared to previous expansions, and I hope they continue along this path. The new (or more enhanced) stealth mechanic this time around was good, of course was just the same as endwalker, but with visual indicators this time. For the new job additions, I played thru with summoner, which quite honestly their new additions this expansion were fine, as they didn't add much apart from solar bahamut, which does feel unique with the AOE heal, but not new enough to change how I do my rotations at all. Thew new jobs however are SO MUCH fun, I have been loving Pictomancer so far, but plan to level up Viper as I enjoy just how fast their rotation is overall. If there is one thing this expansion did the best, it was in the gameplay department.\n\nMusic\nA much different approach to the usual songs we hear from Soken, and my god did he nail the OST for this expansion cause it is GOOOODDD. Many of the zone themes, especially towards the end were so damn good, and I just loved all the new songs that were introduced this expansion. While the ONLY complaint I have is the lack of new songs for scenes like the sad moments, or happy moments (or just a new song whenever the characters just talk about something), but still overall was fantastic as always.\n\nLast Positives/Nitpicks\n-Planning to switch from SMN, as im starting to get a bit annoyed how dead simple their rotation is.\n- Still loved Wuk Lamat, even with all the complaints\n- The difference between 1st and 2nd half were jarring, but were tied together much better than how stormblood handled it.\n\nConclusion\nOverall was a very good expansion for a x.0, especially with how it has to start the world building and a brand new arc. However it still has its faults that prevent it from being as good as it could be. I understand why others feel very mixed about this expansion, as while other departments were improved a ton, the story obviously wasn't as strong as previous expansions. I know that the previous writer has now taken a more back role, so new blood is writing the msq, but I do hope they figure out their tempo and write the patches with much more care than the base msq.

I welcome the developers actually treating us like players who have cleared 4 previous expansions worth of content. \n\nArt direction and OST is primo shit as usual, however audio mixing during MSQ cutscenes is hit or miss. Why does Y'shtola sound so much more tinny than the rest of the cast? Wuk Lamat's VA is fine, by the way. I do feel that her VA could stop holding back whenever it's time for a loud, emotional scream or yell, but besides that she delivers a good performance overall. I struggle to believe that people aren't being overly critical of Sena Bryer's performance because she's trans, considering a few right-wing grifters have posted about this game in the past month.\n\nThe MSQ is pretty good, might have a couple pitfalls, but still solid. I reiterate that the haters must once again be smoking crack when Stormblood is right there and far worse in many respects. Are you really going to tell me Wuk Lamat is a worse protagonist than [i]FUCKING LYSE[/i]??? That aside, the story is a 2-part affair, the first half being what is easily summed up as FFXIV's Shonen Anime Tournament Arc, and the 2nd half a return to some larger stakes that one will find to be more in line with previous expansions. I'm really curious to see where they take the story now in the patches to come, especially given the events of the final area in the story.\n\nOverall a very fun expac.

The update was definitely needed (though I know it's not unique to the DLC itself, but still), and the new areas you explore and the mechanics in the fights are really well done.  This definitely shows off well in the later fights, and even when I did the content on a consistent basis, I still needed to put my thinker to work to get past some of the bosses.  Also Soken and the crew who made the tunes for the expac still know what they're doing, as there's no lack of bangers in the zones and fights!\n\nThe Bad: Inconsistencies and shortcomings, trust parties (just one aspect).  With not saying anything of the story, there are some flaws in the main story that had me raise my brow a little where something is stated, only to be contradicted later on for no reason, while the class quests had things going on that our WoL would have definitely seen coming based on prior experience...just seemed kind of weird and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  Another thing (though it's more a minor gripe) is having some roles in the trusts being filled in odd and inconsistent ways.  I can understand something like in earlier content before the trust system came to be prevalent in ARR and HW, but it feels awkward seeing a certain class healing when it shouldn't.\n\nThe Inbetween: The story (parts of it), Wuk Lamat and voice acting.  The first half of the story was kind of straightforward and bland-ish, though I was kind of expecting that, with only a couple moments that kind of shocked me.  Later on though in the second half it gets wild, and I really enjoyed it compared to the first half.  And yes, there has to be something for Wuk Lamat.  I've heard things about her voice actor, but I won't open that can-o-worms and just stick to a couple other points of more importance to me.  Wuk Lamat is indeed adorable, and I overall enjoyed her throughout the story, and it was indeed focused around her.  At times later on she seemed very up front when other characters (as well as the now-former scions) should have been able to take the stage again in a more prevalent way.  And while this isn't a big ordeal throughout most of the story, at some points Wuk's voice actor could have done better or needed better direction at very hard hitting points in the story, especially near the end.\n\nThat's all for now, but this may be edited down the line with future patches.", "timestamp_created": 1721611401, "timestamp_updated": 1722247453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170442168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077401047", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Dungeons com mec\u00e2nicas novas interessantes, mapas bonitos e gostei da historia conforme foi chegando mais para o final.

 she works just fine.  you don't have to necessarily like it and that's fine, but like, it was plainly obvious barely ten quests into the expack that Wuk Lamat's character arc was about her personal growth and the more i go through it, the more i feel like people just kind of stopped paying attention because she wasn't suffering enough.\n\nfor the people who are annoyed that Wuk Lamat et al are kind of saturday morning cartoony about the story morals:\nprobably the most valid complaints here.  the expack is a bit heavyhanded, but i feel like it's fine.  it didn't have to be another masterpiece like Shadowbringers, we aren't in the peaks of the Hydaelyn & Zodiark story or anything.  it's a new story and it's okay that it's not blowing your kupo nuts clean off.  i'm an adult, i don't need all my stories to be super dark and mature and brooding.  besides, there [i]is[/i] interesting conflict here.  you look at the intercommunity conflicts inside all the different turali groups and tell me that's not good enough.\n\nfor the people who are annoyed at \"Speak with Wuk Lamat x 236529375273\":\nyou're her advisor dude. you were literally HIRED TO SPEAK WITH WUK LAMAT.  of course a lot of the expansion is going to be spent talking to her because again, the story [i]revolves around her.[/i]  you've been advancing the entire story up to this point by Speaking with H'uevar Thyfuque and the only reason it's annoying now to people is because it's the same person more often.\n\nfor the people upset at DT's story being a rehash of previous story arcs and other characters/stories:\nmedia literacy is dead.  everyone copies from eachother.  xenophobia, people doing horrible things for sympathetic goals, and [i]characters being focused on[/i] are not unique concepts to one place and time.  sorry you had to find out this way.  if you need what you experience to be completely different from anything you've seen before, go read a manual for some specialised factory machinery or something.\n\nfor the people who find the sound balancing and voice-acting bad:\nbad sound design?  literally who?  do you guys not touch your sound settings at all?  everyone sounds fine to me.  honestly the \"worst\" voice-acting i've heard so far were from the Yok Huy, and it's only because i'm fighting a sore throat and listening to people gargle gravel like chunky Listerine was making it worse.  i've always had to adjust [i]every[/i] game's sound settings, no matter how highly its sound balancing is praised.  it's not DT's fault you play your games with /bgm 100 and deafened yourself.  you're a grown ass adult, adjust your damn audio to what you need.\nalso Wuk's VA sounds perfectly fine.  i feel like you guys are more upset about the voice act[i]or[/i] than the voice act[i]ing[/i] and don't wanna just say it out loud.", "timestamp_created": 1721561859, "timestamp_updated": 1721561859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504509449005126953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170385879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259719311", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent", "timestamp_created": 1721555972, "timestamp_updated": 1721555972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477707028388977051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170383920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121730481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "story is literally fine lol.", "timestamp_created": 1721553832, "timestamp_updated": 1721553832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477863729000091553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170377334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298941100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "the MSQ's good, ya'll are just mad it ain't Endwalker again.", "timestamp_created": 1721546131, "timestamp_updated": 1721546131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495066344738006592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170374351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117230705", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Having just finished the exspansion today I have to say I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nIts the beginning of a new story, theres so much to work with going forward and the message of cultural appreciation alongside the acceptance of what is gone.

The narrative and character writing is certainly a disappointing step down from Shadowbringers and Endwalker, if not the rest of the expansions. Most of the comments do a pretty good job explaining why, even if I feel some of the reviews are worded a bit dramatically. There seemed to be major issues with voice acting direction. Even the old characters sounded really off compared to their previous appearances. Sadly, it wasn't just Wuk Lamat.\n\nIf MSQ was the only thing in this game, I would be let down.\n\nThat said, everything else, the encounter design, the zones, the music, the graphics and art direction, and the most recent raids, Arcadion. All of these are, no joke, the best I think they have ever been in this game. And that is why I am giving this a positive review. \n\nIn these respects, the developers went above and beyond. I had lost faith in their ability to create interesting normal content. Since Shadowbringers, jobs have been homogenized, and combat encounters have become boring, for lack of a better word. Though jobs are still homogenized, the devs finally seem committed to bringing some of that uniqueness back in the future, and though I had a lot of doubts, after what I've seen from Dawntrail, with combat that is WAY more engaging then anything in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, the devs have exceeded my expectations. I have become cautiously optimistic that they will deliver with the jobs as well.\n\nAnd one more thing about the writing. The Main Scenario Writer for ARR was Kazutoyo Maehiro. Though the writing was lacking there, after the experience gained and lessons learned, he would go on to write Heavensward, which is largely considered to have been a massive step up, story-wise.\n\nThe Main Scenario Writers for Stormblood were Banri Oda, and most notably, Natsuko Ishikawa. The writing there was lacking as well, but they were able to find their groove and play on their strengths, with Oda taking on the worldbuilding and lore, While Ishikawa did the Plot, Characters, and most dialogue. They were able to turn things around really quickly in post-Stormblood, giving us some of the best story content the msq has ever seen, writing Shadowbringers and Endwalker (6.0).\n\nLikewise, now the writing team has changed again. This is why I think the current story was lacking. It has been a pretty clear pattern, but if the pattern holds, we just need to let the new writers cook and keep the helpful criticism coming, even if their first big expansion was a dud. \n\nAthough the msq was disappointing, I'm feeling optimistic about the future of the game for the first time in awhile. We have the most post-patch content scheduled to come out out of all the expansions. The post-game content that has been released so far has been excellent. And the developers have finally gotten their encounter design into gear... It took them long enough.\n\nAll of this is to say, keep the helpful criticism coming, it'll help the writers and devs in the future.

The first part is a slug and boring the second one is actually really good. Overall the story is somewhere between Stormblood and Heavensward for me. It has it's moments but the negatives of the story kinda even it out to be an overall meh story. I was hoping for a Krile and Erenville focused expansion and the Write of Succession comes as a side and not-so important part of it. It wasn't sadly 'till the very end where we get barely anything with them. \n\nCharacters (only write about characters that I remember from the main MSQ):\n- Wuk Lamat is a horribly written and horribly voiced character. Her personality and world view can be changed just like Lyse to become a bearable (and sometimes likeable) character BUT they NEED to replace the English VA. You can clearly hear in multiple occasions that the English VA is actually a guy. It completely ruins the immersion. They shouldn't ditch the character just write her better + change the VA to an actual girl. Was forced to change to Japanese just because of her.\n- Coana is a character that I woudn't expected to like in the end but I was pleasantly surprised. Nice character with a potential to grow. Would love to see him in the Patch MSQ.\n- Bakool Ja Ja had an expected character turn from being a bad guy to become an ally. The reasoning was very Final Fantasy XIV like so it's nice. Another character that we may see more in the patch stories. Also he earned a meme status.\n- Krile and Erenville was is the background 'till the last zone. Barely any character development. This expansion was their chance to grow. I only hope that they will in the patch MSQs. Both of the characters deserve to be in the spotlight more (especially Krile).\n- Sphene was pretty much an ascian-wanna-be character in my eyes. She wanted to save her people no matter what (just like a certain ascian) and was programmed to be successfull no matter the cost (just like a certain ascian). She had potential to be a great villain and they didn't fully explored the possibilities.\n- Zoraal Ja was an obvious choice to make as a villain. Did his job pretty well.\n- The other Scions were there just to be there. We could've just cut them and the story wouldn't change at all. \n- Estinien was also there... for some reason. :/\n\nZones:\nEvery single zone is beautiful. But they feel empty. I really really loved Shaaloani's look and feel and it's clearly expandable.\n\nMusic:\nSoken did it again (except one Disney ass song. I am not sure who wrote it but that song was a HUGE miss). \nAs of today, we already have the Arcadion raid available and the music there is phenomenal. All of them are a hit.\n\nMisc:\n- The Dungeons, Trials and the Raids went through a huge improvement and all of them are a 10/10. Except Trial 1 (including extreme) which was a bit weaker than the others but still an excellent fight. People complain about the difficulties of the fights but those peeps are just bad players in general. Not even casuals honestly. Please don't listen to them. 90% of the players are happy with the currently fights.\n- The New Housing Items are nice.\n- The Graphics update was a nice surprise. It didn't changed much but it improved where it had to. Can't change a lot on an old engine without a complete overhaul.\n- AST went through a rework which made the job much more predictable. The \"Astral\" and \"Umbral\" draw's cooldown is still way too long. Instead of 55 seconds, 45 would be much better.\n- SCH is still my favorite healer. It didn't changed much but the changes were pretty nice. Would recommend SCH over most of the healers.\n- GNB's got some niiice improvements. Love the Lion Heart combo + the additional Continuation AoE. \n- MNK is a questionable one. The job in Endwalker was really open for multiple combos. In Dawntrail however, it gotten streamlined. Not a big fan of that, The Beast Chakra Mastery is a nice addition, the Enhanced Riddle of Wing + Riddle of Fire are a great additions. \n- Black Mage has been a letdown for me. The new ability is really weak, the removal of Paradox during the Ice Phase was a misstake. It's still a fun job but they need to increase the potency of the new ability. \n- VPR is a new job, great concept, great execution. love the positionals. If you are great with any melees, VPR is going to be a treat!\n- PCT is the other new job. I am not a fan of it at all, but I see why people like it. It needs a nerf though.\n\nOverall:\n7/10 I hope that the expansion is a 2nd Stormblood (The main MSQ was meh but everyting else is great)", "timestamp_created": 1721466806, "timestamp_updated": 1721466806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492224395275115967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170300449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092474532", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 138949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3174, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I had to think about things for a bit, as the story is akward at times.

Sadgeville and Krille got done really bad imo, and the resolution to that was painfully disapointing.

I have finished the MSQ and got a taste of most post game content, and as an avid lover of FFIV, I have some opinions. I should point out, I primarily play tanks and healers and tend to get all of them to max level, with select DPS used.\n\nPROS:\nGraphical changes, they look nice on a higher end PC.\n\nMost of the new mechanics were a refreshing take on old indicators. It made you have to look more at the boss and environment, meaning knowing your class matters more. I would argue in groups, or if you are blessed with a voice chat based raid group, healers are needed more than ever to make calls on positions and abilities, since I feel like most tanks and DPS look at their feet while playing. Another thing, is the mechanics are repetitious enough that there is no excuse in some of these that people don't identify them after the 8th instance of it occurring. This is a nice increase in difficulty in some places.\n\nHealers feel strangely diverse, mostly due to later game content requiring so much healing. I am preferring the White Mage over the other three, but truly loving the Astrologian changes, as it feels like the thought and impact from before matters with each card. I see the complaints that people have, but it genuinely feels like you have to think more about who and when to use a card than draw a card till you get a symbol. Whether you are tossing them on a tank for a buster, or on that DPS that just will not leave the AOE. Scholar is about the same as its been for a bit, and while it sometimes is a struggle to heal up on a Sage, the class always has felt more preparatory than panic-response based. When you know the fight it feels so nice on Sage.\n\nTanks feel diverse in a different way, playing or healing a warrior or paladin is so much easier than the gunbreaker or darkknight. Honestly healing the latter two in any content feels like hell at times, depending on the quality of said tank, and playing as them feels like you need to know the fight better to use your mits well.\n\nDPS is hard for me to say. I play SAM, DNC, SMN, and now VPR. Viper feels good, barring some very busy moments, to more boring moments. It has upcoming changes as of this month, and while people are making mountains out of molehills, I am hoping the changes just spread out some of the chaos to make other parts less boring. Samurai feels about the same barring some mild changes that make it just feel less exciting. Dancer is gorgeous with dance of the dawn, and otherwise the rotation feels smoother with some of the 90-100 content for it. Summoner is my only normal class I haven't leveled yet, but hoping it kept the smoothness of endwalker.\n\nThe story was interesting, and for the most part a pro. I like the main cast this time around. Wuk Lamat was fun, but clearly naive and has growth. Perhaps a bit frustrating at times in the story, or too simplistic, but for the background, it makes sense. The sibling dynamic was interesting. The roles of the characters in part one made sense and the logic about why they were doing what they were doing. Voice acting in English was about what is expected, there was no stunners but for a bunch of unguided voice actors it was manageable. There will be particular gripes in cons. The first part of the story was refreshing, learning about the new land/lore. Incorporating the ideas of food and rituals into subcultures of the greater land. The overall purpose of the story both 1st and 2nd parts were good, but we will discuss my gripes with the 2nd part in cons. The lore and logic additions to how the world works in part 2 make for potentially interesting opportunities for expansions in the future though.\n\nCONS:\n\nIn the story, let me tell you. The first part had the pace, rising action, the stakes, the mini-micro villain. The second, felt forced, or rushed. It felt like some horrible amalgamation of the pacing of stormblood and heavensward.  While the stakes were clear, and there was a clear challenge, and the scope as it was revealed was nice, it was so weird to see them just.... be so inactive or inefficient. The absolute patience the characters had, despite the stakes, was jarring. Most of the cast is battle hardened at this point and flat out know better. Two of the cast members clearly were supposed to have more ties to part 2, but it felt sprinkled into a story that you could remove both of them from, change some lines, made a couple generic NPCs that just were helpful, and overall it would not have impacted anything.\n\nVoice acting was about as good as the English voice acting could be. But its time to call out one horrendous mistake in this expansion. Its one thing to fake an accent, its another thing trying to have 10 different voice actors fake it inconsistently. If Wuk Lamat was supposed to be that present or the teams rep of the country, everyone should have listened to her voice lines and recorded theirs after to mirror the accent, or had better guidance. Whoever the main focus is, the voice acting needs to mirror the idea. Not a bunch of people trying to fake a Spanish, mid-american accent. And why do half of the characters in this supposedly recently (last 100 years) isolated country, lack an accent all together, when their parents or children they grew up with in these villages have them?\n\nCombat issues: The \"busy\" phases of a couple trials/bosses. With how aoe's work in this game, those busy phases are vile. When half my party isn't lagging but clearly doesn't have the latency I do, I see them getting smacked with damage they really wouldn't have to suffer through with a less chaotic phase. It favors people with flawless internet. \n\nThe player base. I don't know what happened to you all. Even in endwalker, there was tact, decorum, class. I have had more people rage quit or downright refuse to listen to logic or reason this expansion. I have had tanks that downright refuse to use mits. Healers get so mad at people they won't rez them. There have always been nut cases, but this has gotten downright wild. On occasion this has been an absolute struggle. It takes 5 seconds to say, \"I don't tank/heal, give me some time.\" and hopefully you can help them or guide them through the dungeon. But the tact in parties has been disgusting lately. People thinking picto field buffs people that stand in it, people still doubling up dance partners. ITS 2024 PEOPLE. Some things don't work like you want them to and you don't know how they work.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe story was alright, just weird in the second half. Flashy and challenging but even for fantasy logic and peoples actions it was a stretch at times.\n\nI do think highly of the class additions changes, and hope they just can fine tune viper a bit.\n\nI would recommend playing it, as its FFIV and its nice be with friends and just continue adventuring.", "timestamp_created": 1721411377, "timestamp_updated": 1721411377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170257849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167141917", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish south america was real", "timestamp_created": 1721410174, "timestamp_updated": 1721410174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 63, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798243880271911621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170254416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128697131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "new classes good, new dungeons and raids fun, wuk lamat and erenville are my blorbos", "timestamp_created": 1721406882, "timestamp_updated": 1721406882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170236883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048695336", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "em geral eu gostei, mas a historia com certeza poderia ser bem melhor", "timestamp_created": 1721391560, "timestamp_updated": 1721391560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170227522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225940052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Battle content is better than ever.

However, a consistent theme across both is fun and challenging new content and story themes that will reoccur later. \n\nUnfortunately, as I've seen with a lot of other reviews, many have not completed the expansion before leaving a review. You're gonna find that the first half of Dawntrail is primarily character establishment and scenes that aren't all too action-packed. Your enjoyment of the expansion will come through slowly watching characters establish themselves, learning about Tural, or speculation and theorizing. I found the latter to be most enjoyable! \n\nThere's really two things you need to know before setting in: \n1. This expansion is not about you. They did say that this is about the Warrior of Light pretty much going on vacation, so the stakes aren't going to be super high from the outset. \n2. Patience. The themeing of this expansion isn't going to be super obvious to you at first, but just like Shadowbringers and grief and Endwalker with despair, you're going to be ending this expansion with taking away something that is beautifully done.\n3. Don't be too harsh on Wuk Lamat. Some people are annoyed with her character, but she grows a GREAT amount. \n\nWith that being said, once it hits the emotional moment of 94, the expansion goes crazy. Rush it if you have to get to the good parts, but savor it, it all comes together in a very beautiful way that made my grown ass cry multiple times LOL", "timestamp_created": 1721338797, "timestamp_updated": 1721338797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490280479192733765", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170190730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096320395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't write a lot of reviews, but since Dawntrail has had very mixed reviews I figured I would write one -- as a WoW veteran who has been playing FFXIV since Shadowbringers. Most of my playtime is real (3,000ish hours as of writing this), I do not AFK overnight in Limsa haha.\n\nFirst things first, I want to get the combat out of the way, because it's the main positive thing I have to say about Dawntrail. I've been a relatively casual player, doing new main patch content on release (MSQ, new dungeons & raids) since I caught up. I used to be a Heroic and occasionally Mythic raider back in my WoW days, but I didn't have the time to take WoW seriously in college so I decided to take a more casual approach to FFXIV, a well-deserved break after spamming Mythic+ instead of doing my homework lol. With that said, Dawntrail's combat has been a great middle ground for me! Others may disagree, but I think Dawntrail's combat so far has been engaging enough to pay attention to avoid dying but also not turn off your brain sort of fights yknow? I've been playing the game long enough to know what most mechanics do just by looking at the boss or the cast-bar, but Dawntrail added more unique mechanics into the mix to spice it up and not be the same type of mechanics that I knew too well. I don't want to go on and on, but the combat is the reason why I ended up upvoting and not downvoting. It took some thought, in all honesty, but I think this expansion is worth it for the fights alone. Especially the raid that just came out!\n\nNow, for the story. I will not go into spoilers, just in case anyone reading this wants to attempt to experience any of the previous expansions or this one. One major thing I need to address is that FFXIV usually puts story first, this is a story game at the end of the day and the cool raids are just an extra plus. There is no skip for new expansions, if you skip you are forced to play through the current installment. Just so we're clear, I LOVE the story. I was never a skipper, I read every MSQ up until Dawntrail's release. I do usually skip blue quests but some of them I pay attention to.\nDawntrail's main story is basically split into two parts. The first half is about Wuk Lamat's journey to becoming Dawnservant, and the second half is something completely different (to avoid spoiling), like it doesn't even belong in Dawntrail. What's funny though, is that I enjoyed the second half more than the first half. As I said, I skip blue quests, especially tribal quests, because they do not interest me. The first half of Dawntrail felt like a really long tribal questline, something that's usually side content that deep lore enjoyers probably love but most players do not care. That was my issue with Dawntrail, personally, each area felt like a history lesson that you'd get out of side quests shoved into MSQ. Dawntrail is the first expansion in which I have skipped cutscenes within MSQ, and a lot of them... I skimmed through seemingly important dialogue, but a majority of unvoiced cutscenes were skipped. I thank the \"several cutscenes will play in sequence\" warning for making me pay attention when an important event is coming up lol. \n\nImportant note: For those who would call me a skipper and complain that I cannot speak for people who actually read everything, I watched my friend play through the entire Dawntrail MSQ without skipping. I didn't miss anything, haha.\n\nOkay, now for the second half. This is where it got interesting for me. I loved most of the second half, until the final zone. It's hard to speak of the final zone without spoiling, so all I will say is: it was drawn out a LOT. The zone itself was beautiful, WAS (you will know why when you get there), but I heard you can NewGame+ to bring it back so that's fine. As for the story, we're there on urgent matters but the characters pretend we're not and we spent hours exploring instead of stopping the big bad asap. I'm pretty sure I spent almost a whole day in the final zone, and I skipped some dialogue because I wanted to be done. Dawntrail really just makes you want to skip even if you're not a skipper, I'm sorry.\n\nThe second trial also felt more like a final fight than the third trial (the last one). The second trial is probably my favorite fight in the game, from the music to the mechanics to the boss design. TLDR they were cooking with the second half of Dawntrail and then they had to make it go on and on for more XP or whatever and it made me madge. I would downvote if the fights weren't so fun.", "timestamp_created": 1721334763, "timestamp_updated": 1721334909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170182666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115805292", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 249342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 283, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Alisaie literally looks directly in the camera and says \"This is Wuk Lamat's story.\" and people are upset that the protagonist is being a protagonist\n\nthe lack of media literacy is almost as noticeable as the BO", "timestamp_created": 1721326562, "timestamp_updated": 1721326562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486586719751358032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170181776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181066145", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 219285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7878, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Final fantasy 14 has always been a sort of thing I return to when im in a really hard stage of my life. It has helped me through some really tough times and for that I am really thankful. I originally stopped playing it after Endwalker as some things happened in the game that made it impossible for me to not get a bad feeling playing it, I always was afraid that that was it, my escape from reality and favorite piece of fiction being unenjoyable for me, but Dawntrail has somehow revived the love I felt for the game twofold.\n\nA lot of people really dislike the story and honestly I cant quite see why. Its basically two stories in one and neither felt rushed or out of place, they truely had something for everyone and it changed up its theming often enough to keep you on your feet, while still having lasting characters and storylines that actually made you look forward to what comes next. Not only that, It tackled some really dark themes like death, grieving and mental health issues really well, showing a light to some things I didnt think FFXIV had the balls to touch. Wuk Lamat has been critizised as being one dimentional and a cliche but to be honest I think she was written to be exactly like that, as that is part of her flaws, which she notices and fixes throughout the story. She has a sort of bell-curve development, where she at first thinks her optimism was foolish but then sees with how fucked up the world can be that this sort of optimism is what gives us energy to push through, you just need to know how and when to use that energy and determination. Wuk Learned how to be HERSELF better rather then how to learn to be someone new and someone else, and honestly, with the amount of characters that change completely in the story it fits in pretty well.\n\nThe other characters I loved as well, i didnt like that Gulool and Bakool had little screentime but for the bit they had, i really liked them. The little side characters that had their short arcs were enjoyable as well, the entire rite of succession was the low-stakes fun adventure we really needed after Endwalker, and what followed was phenominal in its own right, Sphene and Zarool were really really well written in my opinion and going through Living Memory for the first time was something I honestly wasnt prepared for, the fact the music even cuts out and all the people you met in your short stay just... dissolve makes you really think about what is someone. Is it flesh and blood or can it be a machine and memory and is it right to preserve that. Its honestly a really good and also dark thing to think about and the MSQ did a wonderful job doing that. The first half does the fun adventure well, the second half does the more deeper, darker tones well, its a really good combo.\n\nLastly a lot of the gameplay things the expansion added are great, the new jobs are awesome, many of the reworks are super important and the quality of life is great as well. Of course we got an entire graphics overhaul, designed with suggestions by the fanbase, and it looks wonderful. It really makes me hope that FFXIV will stay around longer, we get more quality content like this and that passionate works of art like this can stick around in the bleak era that gaming is in right now.", "timestamp_created": 1721325671, "timestamp_updated": 1721325671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170180524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117253465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been a couple of weeks since the expansion came out and honestly, I couldn't be happier.

I love the characters, I think it's an interesting exploration of cultures and areas, of different peoples and I don't care what anybody else says, I like Wuk Lamat. I think she is an interesting character, filled with self doubt that a lot of people can relate to and overcoming it with the help of those around them, I like the competition being between one who thinks only of advancement, one who thinks only of war and one who thinks only of the people and how they could all learn from each other if they tried, and how easy it is to go down the wrong path. \n\nI really enjoyed the second half too, I love visiting another shard and seeing where another flood went down, this one a flood of lightning, and the technology they use. The use of souls and preservation of memories is especially interesting especially with today's advancements on AI and could very well be a future people see in 100, 200, 300 years, memories being tracked and uploaded to live forever in a world created just for them on servers. Maybe a bit far fetched, but not inconceivable and that's super interesting to me. \n\nThe duties themselves are all fantastic, there is difficulty in even the casual dungeons and trails and the new raid is my favourite out of every expansion.

Where do i begin with dawntrail... This whole expansion is relying on whether you like the central character(Wuk Lamat). And unfortunately i did not. Just think if Naruto, Goku, Asta and Luffy did a fusion dance and the thing that came out was the worst of their qualities. That is what Wuk Lamat is. Just a lame, loud, annoying, unlikable character who pulls off almost as many talk no jutsus as Naruto himself. And i get we are supposed to be backing her, but she legit has no redeeming qualities that a ruler of a NATION would or should have. Another thing i noticed was the very lack of battle scenes in this expansion. It was 30 hours of go there, talk to people about their culture, talk no jutsu them, than on to the next quest. It was very boring and it was almost to the point where i was skipping cut scenes. I get it, this is a new arc so they need to world build but this is nearly as boring as ARR without any of the highs that ARR brought. I also hate how they kinda force her down our throat all the time. When we need to go talk to people \"You're with Wuk Lamat\". When there is a battle cut scene \"You're with Wuk Lamat\". Like forcing her down our throats WILL NOT make us like her any better SE. SE tried to make a lovable, goofy character like Luffy or Naruto and failed miserably. Also Wuk Lamat showing up in her brothers trial was cringy and not needed at all, makes the replay ability go wayy down. Hell i wish we got the chance to defect to the second promise or something. Another thing. Alphinaud and Alisaie. Useless. Why are they here SE? They provide literally nothing substantial to the plot besides to say the most obvious shit ever. They don't move the plot forward at all, you can remove them and the plot would remain the exact same. I thought this was going to be the expansion where we explore SOLO, not with the twins.  I just love how one of the main focal points of this expansion (Krile) barely does anything. Are you serious? where this should have been her time to shine she literally doesn't do anything until the last quests of the expansion. I dont even want to get into the whole shitty tournament thing going on and how i spent like 3 hours with what was glorified beast tribe quests. Or i dont even want to get into Bakool Ja Ja and how his shitty backstory does not explain his actions at all, like if he wanted to make sure all the dead kids werent for nothing, why did he just fucking release that continent destroying bird . His actions do not match the motive, shitty writing SE. All in all, this expansion was a snoozefest with easily one of the worst written main cast characters we have ever had being shoved down our throat constantly for 30 hours. Easily worst than Stormblood, taking stormbloods spot as the second worst expansion so far.\n\nNow onto what i do love, i LOVE the graphical updates, good job SE. I love the new dungeons, i love the new job changes esp Scholar and Astro. And i love all the trials(ex and normal) and raids.

Yes, the story isn't as good as Shadowbringers or even Endwalker, but remember that those two built upon no less than 3 expansions worth of story that came before them. In my opinion, ShB is still peak with Heavensward coming as a close second. I think Dawntrail is better than Stormblood, and if you still enjoyed that one (as I did) you'll enjoy this one too. While I thought the main NPC character, Wuk Lamat, was a bit annoying at first, she grew on me as time went by. The second half of the story picks up the pace quite a bit so if you think the first part is too slow, it gets better I promise.\n\nIf you're more interested in the actual dungeons and fights, I got good news. With (imho) only one exception, the dungeons are all great and gorgeous looking to boot. The new city hubs are both grand and with good music, so great places to chill in between content.

Here we go. \nThe new graphics are great and they even fixed some of my major gripes from both of the benchmarks about my WoL. I was pleasantly surprised when I first logged in. The eye movements look so good on the characters. The new zones have stunning landscapes that are breathtaking and foliage density really makes it impressive. I still have no idea why I had so much fun doing random rock climbing excursions. The double dye system is too much power and now I greed for even more. I celebrated when the glamour dresser expanded but with new glamour horizons sacrifices will have to be made to fit it all. Some of those new rewards are going to have me locked in for a while. Looking at you fancy new Wings of Resolve and Ruin. \nThe music. Pure genius that set the tone perfectly for every zone and led my emotions around like the wave under a surfboard I was happy to ride. One dungeon in particular causes me to up the pace almost too much because I'm jamming out and not paying enough attention to the party. This orchestrion gathering is going to be brutal because I'm impatient. The finale song felt a bit out of place compared tbh. The ambient sound design is really well done. I noticed it especially in the new main city and it really helped me immerse myself. The new jobs are great fun but I am partial to viper because balancing the rotation speed with positionals, while dodging new mechanics I'd never seen before, seriously upped the battle high for me. And all jobs got lvl 100 abilities with flashy new vfx so I'm not complaining. As a whole, I definitely had a blast with this expansion. Still wrestling with the desire for world travel it ignited. I did not see that coming. My budget can't handle that. I don't seek out people so suddenly wanting to go meet people from a culture I know nothing about is odd. Increasingly having to tamp down searching out every cave, beach, temple, ancient artwork, waterfall, and weird rock formations that look interesting. The mountains nearby barely cut it. Travel brochures have become dangerous to me, thanks Yoshi P.\nI for one, greatly enjoyed this expansions story. This story did not rerun a previous expansion to make us do the same old plot lines like so many other games do. Just enough to tie it all together. After being the hero and saving the star, my WoL got the chance to step into a mentorship role. I wasn't sure about the babysitting at first but Gulool Ja Ja offered me a good fight as a bribe. I actually came to quite like the tone shift from always chasing down the problem, to stepping back. With the WoL experience giving them the judgement for when they were needed. After all my WoL has been through, all the lesson's learned, it does the people a disservice to solve all their problems for them. Encouraging others to grow is a difficult balancing act. Teetering between too much or too little aid. I'm so proud of my WoL for guiding Wuk Lamat so well. She was sheltered and naive, but smart enough to recognise this and brave enough to take the steps to correct it. Even when her courage faltered and the self-doubt crept in she learned to trust us over her own fears. \nThis expansion was full of subtleties you have to be paying close attention to or you will miss them. Maybe too subtle at points. For example she only appears to trust you at first but only because she hopes for you to be someone she trusts. There is the trust that someone will keep to their word verses the trust involved when fighting for your life. The deep trust of your fellow scion's is contrasted well with the ever increasing depth of trust Wuk Lamat has for you. Her immediate upset at being called her familial name she gave you permission you use by a certain Queen showcased this, and her growing political awareness by allowing the Queen to use it regardless. An unintended psychological trick on Wuk Lamat's part but one that worked in her favour later. She even proves her growth by taking back a request of her's she gradually realises you cannot accept by the simple fact of learning your WoL nature. I like that she recognises her own inexperience and relied on her brother to make up what she lacks instead of getting a inflated idea of her abilities because of the WoL's aid. \nMuch like ARR you spend time learning about the land and the people in it. As a lore hunter, Dawntrail was full of goodies and hints for me to ponder over. The foundation for this new house has been laid but the design is a mystery. If the dungeon and trial designs are any indication I'm going to have a great time. I had a lot of fun in these fights with some of the new tricks being thrown at us. The neighbours however will never understand why I was cursing at cacti and then switched to cursing at teacups. If you know, you know. \nI cycled through wonder at the new sights, curiosity about the myriad peoples, and then the contentment in getting to know their ways of life. Also feeling cheated at getting to see the gate but being shuffled away with only the promise of maybe getting to see it later. But as always in this game as soon as the right of succession was decided I was on pins and needles waiting for the hammer to drop. And drop it did. Good old XIV punching us with the tragedy feels. Anyone else see that little child crying over the dead body of his mother? I had to take a breather after seeing that. Sphene could look as sad as she wanted but I had zero forgiveness to give after that massacre and the clear harvesting of some energy from the dead. I almost hissed at my computer whenever my WoL would smile at Sphene in a cutscene and I wanted to give Wuk Lamat a good bonk for liking her. This game had me entirely hooked once more, hating a fictional character so much that I need a break with a punching bag. Meeting her people which just happened to all have devices on their heads? That our people had just been assimilated into? Was literally drowning in suspicion. Souls as currency? There is learning other peoples way of life but not when it involves the souls of your murdered people Lamaty'i. It seemed like they were trying to parallel your WoL story with Emet-Selch but between Wuk Lamat and Sphene. While we didn't need to learn the lesson of irreconcilable differences have nothing to do with the morality or personality of the people involved, Lamaty'i certainly did. So I'll give the writers a pass on that one. Solution Nine still didn't catch my interest because I was far too ready to be the villain and burn the place down. They hinted at it a bit too strongly so the big reveal of them essentially being soul cannibals and wanting to kill us all so they could live fell flat for me. I just wanted to fight already and they drew it out to the point of irritation. That many hints that things weren't as they seemed felt jarringly like being beat over the head for finishing the puzzle early. Uno reverse on on the subtle. The good fight soothed that irritation some. \nThey tried to force sympathy for Sphene was my issue. But the theme of this expansion seems to patience, for both the player and their WoL. The passiveness of the WoL made sense in the right of succession but as soon as you get the possibility that this might be another star endangering event that passiveness clashes badly considering the WoL past experiences. Not the right time for mentoring I'd say. It's not that Sphene is a poorly put together character, I just get repulsed by that personality type. Which is a very very round about way of saying that strong emotional response might actually indicate she's a good character by eliciting such a reaction. Not that I'll admit it. One character did not ruin this expansion for me thankfully. Take that XIV writers I'm getting used to your emotional whiplash. All in all, I'd recommend it. This is just the start of a new journey and theorising what is around the bend is part of the excitement! I can say I got what I came for with Dawntrail. \n", "timestamp_created": 1721180158, "timestamp_updated": 1721180158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170046219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389594750", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 273457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1394, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10\n\n- Story (MSQ) starts off slow but it really develops into something really interesting and easy to follow with a very sad but meaningful ending.

Spoilers are inside this and as such read at your own risk but I will do my best to black out spaces. \n\nStarting off Dawntrail Follows two Epics in which the story of FFXIV was concluded after years of waiting. To summarize here how I feel about the previous DLCs. A Realm Reborn is where I started playing the game and despite its rocky footing it was something special if a little fetch quest heavy. Heavensward (My Personal Least Favorite) laid foundation for what the game could be but had to ride the dick of the promise to see Ishgard from 1.0. As such it falls short and feels a little out of place but makes up for it in its patches. Stormblood while not received well pulled to story back to focus with the Garlean Empires influence on a global scale and introduced some of the best fights into the game. The Critically acclaimed Shadowbringers and its patches are a masterwork of writing and its bosses are great but differ from Stormblood with more cutscenes within the fights which I personally dislike. Active Time Maneuvers however help to break this jarring change. Endwalker opens strong by pulling almost all threads from previous DLCs and the base game into one narrative. Unfortunately Endwalker falls short with its villain as they feel rushed in like they ran out of ideas. Not to say I don't like it I do its just down with Heavensward for me as I feel it needed more time to be written better. \n\nWith my personal views on previous DLCs out of the way so you might better understand where I am coming from I think that Dawntrail is the perfect new beginning. The story while simple is perfectly polished and ties itself neatly together. Wuk Lamat seems to be a little hated among the fanbase but I think this is due to the [spoiler]\"I get sick on vehicles\"[/spoiler] bit that they just repeat for the first half. The joke was not funny at first and was not funny when they last did it. That being said taking a side role for half the DLC as the Warrior of Light is refreshing if not a strange choice. That being said I think this makes Endwalkers Lackluster ending better. \n\nFrom this point forward there will be spoilers as I go in depth. \n\n[spoiler] Dawntrail opens after the patches of Endwalker where we traveled to the 13th to help Zero and deal with Golbez. Wuk Lamat whom I will be referring to as Lamaty'i from this point forward seeks our aid in an upcoming tournament to decide her peoples ruler. One of four contestants she has traveled the ocean to seek foreign aid at the behest of a friend. We arrive in Tural and are introduced quickly to its Ruler. A good man who seeks to uphold peace he knows his time is coming and seeks to prove who should rule the throne. A game of trails ensues where we learn of the culture of Tural and its many peoples. The wars it has gone through and how it has impacted the lives of the contestants. As the contestants learn of their people they grow in a way that befits rulers excluding one. The true son of the king bent on bringing war sticks true to his path. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Through many tests Wuk Lamat and eventually her adopted brother learn to work together and he drops out of the race to help her to win. The head strong rival a non heir to the throne even concedes that Wuk Lamat is best fit. Suprise suprise with the help of Azem she wins and is crowned the Vow of Resolve and chooses her adopted brother to be the Vow of Reason to rule alongside her. The true son to the king bitter by his defeat steals the key to the prize of the contest and enters before we can. A portal to what was likely the twelth gives way to an advanced civilization which eats aether to sustain itself after its calamity. Becoming its king the true son attacks Tural and starts the war he wanted in the first place. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] As Azem we push to the front lines to assist and learn of its many people as is our duty as a member of the convocation. Choosing to stop the war and eventually save the source we take down the leaders of this civilization before they can do the same to us dooming them to their original fate in order to save our realm. [/spoiler]\n\nAs far as the story goes I like it alot. It shows us what our role in Ascian society would have been and gives more insight into what issues they caused. If I had to guess what will occur next I would say one of two things is possible. We are either going to go and check out the landing place of the dragons Meracydia and learn what is left to learn on our realm or we are going to head to the 4th, 8th, 9th or 11th shard like we did with the 1st. It is our job to see everything and understand as many cultures as possible. \n\nIf I had to give Dawntrail an overall theme it would be the Acceptance of Loss and Moving Forward. \n\nNext I would like to go over gameplay changes. While I am not well versed in all classes or content I will give my best based on how I usually play. \n\nBefore this DLC I mained the following Classes. \n\nTank: Paladin, Warrior\nDps: Samurai, Dancer, Summoner\nHealer: Sage (Don't play it much though)\n\nAfter this DLC this has changed to this. \nTank: Warrior\nDPS: Samurai, Pictomancer\nHealer: None \n\nBefore beating this DLC I got 7 Classes to level 100 easily. Leveling up did not take long outside of the first day when I picked up Pictomancer. \n\nThe New Classes Pictomancer and Viper are welcome additions however of the two Pictomancer stands out. When it was not Green Mage I was a little disappointed and from trailers I thought I would hate it but it is some of the most fun I have had with damage comparable to Blackmage in Stormblood. Viper on the other hand feels lack luster which is a shame as I have been waiting for another Sword DPS for a long time. There is nothing wrong with it but there is not anything right about it either. Its okay. At the time of writing this though I am only Level 96 with it so if they suddenly get better in 4 levels I might change my opinion. \n\nDungeons fucked this DLC. All of the dungeons are good including the post game content ones with one of the post game ones being my favorite in the whole game. \n\nTrials are hard as fuck. Something that changed this dlc in comparison to the last few is the speed of combat in instances. Dungeons now have bosses that hit hard and quick giving you little reaction time. Zeromus was fast before but all things in this DLC outclass his speed with some fights even feeling like Savage content. With this change though they introduced a warning system to alert you the first time something is about to happen. You are also punished harder for ignoring mechanics by any means including through Rez and knock back resistances. \n\nRole Quests which is a mechanic I hated when introduced but grew to like by the end of Shadowbringers are ruined by this DLC as they take the piss out of them for a joke storyline. Think Hildabrand level of stupid shit but tie it to finishing the dlc instead of being side content you can choose to skip. \n\nDawntrail is a solid 9 for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1721112343, "timestamp_updated": 1721112343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495540589094161987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169977620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128660375", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "the player character not being the focus of the story all the time might be a good thing actually", "timestamp_created": 1721109543, "timestamp_updated": 1721109543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472143948078155518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169977219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159395572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is so - so, but it hits well near the end. \n\nBattle content has never been better though", "timestamp_created": 1721108929, "timestamp_updated": 1721108929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495540589094161987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169976807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243563220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe the real FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail was the friends we made in the other expansions to suffer with", "timestamp_created": 1721108290, "timestamp_updated": 1721109427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495540589094161987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169976095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840656522", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "turkish", "review": "G\u00fczel dlc olmu\u015f.", "timestamp_created": 1721107244, "timestamp_updated": 1721107244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521000921726226807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169976037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113378726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I guess I'll give my two cents for this. \n\nDawntrail is an interesting expansion.

I don't judge it as harshly as a lot of people have but I won't try to beat around the bush. The story is weaker than the last expansion but that isn't really fair to discount it. Endwalker was the payoff and climax of over ten years of storytelling. Dawntrail is the start of something new. So I kind of went in expecting it to not be quite as big. \n\nI'll say that the first half of the story was jarring to me, I actually had trouble going through it for a bit. I felt like the big event of the first half was rushed with not enough I guess challenge for the character it centers around. I felt like the villains of that arc were a bit too easily folded. \n\nThe second half of the story was where I really enjoyed it. I liked the new world we got introduced to and the characters we met. The villains felt better than the ones from the first part though I know people will be arguing about what happened for a while. \n\nIn conclusion I will say that it was worth the money so far though I am biased.

And that Yoshi-P stated, that we should not expect an EW-level story. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nTbf, the story is kinda \"talk to Wuk Lamat\" for like 100 times and more a movie with plotholes than a game, but Endwalker had more cutscenes, just saying.\nFor me personally, the story was mid at best, the first part was enjoyable, but also avoidable at all points. The second part felt rushed and the villian was terribly written tbh. The whole situation was just unneccessary, rushed and the end was underwhelming imo.

Mostly lighting got fixed and we have new textures here and there. The game doesn't look as fantastic as Cyberpunk, but that was never the point, so nothing to complain here either.\n\n[h1]content patches[/h1]\nY'all should also not forget, that we now get (at least) 2 years of free content patches, including relic weapon, tribes, new trials, new dungeons, ally raids, normal raids, savage content, and more. \n\n[b]TLDR:[/b] Story aside, the new content is great so far.

Let me just stress that if you're trying out ffxiv, play the trial up to and including Stormblood. If ARR/HW hasn't caught you in story and Stormblood hasn't entertained you with gameplay. this review isn't even worth considering. \n\nIf you're sticking around, then expect Dawntrail to be more of a Stormblood-like expansion. It's certainly larger, prettier and more interesting. \n\nTLDR; Dawntrail is an easy 9.0 from me.\n\nThe good: Every zone has a story, looks amazing and there is something interesting going on. There are various stories to follow, plenty to keep you interested and lots of growth happening. It's happy good times. Until it's not, and then things are badass. The story essentially cuts into two chapters, both of them could have been an expansion in it's own right, but by compressing them together like this it's a coherent story which almost doesn't overstay it's welcome. The dungeons are phenomenal spectacles of vista's, with interesting mechanics and good looking drops. The trials test your mettle and prove to be great story beats as well.\n\nThe bad: Talk 3 three people, and then speak with Wuk Lamat again. Even though she's story centric, i'd love to have ditched her once or twice in favour of Erenville, Krile or the 4th promise. She overstays her welcome, and as other critics have pointed out, the voice acting misses a beat here or there, and because this happens in pivotal moments, it feels like the difference is rather stark between the EN and JP localizations. That said, if you take regular breaks from the story, Wuk doesn't become too overbearing. Since a few days after finishing the story, I look back fondly on the adventure there was. And that rather ebbs away the critic I had for Wuk as well.\n\nWhat remains then is a cool adventure in new lands. In my opinion, Shadowbringers and Endwalker shined because ARR, HW and StB setup an amazing story and they could land it. Dawntrail has to stand on it's own legs much more, this causes you to dig through a lot of setup before you go anywhere. This can be rewarded in future expansions, so whilst it affects the pace of the story, it breeds potential.

For some it'll be an ideal break from the themes of grief, loss and the god killing spree we went through in Endwalker, now having the chance to go out for some fresh low risk fun adventures in a new land while mentoring Wuk Lamat in her rites; but for others who crave the fanfare of being the main character in grand god killing adventures, this will feel like a boring trudge through mud, specially because [u]DT at its core is about Wuk Lamat, family, respect and love (and those can't be developed with rushed in new characters).[/u]\n[b]This being a new story will make it or break it for many:[/b] If you dislike the new introduced characters, you will likely be bored of the rest of the game bc we aren't in the main spotlight and neither is this story about the Scions who joining us, but if you loved the new characters? You'll enjoy seeing them grow and get stronger with your help.\nIf the second half of the game doesn't hook you in with its twists? Then you'll most likely be left with little of interest for anything upcoming since this isn't about our already established ascians anymore, and this plot is still on it's baby steps and unfolding as the first chapter of a new saga.\nDo I recommend this expansion? Yes! Will it be for everyone? Depends on what they want from it, so no.\n\nPersonally, I'd say Dawntrail isn't your [i]\"oh it's like ShB, the best expac where everything is good and 100% guaranteed you'll like almost all aspects of it bc it's so different from the previous expacs\".[/i] DT is a \"feels good like comfort food\" type of expansion that to me felt like a fresh breeze after all the doom and near universe end from Endwalker. This feels like it's a good starting point for the story that will be unfolding into interesting paths.\nRegardless of how I might feel about the characters or main story though, I have to commend the whole creative and research teams. The new zones are incredibly beautiful, the respect, research and love poured into it can be seen from all of the details and references to all North, Central and South Americas, and it can be felt.

Is it to the level of the best of the best this game had in its ten years? Not really but the \"Smile\" arc is by no mean bad, by the end of the expansion I had mostly memory holed most of the \"Dawntrail\" arc and I had forgiven altogether how bad those first 20h were\n\nIt deserves its mixed review score, the questline was extremely long and despites a lot of QoL, it was reminescent of how sluggish ARR felt at times, its lack of mostly any encounters and a boring story about what another review called \"a very long tribe quest\" warrants more than enough such a lower score compared to the other expansions, Tural is by no mean a bad place, I enjoyed a lot of its lore and some of the tribes were interesting but like an anchor preventing ships from leaving port, Wuk Lamat's bad writing prevented anything good to truly come out of it, even more emphasized when every issue is solved by a glorified \"we can be friends\"\n\nThe last 10h of the game were rejuvenating to say the least, if some of it was still REALLY long, it was significantly more meaningful than anything done in the other 2/3 of the expansion, I must conceed this however, the \"Dawntrail\" arc fit extremely well for the end of the \"Smile\" arc and did not feel all in all entirely wasted, even Wuk Lamat believe it or not\n\n\"Dawntrail\" arc? 2/10, entirely deserves to be crowned \"Worse than A Realm Reborn\", please don't bring up Wuk Lamat near me I will cry\n\"Smile\" arc? 8/10, the real meat of this expansion, filled with enjoyable and great content that unlike the rest would be to my eyes immensely memorable, if it wasn't for the first 60 quests it would place well above Stormblood in my opinion\n\nConclusion?

While I thought the new areas in the first half were alright, the areas introduced later on had me enamored. When it comes to the story, one could describe it as a \"mixed bag.\" I enjoyed it, but it was a story that got better overtime. That isn't to say that the early hours were bad, but I much more enjoyed the later half of the story. Wuk Lamat was alright as a character. Given the plot, it makes sense that she'd get a lot of attention. I just don't have too strong of a opinion on her. I was more interested in Krile's story in the expansion and I was happy with how they fleshed out her backstory and character.\n\nThe first arc of the story was straight forward, if not predictable. To be fair its one of those story arcs with an ending you can see from a mile away. However, there were some surprises that I enjoyed throughout it. I'm unsure if this was just me, but the second arc of the story felt \"faster.\" Despite that, I'll probably remember it more than the first half. At first, I was unsure of the different direction, but I quite liked where it went. It was satisfying to play through from beginning to end.\n\n[spoiler]When Yoshi P said to do the Aloalo island content before Dawntrail, I didn't see much of a connection except maybe one or two references to it in the first half.

I doubted the whole premise of going on some \"vacation\" from the start. Maybe you were looking forward to playing something close to that? I don't know.

However, the delivery of some lines in key moments felt flat or out of place and it took away some of my emotional attachment to the story when it could've added so much more depth (think of that incredible Lina moment in Shadowbringers with all the emotions the VA delivered, it's what I'm referring to).\n\nFinally, while this can seem nitpicky from my part, the main voiced track just felt out of place and didn't click with me at all. I wish it did because FFXIV OST is one of the best aspects of the game for me, but it just didn't and it also took some emotional attachment away from the scenes and ending. The OST in general is really nice, though and I'm looking forward to have it officially released!\n\nSo I recommend the expansion because even if I have issues with all the points I mentioned above, the dungeons and trials are amazing and there's room for a lot of fun and engaging gameplay after finishing MSQ and the story in general is nice, just not great. I'm looking forward to patch content.\n\nP.S.: SE, please think about reverting some key changes that took away all the fun EW BLM had! The changes aimed to kill non standard made standard really clunky as a result, at the same time raising the skill floor and lowering the ceiling.

I am reminded of how many people did not enjoy another character from the Stormblood expansion. It is bewildering to me that this would be enough, but then again I enjoyed the character and their growth throughout the expansion. I understand that the fact that the player character is taking more of a supportive role in this new story rather than being the main character. It would be fair to say that this time the main character is Wuk Lamat and I understand how it might upset some people. But to the point of not recommending the whole expansion? I find that bewildering.\n\nPersonally, I decided I loved the expansion at the level 95 dungeon. Though I was annoyed at some of the story. If you could divide the story into three parts, I would say that the middle one was a bit weak. But it picks back up by the end and finishes nicely. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling anything.\n\nMore than anything, there is a richness in the world which is expended drastically in that expansion. The environments are beautiful and some of the music is breathtaking. As some of the latest expansion, it tackles themes that are o so interesting to me. While some of the great stakes and themes are similar to those previously presented, they are seen from a different point of view or at least offered with a different enough presentation to feel fresh and worthwhile to think about.\n\nThe music is simply amazing, as ever with this game. The combat, though I wish SquareEnix would bring back more responsibility regarding tanks and positioning the enemies, is great, some of the changes to classes are much welcome and the difficult fights so far have been enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, I can hardly fathom talking to someone about this expansion and hearing them say they hated it. Mostly, someone might disappointed about something might have been handled, but everyone in my FC have thoroughly enjoyed DT and so have I.\n\nIf I have one complain that I agree with a lot of people on here, it's that the villains' motivations are not as clear as they should have been, or take time to come into view.

The new dungeons are fantastic and bring new mechanics and refreshing spins on existing mechanics (pun intended ;) ). Some of the fights in the MSQ are surprisingly challenging in all the good ways: No unfair mechanics or tedious dragging out past their welcome. It's always nice to return to FF14 and have a quality game waiting for me.\n\nThere are some issues imo but they do not warrent a thumbs down! The story suffers from a pacing issue but I go against the grain and will say that it's not slow enough. Hear me out. (And mild, story beads hinting spoiler ahead.)\n\nThere are ideas and character development that could have been expended out further in the first half of the MSQ to flesh out the world and the villains. My impression was that unfortunately Dawntrail suffers from being in the shadow of the gargantuan world-ending threats Endwalker introduced and overcame and the writing in this expansion seems to feel the need to escalate the stakes to a slightly less but still world-ending level in order to measure up to its predecessor expansions.

New dangers and threats mean you're basically putting a hard reset of the high stakes.\n\nLooking back on realm reborn, I only turned to this game because another MMO basically burnt me out, and despite ARR's rather dull story, I was still captivated enough to try something entirely different with a completely change of pace in a new world.\n\nComing hot off the heels of Endwalker where all of creation is at stake, trying to sell an expansion on the idea of it being a holiday is hard, but to CBU3's credit, they've yet to fully let me down and make me hate a game, so I played it.\n\nFrom start to finish, I rode the waves of the story, and let things play out...\n\nAnd I loved it. All of it. The change of pace was a refreshing. For this story you are no longer the main character, you get to sit back and let someone else go through growth in their rise to be the Dawnservant (Basically the king and/or queen of the land).\n\nYou watch them go forth with some pretty lofty ideals and despite the resistances they meet, things workout... whilst also competing alongside an interesting villain type and a rather cookie cutter villain type.\n\nWithout spoiling anything further, I will just say I love how this story developed, how it continued to surprise me and keep me wondering. The carrot on the stick effect of finding the golden city was a joy.\n\nNow if you're going into this expecting the stakes to continuously get higher despite saving the entirety of creation in the previous expansion... just slow down, you cannot get higher stakes than that, things need to cool down or the entire series may as well have ended in 7.0\n\nI liked that things slowed down and we got to ramp things up again, it was almost nostalgic to encounter a villain that had similar ideals to the main villain of ARR and I think this was a deliberate choice narratively.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this wholeheartedly.\n\nAlso yes I know Wuk Lamat is a little annoying at times, she's basically a kid trying to wear big adult shoes.

I pour thousands of hours into this game, and even got a hand-sized tattoo related to a previous expansion done on my back - which is saying something considering it is only the third I've ever gotten done and by far the largest of the three. I would have preferred to give a neutral review than either \"Yes\" or \"No\" and I debated which to select for a long time, but I decided to give the expansion the benefit of the doubt. All things considered, it may be one of the least impressively written storylines in FFXIV, but it's still much better than most video game storylines (and especially MMO storylines).\n\nI actually like Wuk Lamat, and was excited to see where this adventure would take us and her. I was thrilled by the prospect of a more relaxed adventure full of discovery and excitement, and an opportunity to bring my WoL back to her roots as a thrill and culture-seeking explorer, searching for new worlds and new experiences for the fun and joy of it. \n\nI won't deny that some of this did happen! We learnt a lot about new cultures and races never before seen and even got a cool friendly sparring match with a very cool new character. They did sort-of succeed in giving us a kind of \"cultural vacation-y\" vibe in the first bit, but it was wrought by the burden of participating in high-stakes political struggle which just goes to show that less is sometimes more.\n\nA lot of people have already commented on how it felt more like a \"Babysit Wuk Lamat\" adventure, that her confidence grew but not her capabilities, and that other characters' personalities and ability to have an opinion in any matter got pushed to the side because \"Wuk Lamat has to do this and be cool and save her people\" - which I agree with save for one private moment near the end with G'raha Tia, which was painfully obviously written by someone else. \n\nSo I will touch on a few other things that bothered me about this expansion. Heavy spoiler warning ahead, though I will do my best to censor much of it. I will split the story into 2 main plot segments - A and B. \n\n1. While plot segment A was fun and engaging in my opinion, mainly because I loved the cultural introductions to the new races and societies (and their primary characters), it felt stretched out and took way too long, and at several parts, even someone like me who has done every single yellow sidequest in the game felt bored at times. I understand that they needed to take time to build the new world and build the new world they did - VERY thoroughly. But several of those moments of faffing about and clicking nameless NPCs and items could have been cut down and still had the same impact, and we would have finished those quests in 2-3 levels rather than 5. By making plot segment A stretch out this long, the much more complicated, high-stakes end of Dawntrail could have been hashed out better, which brings me to:\n\n2. Plot segment B felt extremely rushed - like they tried to cram the entirety of Shadowbringers into 4 levels with most of the lore and emotion-intensive parts shoved right to the end. The character we faced in the ultimate battle felt like they had potential as both a misguided anti-hero and villain, but because they didn't have many opportunities to take centre stage and were completely denied any chance to properly explain themselves save for a couple of relatively unemotional explanations of the past, they ended up feeling like a poorly hashed-out antipathetic/unsympathetic Emet Selch and Meteion hate-child. \n\n3. There was a significant ethical conundrum explored near the end - a topic that has resonated throughout history in literature and pop culture was attempted to be brought to light. Except, how it was handled, in my opinion, was loathsomely disappointing and a terrible way to end the already disappointing expansion. This is especially felt since a similar topic had been handled far better just one expansion ago. It left me more angered at the resulting poorly executed visual effect, the utter lack of sensitivity, the identical quest structures in each zone, and the rushed cramming-in of otherwise fascinating plot points with heavy implications than stirred or morally \"educated\" by the story. \nIt is so painfully obvious that they are trying to teach us, adult players with real-life knowledge and experiences, how to handle one of the sadder experiences in life as they quite literally spell it out - which would be somewhat fine if it was also not done as insensitively and forcefully as it was, with the writers smiling and cheating their way out of exploring any realistic conflict or emotions. \n\nEither way, I hope the post-expansion quests improve upon these issues and give us the story we really wanted.", "timestamp_created": 1720765920, "timestamp_updated": 1720765920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53271031379699707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169658681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085581468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Great expac but for some reason half of the dialogue was given to a single character", "timestamp_created": 1720765632, "timestamp_updated": 1720814490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169651087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063978111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "\"You ask a lost man for the way.\"", "timestamp_created": 1720756532, "timestamp_updated": 1720756532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169648019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065693991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing through this expansion and having some time to sit on it, I can definitely see where people are coming from that may not have liked it. Things are never going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed this expansion. I enjoyed the story, the new settings, and even the new characters. It should be noted, that I went into this expansion not expecting it to be like Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but rather more akin to A Realm Reborn. In my mind, the first entry in the new saga and follow up to Endwalker was never going to be on that same level since it is the start of something new. \n\nThe dungeons, trials, and first raids have been some of the most enjoyable ones that I've experienced with my time in the game. And the last two zones in particular have been some of my favorites. \n\nHowever, I think the flaw with this expansion is that it feels like two stories are happening. Without getting into spoilers, the first four zones feel like their own story and entails your journey through the competition that you were brought here for. The last two zones kinda come out of nowhere and feel vastly different than the other two thirds of the expansion. What I would have preferred is a more fleshed out story with the competition and power struggle for this new area. I'm fine with not being the \"main hero\" as long as the story overall is still good. That being said it is weird that no one talks about how you are literally the savior of the entire world. (What were the people in Tural doing during Endwalker? The entire world was being threatened not just the known world.)\n\nAnd as much as I loved the final third (mostly due to the references to a particular Final Fantasy, the last zone being probably my favorite zone in the entire game), I think I would have preferred if it was saved and made a focal point for it's own expansion (something more like Shadowbringers). This would have allowed characters like Wuk Lamat, Zorral Ja, and Bakool Ja Ja to be more fleshed out. Having the story revolve around a power struggle could have been much better and a compelling way to introduce this new continent. That being said, for what it was, I didn't mind the story and rather enjoyed many parts of it. But I will still acknowledge that it could have been better. While it didn't take away my enjoyment of the game, it definitely can for some people, especially if you are solely playing for the story.\n\nUltimately, I think this is a great expansion with some of the best gameplay that FF14 has had and while the story has been a rocky start, it introduces a lot of possibilities for where they can take it. Unfortunately this means that it will most likely end up as ARR 2 for most people: a story that people will rush through to get to the good stuff afterwards. All that said, I would still recommend this expansion purely due to the new dungeons, trials, raids (so far), and jobs added into the game.

Encounter design (as of writing in patch 7.0) is excellent, with both extreme trials being a ton of fun and novel in their own regards. Dungeon structure is dramatically improved upon previous expansions, with almost certainly the best leveling dungeons so far. The first graphics update is spectacular and most of the music is to the caliber a fan of FFXIV will expect. Pictomancer is a blast to play and a real contender for the most fun job Square has ever made, and Viper is fast and flashy if perhaps lacking a bit in unique identity. Several jobs are at a bit of a low point (Black Mage, Summoner, Monk, Dragoon, and to varying degrees all of the tanks, healers, and physical ranged DPS), but there's enough variety in combat roles at this point that most people will find at least a handful of jobs that they resonate with, even if they might not be their old favorites.\n\nMost of the negative reviews are going to focus in on the character writing or voice direction of new character Wuk Lamat, but I never found myself disliking her to any meaningful degree. Certainly there are moments in the story where she comes off as naive or excessively tolerant, but in a game full of grandiose, melodramatic characters, I don't feel as though an excessively optimistic protagonist is too far out of place. Given the option to do post-Endwalker and Dawntrail over, I think Square would have elected to introduce her and the continent of Tural earlier, to present exposition that unfortunately has to be in the early levels of Dawntrail proper. As it stands, it does feel as though parts of the level 90-93 story drag on a bit, but once the full narrative gets moving it's largely enjoyable with only a few missed notes.\n\nIf Dawntrail can keep up the gameplay improvements that it's introduced so far, and if the content roadmap that Square has previously shown can be kept to, then I think there will be a strong argument for it being the XIV expansion, even if the main narrative never hits the emotional highs that we've come to expect of the game. Even if not, FFXIV is still an excellent game, but some of the cracks in the formula are starting to show after a decade of iteration. Hopefully Square takes all the negative feedback into consideration and knocks it out of the park in 8.0. Until then, most will likely enjoy their time in Dawntrail, even if they may be bored for a few hours during its narrative.", "timestamp_created": 1720731951, "timestamp_updated": 1720731951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499693810939788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169625022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098979593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "SPOILER ALERT!!!!\n\nAcredito fielmente que quem est\u00e1 reclamando da hist\u00f3ria e da estrutura s\u00e3o as pessoas que ficaram tristes pq nosso personagem n\u00e3o derrotou nenhum Deus ou Ascian novo nessa expans\u00e3o.

The last two expacs have been touted as possibly the best FF stories of all time, and its cemented a special place in many hearts because of that. Ishikawa managed to write two empathetic stories back to back that resonated deeply during times of crisis.\n\nHence we all return for Dawntrail, knowing full well the stakes are unlikely to be as high, but actually I believe there was potential for that height to be reached again. WIth Shadowbringers we had a bizarre adventure in an upside-down world that made us question our perspective on righteousness while simultaneously tackling themes of grief and loss. Endwalker gave us an existential climax taking us beyond creation and purpose itself.\n\nDawntrail on its surface could be a tight-knit found family story about coming to terms with your own birth, your place in the world, and learning to co-exist with others. A story about life's whole journey including its untimely ends. Maybe even references to Day of the Dead in this heavily Latin American-inspired journey through some of the coolest and prettiest zones the game has seen. The broad strokes of this expac could be just as powerful as the last two, but with Ishikawa stepping down as the writer and taking a managerial role, I feel the execution was lacking.\n\nWhat we got instead was simply told through the lens of a shounen side-arc. The emotions and villain writing took too much a back-seat to intense amounts of talk-no-jutsu. Wuk Lamat was actually a character I enjoyed, actually the entire dawntrail cast is arguably the most likeable in all the expacs, but there is too much time spent on mundane parts of the game to flesh them out. The writer of pandaemonium wrote this MSQ and I feel it shows. The villain motives could only be described as cartoonishly sociopathic, and we never really got to fully explore their cryptic backstories before just killing them. Much like the Zero arc before it, it feels like FFXIV is employing an almost gacha-game like tactic of attaching us at the hip to one character at a time, and shoving that character in our face and hoping we all come out adoring them.\n\nThat said if you're here to play the game, this is the most fun the content has ever been, and the prettiest the game has ever looked. I'm leaving this review here because I hope the team takes all the negative feedback to heart on a story that I think its important to so many people to not disrespect its legacy. I'm optimistic about what it could've been, but thats just it. It didn't live up to its potential.

I really wish there was a way to leave a more specific score and not just GOOD/BAD but I guess that's what these comments are for. \n\nDawntrail had a lot of good points. Nothing overly spectacular but there's a lot in it that I quite liked. Pictomancer was super fun, I liked the music and I liked the environments a lot.

BUT, lugging her around come to feel like having a Disney princess following you around. She really does have a severe case of Talk No Jutsu and it makes any sort of character development feel super anticlimactic. It doesn't sound so bad but it's executed so poorly that it becomes sorta abrasive. Once it happens a few times you start dreading each time she's on screen. It's like \"Oh no, what important moment will she ruin this time...!?\". I understand that things are supposed to have a different focus this time around and I appreciate the challenge the writers have in establishing a new foundation, but this just feels, unfocused and poorly executed to me.

We're still the \"Champion of Eorzea,\" but the point of our adventurer is to take a break from being that \"Champion.\" To go to a new place, meet new people, see new things. And, as our story unfolds, find ourselves in a bunch of trouble that we (our characters) enjoy just a little too much. A through-line in the expansion's story is grief and loss, resilience, and the bitter-sweetness that comes with acceptance.\n\nYou cannot compare Dawntrail to Endwalker. The two expansions serve entirely different purposes, and have entirely different tones (though many of the same themes continue to permeate these stories, which shouldn't be spurned - they're staples of all Final Fantasy tales). \n\nThe point of this review is to give people a clear idea of the narrative they'll experience in Dawntrail without spoilers.

The story of course started slow at the beginning but in my opinion it's as slow as all the other expansions at the beginning, so it didn't bother me too much, as I was excited to learn about the new characters. I think the first half, while slow, was necessary to develop the new characters and their motivations. It really ramps up in the second half and it has some of my favorite zones and music.

I also highly suggest playing with anything other than English voice-acting as I made the mistake of doing so because I'm used to the other VAs from prior expansions. No shade to Wuk's VA but the consistent flat delivery with the accent made it hard to like the character at first.\n\nOverall, positive experience, would recommend just on the basis of dungeon/trial content alone!

Normally FFXIV's storytelling is the star, and certainly no one expected it to meet or surpass the standard set by Endwalker, but in this expansion the story is burdened by things that 'need to' happen instead of following the natural curiosity and inclinations of the player.\n\nNew areas and environmental design: 10/10, the glowy forest is absolutely peak.\n\nBattle content: 10/10, refreshingly challenging while also maintaining the ethos that players should be able to learn the fights as they play them for normal content.\n\nNew classes: 10/10, Viper is smooth as silk and an absolute joy to play. I haven't touched picto yet but the aesthetic is immaculate.\n\nNew skills: 10/10, Sage's AOE dot and Dancer's new finishers just *feel* good. 'Revisit' on botanist and miner is the biggest jolt of dopamine I've felt in a long time.\n\nGlam: 9/10, too much of a focus on futuristic and weirdly kinky shit for my taste, but the Dancer artifact gear alone is worth the 40$ I paid for this expansion. The two dye channels are game-changing and I have already squandered millions of gil on it. Peak content. \n\nGraphics: 10/10, The character and environment redesign is profoundly respectful of the spirit and 'look' of the old game while advancing the quality by leaps and bounds. I have taken literally hundreds of gposes in the last two weeks simply because I can't help it- the lighting, the colors, the plants, and my own WoL are an immaculate visual treat.\n\nMusic: 9/10, Soken is a master at work. He took some big risks here, but the Shaaloani daytime theme and the trial boss fight music are all-time bangers. 'Smile' suffered severely from strained and uncomfortable vocals.\n\nVoice Acting: 8/10, I loved Galool Ja Ja's voice actors in particular. I would personally throw myself into the flames for the cowboy catboys in Shaaloani. Wuk Lamat's VA doesn't deserve the level of hate she's gotten, especially considering that this is (one of?) her first major roles, but no one is gonna defend that 'spheeeeeene listen to me' line. Honestly I think we might have to blame poor directing on that one.\n\nMounts and Minions: 10/10, capybara and a very cute cat. No notes.\n\nMSQ: 6.5/10, and it hurts to say that. I really, really, really wanted to like it, but I never really felt 'involved' in the story- more like a witness. I'm a person who enjoys visiting new places and learning about the cultures, but after 20 or so hours of worldbuilding I started to get tired. I enjoyed the second half a lot more than the first. By the end of the story I had cried a few times. Despite how slow it felt at times the final area threw a grief-shaped brick at my head and left me sobbing. Even though the first half was slow, I really appreciated how the writers took respectful inspiration from real-world cultures and proactively demonstrated cultural appreciation over appropriation.

Great tunes, great areas and setting. The story works. It's not as good as the last two xpacs, but the comparison feels unfair as that part of the story had a foundation built up over years. \n\nI can level some criticism at it. \n\nThe first half of the story is a laid back adventure, almost in the style of a classical folk tale, spanning interesting locales, themes, and paying homage to cool things. It works well enough. It's low stakes and pretty comfy. My main bone to pick with it if i had to choose one, is that the direction of it is a little crude in places, and some cutscenes can end up feeling a little stunted. There is still plenty of awesome. Newly introduced characters have functioning arcs for the most part, though the motivation for some feels underdeveloped, and some characters feel a little one-dimensional at times. \n(e.g. while Wuk Lamat has a decent self-actualization kind of arc, she's too much of a goody two shoes and could've used a darker side imo, perhaps something she could've struggled with, rather than being the TOGETHER WE CAN mascot she often is)\n\nThe second half of the story ups the stakes, the scope, and the drama. It works well enough, and the focus shifts away from character arcs to subtext and commentary, which is not uncommon with Final Fantasy storytelling in general. There is room to think and ponder if you're into that, and i was. Once again the story suffers a little from under-developed motivations that make the antagonist side of things feel stupider than it had to be, though the writing is competent enough to cover for that effectively by the end. The writers are obviously aware of the gaps, and did enough to fill them in with a little suspension of disbelief, though there was room for more. By the end, even if it doesn't hit as hard as Endwalker did, it still successfully tugs at heartstrings and pushes the feels button in several places.\n\nAs to the main character's role in the story, it's the passenger seat. Thinking back on it now, i sort of feel like it would have been better if they'd taken either a more passive role, or a more front-and-center one, but as it is it's sort of awkwardly in the middle. It's a Wuk Lamat & Friends story, but you still do the heavy lifting by necessity. That said, nothing here is bad or offputting in any way.\n\nOn the whole, it's been a good expansion for me and i'm happy to see where they take it from here, with a little more to build on. The 'content' is as good as it's ever been if not better. The fights are great, the mounts are cool, the monsters, areas and gear are awesome. The graphical update is a really nice and welcome addition. The characters are cool and memorable, and whatever failings the story has i am counting as growing pains in the transition from the old towards the new.\n\ntl;dr is good, don't worry about it\n\nP.S. It's REALLY cool to see elements of meso-american cultures, and how neatly they're integrated into the gameworld.

This is not an end to an 9 Year story or like how stormblood into shadowbringers story of saving our friends. This is what it is a new start to a new world we will get to adventure. The MSQ is a sole expansion story that will bring good questions and answers, which kept me engaged through the story. Keeping in mind that knowing the smallest of background details and lore drops are big hints to what is to come for FFXIV. There was a few times that the MSQ dropped a lull of a quest and breaks did occur during the over-arching story. This breaking of the pace, before ramping it up again, was jarring. I did enjoy Wuk Lamat as her character engagement is on par from Lyse and Hyen. Her personality and direction does show the growth, unlike Lyse. Who, by the time we entered the Stormblood MSQ; only had to answer the question of \"how will she lead a revolution?\" Lyse already had growth part of the 3.x patches and her growth into a revolutionary leader was set to be the sole character story focus of stomblood. Where as Wuk Lamat does not have that growth prior as she is a new character and as her story unfolds the growth is set up as intended. The MSQ does a good job balancing the focus on the major Tulliolal cast making it truly an adventure you are on. Rather than the Scions and their world saving endeavors. I did feel enjoyment for the MSQ and cannot wait to see what comes next in the 7.x story patches. There are subtle and unsubtle hints of world progression that I know Square Enix and CBU 3 will build off of in the future.\n\nI have friends who i recommend waiting until about the 7.3 patch to return as that usually is the completion of the 7.0+X story excluding Endwalker. As they need more than just the base expansion story when returning. They love raid content but also like the story but need more. knowing them i recommend waiting until the 7.3 patch. Which should add two 8 man raid series, two 24 man raids, after MSQ story, Potential added Trial raid series (unless they pull an endwalker), a Explorer zone ( Bozja and Eureka like content), and Galaxy exploration. which all is what i know they would be happy to pay for a subscription for.\n\n\nLastly to everyone complaining about Wuk Lamat, If you are reading this and have joined post Stormblood During Shadowbringers let me say this. None of us at the time of the 2.x Patches knew how big Haurchefant could be played in the havensward expansion.  The community thought Hyen would play a bigger role in the Stormblood Expansion but he saw very little time. If there is a character you do or don't enjoy. Just know you have no idea how square will utilize them in the future. It could be a lot or very little. Just go with the flow.She is your \"Pray Return TO THE WAKING SANDS MOMENT.\" It happens in MMO's and CBU3 has earned my trust that it didnt bother me as to me it was expected..and please no more boats. She isn't woke or even is part of an agenda, it's a NPC who leads you through her story. You are just along for the ride; like Hydalen did with us for 10 Years, even Zero afterward. The world is building and SE is just creating characters to deliver us to the story. Don't read in to it too much because none of the other countries VA's are trans, they used her as she applied and did the best for the character they wrote.", "timestamp_created": 1720649007, "timestamp_updated": 1720651205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535430788993835449", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169541169", "author": {"steamid": "76561199536151035", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 52954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1178, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "SPOILER WARNING:\n\n\nYall the story is still great just not as great as it used to be. Which makes sense we saved the world twice in a row and i would be annoyed if we did so a third time in a row. Dawntrail's story still does plenty of things great but you all refuse to acknowledge so. The worldbuilding of Tural is incredible I feel like it goes very well in depth into each tribe's cultures and their significance to the overall lore of tural especially if you do the side quests. Also sure you may be mad you interact with Wuk too much but what were you expecting going into this expansion? I feel like it was clear that this would be very focused around Wuk. And even if you still don't like how much you interact with Wuk i feel like 50% of the time you do interact with her it usually shifts the focus from her to someone or something else real quick. And if you still don't like that then the second half of the msq is way better and I do not know what to tell you.\n\nAnyways moving on from story stuff the new bosses in dungeons and trials and whatever are way better and feel a lot more unique(I still wish dungeons weren't hallways though but I understand why they are still that way)\n\nAs a mount collector I love the new mount designs. The graphics update is also incredible. When it was first announced I was worried about my fps dropping but when I got in my fps has not dropped whatsoever. \n\nI feel overall that dawntrail is a great expansion and yall just need to lower your standards a little for the story. Give CBU3 about 1 or 2 more expansions to do a bit more story buildup and then we will get something as great as shadowbringers and endwalker. 9/10 expansion(will probably change review over time as more content gets released for dawntrail)\n\nFirst edit and it hasn't even been 10 minutes: i just feel like saying I like bakool ja ja's character development although it isn't all too detailed. Along with that I love Wuk Evu he is so silly i love him. At this point ima just list character's i love: The railway trio(i cant remember all their names lol) Koana(I just like that he is a caring sibling and a good one at that) Zekowa(hes honestly just chill like that) Bakool Ja Ja(even though he doesn't get as much screen time as he should dawntrail still manages to go deep into his lore with the different Sagas on those stone things in Tuliloyyal) Bakool Ja (Baby mamool ja need i say less?) Wuk Lamat's real father(honestly the best elector and I won't even explain why) Otis(honestly it was quite sad seeing him die and it was nice to see that there was actually someone caring for Bakool Ja) Cahciua( I was not expecting Erenville's mother to be this enthusiastic considering erenville is very calm and collected. honestly it was a nice surprise also i love the nicknames she gives erenville) Mablu(Although not important she is very relatable with the \"i wanna go down this career path but i don't know if (insert literally anyone here) would approve\")\n\n(also btw the way the

Specifically for the non-story related content. The battle content itself is the best they've ever created. The music, the aesthetic, the visual designs, the graphical and system improvements, it's all been spectacular. I'm really looking forward to what's to come. With that being said, It is clear to me that the developers listen to their player base which is why I wish to provide some critical feedback.\n\n[h1] Main Story Questing  [/h1]\n\nI play this game for the battle content, the economic element with crafters & gatherers and of course most important of all, looking good while doing it. I've never been interested in the main story of this game and will not be making comment on the plot. To me the MSQ is an obstacle which must be overcome in order to access the real content of the game. The actual tasks that are required of you during the questing of the MSQ are outdated and need significant improvement. I do not understand why there are still unskippable cutscenes in a modern release. I do not want to click on 8 different pillars in Tuliyollal one at a time. I do not want to search for a random npc deliberately hidden from line of sight in a large area. Aether current locations often trick the player with elevation requiring rerouting with mobs placed within aggro range. Flying should be granted for the zone at the same point in which you gain the MSQ aether current. The trailing quests are back and although they are improved are still a time sink. \n\nThe instanced content was disappointing to me. I was optimistic that after the instance within the quest \"The Game Is Afoot\" (patch 6.55) that this would be a baseline for innovation within this aspect of the game but the player in Dawntrail still never has any agency. It's immersion breaking when a boss sits on 0.1% HP obviously invulnerable because we must wait on a line of dialogue. It's disheartening to me to go into these knowing that my input ultimately doesn't matter. These instances are completely scripted. I will likely be completely healthy for the entire fight only to be one shot because the script demands it.\n\nAll my issues with the main quest can all be summarised by saying that the questing is not interesting.  It's tedious and frustrating. It's not challenging or engaging, and it blatantly disregards the players' time.\n\n\n[h1] Job Design and Systems [/h1]\n\nWhile the action change setting is a welcome addition, I thought that we would be able to condense combo'd abilities into a single button similar to when you control alternative characters in story content. I don't believe that there would be a meaningful loss in skill expression if ninja's 1->2 AOE combo was given the option of being a singular morphing button. I highlighted AOE combos because they can often be irrelevant depending on the content that you're doing while still taking up space on your hotbar. The system is also inconsistent. If we take ninja again for example. Bushin can be both combo and separate from Phanom Kamaitachi but Ten Chi Jin can not be separated from Tenri Jindo. Both options should be available for both pairings.\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to being able to combo single target rotations on jobs that made sense for it. Ninja's and Warrior's 1->2->[3/4] or reaper's 1->2->3. This option obviously shouldn't be an option for jobs (among others) such as Dragoon and Monk.\n\n[h3]Gunbreaker[/h3]\nHappy to hear that Trajectory will be getting an enmity effect in 7.01. In general I'm really happy with the changes to this job. The Lion Heart combo shouldn't interrupt your gnashing fang but I believe this was acknowledged as a bug. I'm content with Fated Brand's addition but it is personally an awkward button to press in AOE with my specific hotbar layout. I don't believe its addition was meaningful or a net gain. An option to Link Fated Circle with Fated Brand would have been nice here.\n\n[h3]Sage[/h3]\nSage lost some of its gracefulness within dungeons. In Endwalker when running alongside trash you would apply your dot because it's instant cast and then AOE once the pack is stationary. Now with the addition of Eukrasian Dykraisa which overwrites Eukrasian Dosis III the more potent dot, there is an over reliance on Toxikon II to maintain mobility and optimal DPS (a resource which situationally may not be available). A simple remedy to this would be that Eukrasian Dykraisa should not be able to affect targets effected by Eukrasian Dosis III. This way you can single target dot while moving and also AOE dot the grouped mobs without concern of overwriting a freshly applied dot . This method would still avoid the single target double dot oversight from the media tour.\n\n[h3]Monk[/h3]\nI want to acknowledge first that I understand that this job is bugged and that several components are not functioning as intended. From my perspective clear issues like this are distractions as eventually they will be rectified as stated by Naoki Yoshida.\n\nMonk was my main job in Endwalker. Upon looking at the changes presented at the media tour it was clear to me that the developers actually understood the issues pertaining to the job. Brotherhood allowing you to over cap your chakra during burst is an elegant way to prevent clipping with monk's fast skill speed. Inspirited Meditation is another great addition. I also believe that the sticker system is effectively the same system to the Endwalker dots and buffs system but presented in a much clearer and intuitive way. Additionally I won't be mourning the loss of optimal drift. The problem that I have with Monk is that the sticker system as a resource is [b][i]functionally irrelevant[/i][/b] when the next correct GCD is always highlighted for you. The development team has stated that \"it was our aim to preserve monk\u2019s playstyle from the Patch 6.x series\". My experience with monk's playstyle in Endwalker was that you had to manage a status effect with each form. Opo-opo, raptor and coeurl form. Every 1.93 seconds you had to make a decision on an enhancement or a spender. That's what Monk's identity was to me. That's why I liked it. That is its essence. It is why it was considered to be so difficult. With the highlighting system that's all gone. What is the point of a form system if there's no choice to be made within the forms? Why engineer a GCD ratio when that ratio is irrelevant? With Monk's current state I can disable the Beast Chakra Gauge from my HUD layout and play the job exactly the same. The HUD serves no critical purpose. This is a design failure. The job's fundamentals no longer synergise with each other. If they truly wish to retain 6.x Monk I firmly believe that Monk's forms [b][i]must[/i][/b] highlight all available GCDs, not just the correct one. The job doesn't function without it. \n\nA closing thought on difficulty; I believe that easy jobs have a place within the game. I personally enjoy dancer, an \"easy\" job. Ultimately I'll accept the direction the developers wish to go but Endwalker added Reaper a pretty streamlined job and Dawntrail added Viper which arguably plays itself with the same action highlighting.  There is room in the game for one or two difficult jobs that offer skill expression purely from the perspective that they are fulfilling to play. It is okay for there to be difficult jobs (not necessarily Monk) that offer a more fulfilling experience through mastery which may not be appealing to your average player. I hope that this trend of simplification of jobs will be balanced when needed with a concentrated dose of complexity.

Die Zonen f\u00fchlen sich nun nicht mehr so leer an. Haupts\u00e4chlich weil man von einem Rand nicht mehr der zweite Rand sieht.

Und wenn es doch einmal an etwas Mangelt, dann gibt es einfach Nebel, der die Weitsicht nimmt und so die mangelnde Gr\u00f6sse kaschiert. Das Erkunden hat mir das erste Mal seit langer Zeit wirklich Spass gemacht, da ich das Gef\u00fchlt hatte \u00fcberall etwas neues entdecken zu k\u00f6nnen. Zugegeben bei den sp\u00e4teren Gebieten wurde etwas mit den Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten gespart, daf\u00fcr sind sie amtosph\u00e4risch fantastisch!\n\nNun die Story. Ich habe viele Leute gesehen, welche die Story nicht abgeholt hat. F\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich hat sie aber genau den Nagel getroffen, welcher ich so gerne in diesem Spiel sehe. Sei es die [spoiler] Besuche bei den Verschiedenen St\u00e4mme in der Azim Steppe [/spoiler] oder auch [spoiler] das Einsammeln der Verschiedenen Artefakte in Il Mheg [/spoiler]. Ich liebe es, wenn wir als Gruppe von einem Stamm oder Volk zum n\u00e4chsten pilgern k\u00f6nnen und so \u00fcber die verschiedenen Kulturen etwas lernen.

Meiner Meinung nach gibt es sehr viel wenige \"Filler Quests\" welche nur da sind, um die Story zu strecken. Aber ich denke, da hat jeder eine andere Ansicht.\n\nFazit: Grafikupdate ist \u00fcberraschend gut gelungen.

The way the story is told and how you progress through the story quests is what it has always been: a circular loop of talking to NPC, doing a boring task, and then talking to another NPC. \n\nDoes it objectively do that loop better compared to other expansions? No. \nDoes it objectively do that loop worse compared to other expansions? No.\n\nDon't let anyone fool you into thinking this expansion specifically has a pacing issue. Literally every expansion has slogs of boring unfun setup quests in the format of mundane chores we call \"\"\"gameplay\"\"\" and this one is no different.\n\n[b]So what about the story? Is that any good? [/b]\n\nFor the most part, yea. While the beginning (roughly up to level ~94) is painfully slow and is reminiscent of the most boring parts of Stormblood, the latter half is a significantly better and will actually make you lean forward to pay attention. \n\n[b]So what about these controversies I hear about all the time? [/b]\n\nThe only legitimate complaint I can see people have is with the character Wuk Lamat. The problem people have is that she is the protagonist of this expansion instead of your own character, which is true. What irks most I feel in terms of character growth is that her story is a retread of Lyse from Stormblood for the first half. The whole moral story of \"I should get to know my people better to be a good ruler\" has been done to death and doesn't bring anything new to the table. \n\nIt's actually insulting to the player's own intelligence that teaching basic moral lessons to Wuk that a 9 year old can understand is the main driving plot up to level 94. I feel that the players that hated her basically tuned out after two quests and just cutscene skipped everything, even though her character does become bearable after the halfway point of this expansion. \n\nThere is no other notable controversy besides Wuk Lamat and even calling that a controversy is a mile-long stretch. Don't let outrage culture and fabricated controversies control your life. This is a video game, rofl.\n\n[b]What about the actual content: skills, bosses, etc?[/b]\n\nEverything is most of the same EXCEPT for bosses. The dungeon and trial bosses I encountered during the main story were more difficult and engaging than any other expansion and it's an amazing change. We're at a point where if you're mindlessly just staring at the floor for circles to dodge, you can, and will get punished for that. If normal content is now this difficult, then the raiding community should be very happy with what's to come.\n\n[b]How does it overall compare to other expansions so far?[/b]\n\nShadowbringers + early Endwalker (up to Zodiark) > Dawntrail > Stormblood >= Heavensward > Rest of Endwalker  >>> Realm Reborn\n\n[b]What would I tell the devs if I could talk to them?[/b]\n\nWhoever keeps keeps adding terrible story gameplay elements such as: stalking NPCs, emoting at NPCs, examining objects in first person mode, playing a realm reborn music, etc, is sabotaging your game.

People complaining about the story are either impatient or lack any sort of media literacy.\n\nThe first half of the story is an enjoyable, lower stakes romp through the nation of Tural with your new best bud shonen protag Wuk Lamat. Some people hate this. Those people are dumb. Wuk Lamat is a very enjoyable character if you understand that the Warrior of Light is something of a mentor to her, or someone she looks up to. In the first half of the DLC rather than being the plucky young hero, you're THE Grizzled Veteran Adventurer. And I think that's a really interesting take for the WoL after the events of Endwalker.\nThe second half, without getting into spoiler territory, surpasses Endwalker in my eyes. The areas, stories, music, duties, literally everything that happens was a delight. Not to mention the far more emotional beats that start appearing near the end of the expansion. Also, the last boss is the best trial in the whole game. With the best theme in the whole game.

If you rush through the MSQ, especially during the first half of the story, it\u2019s easy to think that Wuk Lamat, as a FFXIV character, is insufferable and shallow. But it\u2019s when you take your time with her and understand her perspective that you might gain a sense of witnessing a part of a character\u2019s coming-to story. You aren\u2019t the main character in this expansion but a witness to a character\u2019s journey to finding their identity and as a result becoming someone great. \n2.\n(SOME SPOILERS)\nThe second half of the MSQ involving Solution Nine and Alexandria was something I didn\u2019t expect. They told us that this expansion was sort of a \u201csummer vacation\u201d and I already had my suspicion that it might contain more than what they said, but it surprised me. Krile and Erenville\u2019s side story was great and my favourite part of the MSQ. The reveal of Solution Nine and Queen Sphene\u2019s intention reminded me of Shadowbringer\u2019s MSQ and Emet-Selch\u2019s perspective in that MSQ. Queen Sphene is another character that was conflicted but ultimately chose a path that she can\u2019t go back from. In my opinion her decision wasn\u2019t wrong but it was one that went against what we chose. A character that we understand but have different priorities, similar to Emet-Selch. This \u201cdifferent priority\u201d is what makes a character compelling and why Emet-Selch is so beloved by the community.  Queen Sphene didn\u2019t reach that level but nonetheless she was a great character that I understood and resonated with.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n The whole second half of the MSQ was what made me appreciate the expansion. The MSQ went from a relaxing story that involved a character\u2019s coming-to story to one that involved the tragic end of a character's journey. It was because I chose to take my time with this story that made me understand and appreciate it. I don't think that this is the best MSQ of FFXIV. Shadowbringers and Endwalker are two JRPG stories that I hold special, but this MSQ isn\u2019t a boring one if you appreciate the same things I do. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1720508126, "timestamp_updated": 1720508126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169389691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066342355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This dlc was great dungeons and trials are fun story is good despite what people might lead you to believe can drag on a bit at first when it's world building but gets really good twords the middle and end soundtrack is amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1720505428, "timestamp_updated": 1720505428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169389475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086558955", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "review for Japanese version : yes.\nreview for EN version : no. \n\ndue to IRL culture context and language, this DLC can be perceived very differently depending on what language you are on.\n", "timestamp_created": 1720505124, "timestamp_updated": 1720505124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474478781223297119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169389440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091656092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's great.

But realistically, you haven't been the narrative focus of *any* of the expansions. The story has always primarily emphasized the decisions and emotional development of characters other than yourself.\n\nThe player character taking a position as a mentor along someone else's journey was both very refreshing and very fitting given their strength and wealth of experience. Here you *can't* do everything yourself as the great and mighty hero, because you're not here to squash a problem, you're here to help someone else grow and learn. And then when there's a real threat that needs to be confronted, you *do* step up to the plate.\n\nPersonally I found the narrative main character to be endearing, and her growth over the course of the story was wonderful.

It's clear she can convey emotion, shout, etc., so for the handful of scuffed lines that people obsess over I can only reasonably conclude that the direction given to the actress was lacking (VAs don't get to see the scene and are reliant on what direction they're given to guess at how to read the line. If the director is hasty or omits critical details, you get line reads that don't fit). This has been a problem with their handling of english VA before. (For a funny one see Alphinaud diving into water, but there are other examples as well when you look for lines that just don't quite fit the scene)\n\nThe battle content has also been phenomenal. There's been a clear step-up in the difficulty of normal mode content across the board, with dungeons especially being notably more engaging. Some dungeon fights even have mechanics that previously would have only been in more difficult content (like raids). Not every boss is a hit, but the fights have pretty consistently been at a higher level than they were in past expansions. You can really tell that the encounter design team was allowed to go a little wild here.\n\nIt feels like dungeons are now being properly used as a place to train players on how to do raid mechanics, and while the normal mode trials aren't that much more difficult than they were in the 6.x patch content, they still feel much more \"raid-like\" in a way that's hard to describe.

This includes everything from wearing swimsuits, to clearing your first Ultimate fight, to TENDO SETSUGEKKA, and everything in between.\n\nAnd yet, criticizing it by itself just doesn't feel right to me. You can find plenty of reasons to dislike it on its own.\n\nEndwalker was the conclusion of a 10 year saga. How are you gonna follow up on that, Yoshi P? With tacoes and harmony?

I'm shipping you to Tural for doubting me.[/i]\n\n[h2]Setting the stage[/h2]\nHow do you describe Endwalker, one of the coolest expansions in FF, in a single sentence? Easy. Endwalker is basically the Muv Luv Alternative of FFXIV, where the solutions to its core issues and conflicts are explored in my lovely home of Eorzea. Look up a plot summary if you please.\n\nDawntrail is the \"vacation\" expansion where people say you're the Kakashi or something. I don't care about that. I care about what was shown, filler and everything. And what I was shown something horrible. The relative perspectives of [b]LIFE and DEATH.[/b]\n\n[h2]Spoiler alert[/h2]\nThis review will spoil the entirety of Dawntrail. This a good thing because these spoilers can help those who skipped out on MSQ for gameplay or boredom reasons. This different perspective can help you judge the MSQ.\n\nJust to warn you, these spoilers are going to hurt. If you want to avoid the pain, please feel free to skip as much as you want, including this review.\n\n[h1]Life and death[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]The first one's a freebie and will set the tone. They force this through the MSQ, but people considered this part filler. The Yok Huy have a respectable view on life and death. They honour significant figures by erecting embellished graves in their name. Do note these figures can still be alive and kicking alpacas as they please. They will be remembered so long as the idea of their grave exists.\n[*][spoiler]Sadly, the Mamool Ja are culturally fascist (before you visited them). It's pretty sad because they've lost a conflict and hate where they live. They tell you they want to murder everyone in Tural for their transgressions, but really, they just want to grow things other than bananas and see the sun. It's THAT bad.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Wuk Lamat prefers the harmony that comes from overall cooperation. She presents a spiced taco to Bakool Ja Ja as proof. The Mystic respectfully disagrees and would rather massacre everything for power.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]If it came down to it, Koana WOULD be willing to make sacrifices required for progress. Typical Sharlayan principles :3c When the bandits kidnapped Wuk Lamat, he interrogated bandits at gunpoint. This is a legitimate instance of torture that worked, but will go unnoticed because today's zeitgeist wouldn't recognize it. Especially if Koana failed and actually killed them.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Bakool Ja Ja bears the burden and prejudice of being a 2-headed Mamool Ja. To the Mamool Ja, he's THE messiah that came every 100 years. To everyone else, he's an ass. It's a shame, because he just needed better friends.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]All Zoraal Ja wants is a sense of fulfillment. He wants to surpass his father's peaceful rule with absolute force. Instead of attending the coronation of his siblings, Wuk Lamat and Koana, he enters the Skydeep Cenote and discovers the true secret of the golden city.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]In the end, it turns out the Head of Resolve Gulool Ja Ja, was the wisest of them all. Despite dying a couple years before Dawntrail, he planned out the ENTIRE rite of succession. From the significance of the spiced taco down to the Skydeep Cenote. He vigorously planned everything for somebody who would love Tural as much as he did.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Zoraal Ja invokes an interdimensional merge with his new ally, Sphene of Alexandria. The rift occurs in Yyasulani where a purple barrier is \"erected\". Anyone caught in it unconditionally ages 30 years due to interdimensional japery.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Breaking out of the barrier, Zoraal Ja and his cyberpunk forces invade Tuliyollal. They kill everyone on sight and extract their souls. Zoraal Ja commits patricide with his EW relic VPR weapons.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]In the end, Bakool Ja Ja did what he wanted to do since the very beginning. Utilize his strength to protect his people.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]The people of Heritage Found use Regulators, a technology of Alexandria. This allows citizens to cheat death within reason. This also numbs their relative sense of danger in life.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]When anyone with a regulator dies, they are revived with a soul without memories. The soul they receive is managed and administrated by the government.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]When anyone permanently dies, like of old age, their memories are sent to Everkeep. Everyone else with a regulator will forget them permanently.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]These souls are a resource for war as well. The Arcadia (upcoming raid) was closed during MSQ because Zoraal Ja needed to control Alexandria's soul supply.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]By recycling souls, Alexandrians are more innately resilient to the cycle of life and death. Horrifyingly impressive.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Basically, Sphene needs to kill everybody for her bitcoin mining operations.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Sphene is a queen for her people. Denying her gracefulness would truly be rude.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Her appearance evokes hope. Despite being trapped for 30 years, Turali natives were treated equally and fairly. Even a TURALI VIPER was motivated to spend 30 years serving her! Spoiler alert, the Viper was content with their service.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Sphene also authorized the Tuliyollal invasion. When she was there, she was genuinely sad at the death she caused.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]The Living Memory (golden city) hosts the Endless, Sphene's soul collection.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]The Endless are human souls digitized. It's the zero-waste biproduct from soul processing. Despite ethics, soul processing is... I guess carbon neutral.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]First gen. Endless is transplanting souls into bots. Second generation onwards are a projection of the memories collected. This minor difference is what allowed Otis the bot (and his human soul) to die a normal human death. Otis the Endless simply faded away.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Sphene is also an Endless. Just to remind you, her appearance and personality is reconstructed from how high/low society viewed her. Refer to point # 17.[/spoiler]\n[*]Gundam 00 - [spoiler]Sphene died in the same way Soma Peries died. Her personality was purged from the host. Except Sphene didn't get a weird death montage.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]This one requires an exceptionally keen eye. If you wanted to know where Sphene died, it was when she cried in front of you in the Living Memory. In a blink of an eye.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]In the end, Sphene's personality had been faithfully kept. It's why the Sphene you accompanied also died a human death. You made her feel bad with your delusionally energetic hope.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]This journey was Sphene's Endwalker. She walked to the end and simply couldn't find salvation. We had to kill her. There were no other options.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]The Living Memory is Sphene's bitcoin mining operation. It requires entire planets worth of aether to keep the servers on. We had to turn the servers off and save ourselves.[/spoiler]\n[*]\"Get in the robot Shinji\" =[spoiler]\"You must delete me my fussy little bunbun...\"[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, this trip to Tural was sick!

I didn't like Wuk Lamat. I found her annoying, but more than that she is a weak character who replaces the WOL as the main character. Throughout the DLC, we are to believe that simply touring a few locations and speaking with the locals is enough for Wuk Lamat to grow into the leader her people need her to be, but this is never reflected in the writing, it is simply stated through her monologue-ing. We see evil win throughout the game while Wuk Lamat and our companions BEG for everyone to stop like a bullied child on a playground. Are these the same people who faced the end? WTH? The villains are likewise devoid of any real growth with the exception of one that I can think of. Without spoiling anything, I have to express my shock at the end because I think back to some of the big villains of the past and how even at the end we were able to see their humanity and how poignant and beautiful it was to be able to reach into their world and discover their motivations and what drove them to become the monster that we face, but that is not present here in this DLC. Wuk Lamat is basically saying, \"Let's not uncover or address anything lets just say it's ok that there was so much collateral damage at your hands we can still be besties.\" This was weak and lazy writing. I was also disappointed with the VA for Erenville's mom. Not that she isn't a good VA only that the voice didn't fit. It had a different energy to it that didn't fit into the FFXIV universe. It was a bad choice.

That's all it is.\n\nAnyone this deep into FFXIV whose opinions are worth their weight will tell you that this is the start of the xpac and to already label it as \"the worst xpac ever\" is flat out ridiculous, attention seeking/rage baiting, and they prolly have little else going on in their lives right now.\n\nThe story is just fine, typical for msq. if you don't happen to like the way it's written or the fact that this time the story is not centred around the WOL of the big hero, that's not worthy of a legit critique nor it doesn't mean the game is the worst. For crying out loud it's not even finished! It's just the first dang chapter. The complaints around the MSQ are giving off \"I know I'm watching a romance, I paid for romance but it just sucks cause there's no horror/gore!\" vibes. You're not coming to FFXIV to find a Pulitzer prize or Nobel Prize for literature winning novel here (if you are you 100% took a wrong turn somewhere miles back) so those commenting on it as such really need to get off their high horse.\n\nAll else is similar to any other xpac. The questing system is as it always has been and ever will be. The battle combat is fantastic and fluid. There are wonderful quality of life changes that have been made, class balancing is fine, the new classes are fun and well fleshed out etc. Graphics are better than ever, art style is superb. Music is, as always, godly, voice acting on point etc (And there's just as much as there's always been so complaints around this also don't warrant negative feedback. That's a suggestion to be left to developers.) I've gone on and on about this before in my original review of the game about 5000 hours ago so I will not do it again here.\n\nI've come here to simply say this as it seems to be a common issue:\n\nIgnore the naysayers. Unless they can actually put aside biases (Which can be and are obviously rooted in... certain issues) and critique the game from a mature and professional standpoint then their ignorant opinions (As that's all they are and not legitimate critiques, doesn't matter if they've penned it in pages of word vomit or a single sentence) aren't worth the few grains of salt the tear stains they have from crying so much leave on their face. They're seeking attention. Don't give it to them.\n\nDawntrail is just fine. It's a whole new experience, a whole new story that has just begun and has a promising future.

No spoilers will be said.\nWith the introduction of the graphics changes the game looks and feels a whole lot better. Though queue times at the start of the expansion were bad, it was no where near Endwalker's issues. Some zones even have 6 instances so hunt trains are rejoicing.\nWhen it comes to the story of Dawntrail it simply boils down to if you like **Wuk Lamat**.\nThe Story\nWuk Lamat is the character you'll be assisting to win the rite of succession so she ascends the throne and rules Tural. Issue is, she's worse in every aspect to the other candidates besides her loving heart- her understanding to other cultures and that she can connect to others easily.  Though, even if I have to admit, her character does improve over the course of the story. Since it's a completely new chapter in our WoL's journey the story takes it's time to cook and gets better as the story progresses. But I don't have the patience for Wuk Lamat, I think her voice actor did a great job but was given an annoying role. She is forced with the WoL and needs babysitting constantly and takes up all your attention. A common joke in the ff14 community is \n\"Hey lets split up so we can cover more ground. WoL why don't you come with me\" - Wuk Lamat, every fucking zone.\nOr how everything revolves around speaking to Wuk Lamat and then to Wuk Lamat. And then Wuk Lamat.\nThough side characters who are introduced will catch your appeal and attention, as endearing or even someone who you love to hate. They all fufill a good position in the story. But Wuk lamat has the most screen time so she either feels repetitive to some, annoying to others (me) or you love her and you're happy she's always there. There are a few decisive fan favourites who are rather controversial, either you love them or you hate them. Which is a good mix so all can enjoy the story in one way or another, at least the characters. Bakool Ja Ja for instance (but I don't recommend searching up his fandom on twitter).\nYou are accompanied by the Twins, Alisae and Alphinaud, Krile and Erenville to Tural along side Wuk Lamat. Krile is another person you learn much about, you learn about her grandfather a scholar from Sharlayan and his connections to the New World and the Golden City. The WoL's vacation doesn't only include participating in Mexican Politics but finding this Golden City as a certain friend at the climax of Endwalker coaxes you to find. Which doesn't disappoint, I assure you.\nLast bit about the story. If you are a fan of Xenoblade you will love the latter half of the MSQ. Cause Damn, Yoshi P be sniffing the quality shit when it comes to inspiration.\n__The Gameplay__\nWith the new classes introduced, Viper- The Dual bladed Tweeker and Pictomancer the R34mancer with a horny bonk. The list of Jobs increased from 20 to 22. These additions have been loved by the community as they are both fun and unique classes.\nViper is busy job which is easy to learn but is a bit latency dependant as it requires constant double weaving.\nPictomancer is a high damage mage, with a very unique rotation that doesn't suffer from lack of mobility.\nI have played Viper all expansion and got so attached I am now playing it in extremes and savages, Pictomancer has gotten many caster haters to start playing casters.\nMany classes were reworked but I cannot comment on those since I don't play them.\nThe Dungeons and Trials have been upped in difficulty, every zone has great content- beautiful scenery which was made for the graphics update. The Dungeons are all fun, a surprising addition of difficulty made all the difference. Every boss is surprisingly fun, especially the trials who don't disappoint in extremes. As the game hasn't recieved it's first update yet after the expansion- the raids  have not been added yet. But I can assure you the gameplay is carrying the expansion.\n\nPersonally I love this expansion, the short comings of the story don't stop me from loving playing ff14.

Personally I really Wuk Lamat. She starts off very naive and idealistic, but that is the starting point for her character arc, not the end. If you find yourself getting frustrated with her, have some patience and give her a chance to grow, much like Alphinaud did in Heavensward after being very much hated through ARR.\n\nBeyond Wuk, I found the characters to all be delightful. Gulool Ja Ja, Bakool Ja Ja, and Koana were all great and left me wanting to spend more time with them. I do think Krile and Erenville could have had more focus, but I still very much enjoyed what we got from them. Most of the rest of the Scions took a back seat for this expansion, which might be a bummer to some, but honestly they need to. We've had years to get to know Alisaie and Estinien, let them step aside a bit and let new/less developed characters have room to breathe.\n\nThe music knocks it out of the park, as you would expect. There is one track that sounds like a halfway point between an old disney animated song and gospel music that surprised me, but I didn't hate it.\n\nThe zones are all interesting and colorful, and most end up being split in such a way that it feels like you're getting 10+ zones instead of 6\n\nAs a negative, I do think there could have been more combat encounters, especially early on, which likely contributes to grumbling of the expansion being \"boring\". That said, the combat encounters that *are* on offer are all top-tier, and you can easily tell that CBU3 wanted to push players again after making things somewhat relaxed in Endwalker.\n\nI can't say that Dawntrail reaches the peak of Shadowbringers/Endwalker, but let's be real: we likely won't get something that hits as hard as those did for several expansions, as the team builds up new storylines for us to invest in.

This point is somewhat justified but in my opinion not because of the \"personality\" but rather because the player's character basically was degraded to a traveler companion, almost felt like a NPC.\nThe story itself wasn't bad. The first half had a somewhat jolly mood, felt lighthearted etc. Also it felt a bit predictable but still offered the possibility to different outcomes.\nThe second half of the story was quite unexpected and basically introduced a second storyline which had a darker tone mood-wise. Also the concept the story picked up was a rather complex one in my opinion. Easy enough to understand but leaves enough to ponder about if one is into that thing. Pretty deep stuff in my opinion.\nNevertheless, I can say that I enjoyed the story and the certain NPC wasn't bothering me at all but like I said, the player takes a back seat story-wise (which is okay, can't always be in the spotlight ^^)\n\nOne other point that critics had is the lack of job-changes.\nCompared to Endwalker there have been only minor changes. But that's a point alot of players are glad about it, though. That's a thing that has been discussed for like 50-100 years, now. Some ppl want it to be a game that makes From Software games a laugh, others want it to be a clicker-game. My opinion is, it could be harder and offer more midcore-content instead of catering only hardcore players and casual players.\nJob-wise I think the game does a good job, despite the fact that jobs don't feel that unique like they did a couple of years back.\n\nWhat I liked the most so far are the dungeons.\nThey are beautifully designed and I think the later dungeons have some pretty interesting designs and mechanics that are a little more challenging compared to the casual-stuff we got in the earlier expansions. I hope Square continues this path and makes more interesting dungeons (would also be totally fine if they added 2 difficulties for expert-dungeons or something like that.

Its not entirely without reason, certain flaws with quest design and story pacing are more evident here than they have been in a long time precisely because the format has hardly changed in that time... however, as the first tangible step on the game's new story arc, it had an awful lot to achieve, and for the most part I feel it nails it. The new characters are all fleshed out well, the world-building is excellent and the call backs actually sort of stunned me a bit. Dungeon and Trial design is about as solid as its ever been, and by that I mean its pretty damn stellar!\n\nLike I said, it has issues. Existing characters don't always feel like they have enough to do, some new actors in the EN dub could have been given better direction (my guess is the US actors had a different studio than the one used previously). One character is so omnipresent that if you enjoy her a lot less than I did you might find the whole experience oppressive (for the record, I think shes great). Honestly, the first visit to the fourth zone could have been cut back so that more time could have been spent on the second half...\n\nBut overall, I had a really good time with Dawntrail, and it does make me excited to see where the game goes in the future, and that's the important thing. Is it Shadowbringers or Endwalker? No, and it isn't trying to be.

This is the first story that comes after a long 10 year saga, so I expected it to drag while setting up new locations and cultures and characters - and admittedly, it did do exactly that. The first quarter of the story is fairly tedious, and the pacing of the introduction of the first 3 new towns/cultures coulda used some work. If you read everything and don't skip any scenes, a single quest in the early sections of the story can sometimes take upwards of an hour. It's a little ridiculous tbh. However, once you meet \"The Big Bois\" the pacing of introducing new cultures and areas becomes a lot better, and a lot more interesting too! \n\nBut that's not the main gripe people have with the MSQ. The main gripe people have is with Wuk Lamat - and it's a completely reasonable one to have. Wuk EATS screentime like nobody else. If you don't like her character, or miss her way too subtle growth at the start of the MSQ, you're likely going to be suffering through this expansion. Personally, I'm a Wuk enjoyer. but even I got tired of seeing her all the time. I wish the focus of the story was shared a bit more with Krile / Erenville - or even the twins. Honestly? I kinda hate the twins - especially and mostly Alisaie. But this could've been a chance to do /something/ with them. Instead they are glorified Trust NPCs that stand around and offer minor quips every now and then. I'd rather they not even be there at all if they were just going to do nothing and repeat what everyone else is saying. Also, like all of Alisaie's quips were annoying and boiled down to \"I'm not judging this new culture but.. *judges the culture*\" god i hate her- ANYWAYS\n\nThe second major gripe people have is with the WoL being sidelined in favor of Wuk. Personally, I 100% respect the decision to put the WoL in a mentor-like role (I think the idea of becoming that mysterious adventurer who's Seen Some Shit and just hangs around to give advice / only take care of the BIG problems is pretty badass tbh). I get people have different tastes, but I think this is a good direction for the WoL to go in, especially after Endwalker.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the MSQ after slogging through the first quarter of it.\n\nOk main stuff out of the way; speedrun times!\n\n[u]Zones[/u] - Great! Fun! Lots of cool places to explore even after the MSQ! Wish some of them were actually involved in the MSQ because of how cool they were though!!!\n\n[u]Music[/u] - Slaps! Another great time! Hell yeah more please!!!\n\n[u]Combat[/u] - okay so... I play monk. I've played monk for 90% of my playtime and will likely continue to do so. I do not like current monk. They're reworking monk /yet again/ in the very first patch because they never know what they want to do with this class. I am frustrated,,, but also used to this frustration because it happens every expansion :) Love monk yipee it's a new job every expansion woooooo- \n\nAnyways aside from Monk being dog, Viper is a very simple and boring class to play, but people have already complained enough about how \"busy\"???? it is??????????? so it'll be simplifed even more come the next patch. yay :) can't speak for any other classes cos i don't play them :) \n\nDungeons and Trials were great!!! Some of the fights were surprisingly difficult for MSQ fights! Last trial is PEAK, very good stuff!\n\n\n[u][b]TL;DR[/b][/u] - A serviceable MSQ with some pacing/focus issues, but lots to enjoy if you click with certain characters. Possibly awful experience if you hate certain characters :,) Great Dungeons/Trials. Good Music and Zones as per usual. Generally slow to start, but picks up with time.

With the former I think the Dev team has nailed it and early impressions I'm having the most fun I've had with XIV in a long time. I can see myself regularly logging in to do side activities, harder battle content, and catching up on older stuff I previously ignored because I burnt myself out. \n\n\nOn the flip side the story was kind of a disappointment. Like generally speaking I enjoyed it, but it was definitely flawed and at times felt like a worse re-hashing of certain story beats that have already occurred in Shadowbringers/Endwalker. Wuk Lamat's (our pseudo main protagonist this expansion) characterization was sort of up and down for me and how she was used in the narrative. I don\u2019t have strong negative feelings about her like some people out there and the vitriol she seems to be receiving to me is unjustified. However the way the writers push her onto the audience can sometimes feel overbearing. Ironically compared to some others I enjoyed the first half of the game more than the second story wise. The \"mentorship\" PoV (attempt at it) was actually a nice change of pace honestly, even if held back a bit since the WoL by nature is a silent protagonist (with little discernible input beyond flavor text options unfortunately). Also I did not care for the sh\u014dnen protagonist gags/quirks they pushed hard on Wuk Lamat, weird pacing issues, and the odd tonal shifts. Although I do wish they added more scenes or solo duties where we\u2019re shown training her hands on during the rite or at least have Wuk Lamat's values/beliefs challenged more. And the first half of the expac already dragged on quite a bit therefore I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019d fit that.\n\n\nThen there are other characters that seemed to be highlighted in the trailer that barely got any screentime or plot relevance unless for deus ex machina reasons/trusts/exposition dumps. As well as ancillary characters like Krile and Erenville that are done a bit dirty since they had important roles at least lore wise, but their arcs felt underdeveloped and abrupt when things came to an end. Especially when they had some more emotional moments that I wanted to feel more invested in, but weren't given enough time to fully bloom. For me it felt like certain story beats/plot devices did not get the attention they deserved, while in other circumstances we spent too much time meandering on things that were ultimately inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Which made the pacing feel super rough and FFXIV is known to have stretches even in \"good\" expansions where this is a problem. However in those expansions that we praise they're at worst usually tolerable, or best case scenario a needed breather before the next climax.\n\n\nI think Natsuko Ishikawa has stepped back and the writing team is the one that did \"Myth's of the Realm\" and the \"Zero/Golbez arc\" which shows for better and worse. I'm hoping like gameplay wise with the battle team this expansion that the writing team can get out of their comfort zone and not rely on storytelling conventions XIV has done already or at least repeated a lot recently in the near future. We need a Villain at this point who is just pure evil (Someone we love to hate), and not someone who we're suppose to sympathize with at the end. And I would like more personal stakes for the WoL/Group outside of new characters and places they introduce to us as we go on new adventures. Something that might be controversial to the wider fanbase, but would make the consequences and threats of our adventures feel \"real\" if that makes any sense to keep us on edge. We may need an expansion story wise where we don't \"win\" in the traditional sense and just survive having to live with the aftermath and slowly move forward even if that reality is painful. That could also be a segway into adding another crafting restoration piece of content as well.\n\n\nOnce again though game content and just how it feels to play XIV right now is great. Dungeons/Trials looked awesome and felt like they really tested the player. I was floor tanking a lot more than in the past, and even struggled more than usual with certain mechanics they've implemented. Some of which were remixed in entirely new ways, and some unseen creative mechanics whose variations could add more spice in the future. They seem to be trying to raise the skill floor of the playerbase with the new content which is a good thing overall. Can't speak on the new exploration zone or other stuff we'll get, but it looks super promising. Viper was also awesome, haven't messed with Picto but the consensus I've seen has been very positive with the new jobs and what they bring to the table. Also the graphics update really makes the game pop visually a lot more. It's both subtle, but in other ways very noticeable in the general visual presentation. All while not being that much more demanding in relation to the system requirements. And the new hub towns alongside their tunes are awesome. The only song I wasn't crazy about is \"Smile\" which is the sister theme to \"Open Sky\" the front and center main theme of Dawntrail. It comes off as a super corny late 90s/Early 00s 'direct-to-video' Disney Movie ED song. Although the leitmotifs from it used in other tracks like in the Tuliyollal town themes are nice. Just \"Smile\" itself is kind of grating on the ears, to me at least.\n\n\nI'm rating this as positive mainly because it's fun to play. But the story will leave some people lacking as shown by the mixed response here on Steam and it's understandable. For me this is around the same quality if not arguably just slightly better than base Stormblood narrative wise. However it's a noticeable step down or two from Heavensward, Endwalker, and Shadowbringers' base MSQs. At the very least the world building and expanded lore in DT that the writing team are able to draw upon can add a lot to future expansions. How the various reveals and macguffins in this expac will be eventually used is to be seen. \n\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the team pivots in the patch content and what that may mean for 8.0. Yoshi-P said the reaction of the wider playerbase will sort of dictate how the story will go since they don't plan that far ahead and just pull on open threads to continue the tale until they feel they can move towards a resolution that makes sense like with the Hydaelyn/Zodiark Saga. \n\nEdit: I'm especially excited for the Return to Vana'diel Alliance Raid series, and the exploration zone/field operations when we get to the patches that will introduce those pieces of content.", "timestamp_created": 1720375862, "timestamp_updated": 1724757773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725791990756988525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169261090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066331853", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 272339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "TL;DR: Expans\u00e3o 7/10\nMAPA 8/10: A expans\u00e3o tem uma boa cole\u00e7\u00e3o de mapas. Os iniciais s\u00e3o agraveis, nada muito memor\u00e1vel, mas tem 2 em especial que acertaram em cheio: o mapa de velho oeste/Texas e a cidade Cyberpunk muito bem feita, uma das minhas favoritas. Al\u00e9m disso, a cidade de Tuliyollal \u00e9 muito agrad\u00e1vel, melhor que muitas cidades do jogo, s\u00f3 perdendo para Kugane.\n\nM\u00fasicas 8/10: Este \u00e9 outro ponto que se destaca na expans\u00e3o, com \u00f3timas m\u00fasicas no in\u00edcio e na maioria dos mapas. Tuliyollal \u00e9 incr\u00edvel tanto dia quanto noite. Algumas batalhas t\u00eam \u00f3timas OSTs que tornam as lutas mais \u00e9picas, mas na batalha final, a m\u00fasica deixa a desejar, ficando sem impacto e pouco memor\u00e1vel. N\u00e3o esperava algo como \"Who Brings Shadow\", mas algo mais pr\u00f3ximo de Zeromus. Se tivessem acertado na luta final, talvez a \u00faltima batalha tivesse sido um pouco melhor (duvido).\n\nCombate 9/10: Ambas as classes s\u00e3o bem divertidas \u00e0 primeira vista, Pintomancer \u00e9 divertido e colorido com magias legais de se usar, s\u00f3 precisa de algo que deixe mais flu\u00eddo as pinturas porque pode ser chato ter que renovar e n\u00e3o fazer \"nada\" nesse meio tempo, Viper \u00e9 super r\u00e1pido mas n\u00e3o joguei o suficiente para identificar problemas mas ele e o Pintomancer tem de especial \u00e9 o novo recurso de combinar em um bot\u00e3o habilidades de combos, tornando a gameplay mais fluida e reduzindo a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o do jogador. S\u00f3 n\u00e3o foi um 10 porque isso precisa ser implementado de forma mais ampla nas outras classes. O combo de 1, 2, 3 hoje no jogo j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais vi\u00e1vel. Muitas coisas acontecem na luta e se voc\u00ea pensar em trocar de job para jogar fica relativamente complicado. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o joga com a mesma classe por muito tempo, isso de 1, 2, 3 para combo normal \u00e9 chato e for\u00e7a voc\u00ea a lembrar onde parou caso alguma mecanica aconte\u00e7a e voc\u00ea foque 100% nela. Mas as classes parecem estar bem legais no geral. S\u00f3 upei 4 at\u00e9 agora, ent\u00e3o para ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o completa, s\u00f3 quando todas estiverem no 100, e isso vai levar mais tempo.\n\nHist\u00f3ria 7/10: E aqui come\u00e7a o drama da expans\u00e3o com os reviwers. Com um convite claro e direto de Wuk Lamat, ela nos quer em sua comitiva, para ganhar a sucess\u00e3o ao trono que ela ELA \u00e9 a candidata. Vamos viver uma aventura DELA durante as MSQs, vendo o desenvolvimento DELA. N\u00e3o sei qual a dificuldade dos jogadores em entenderem isso. \u00c9 claro que vai haver um foco maior nela, e isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema, foi dito logo no in\u00edcio. Voc\u00ea aceitou ajuda-la em sua aventura na terra natal Tuliyollal, onde voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma pessoa nova e estranha. Ela vai ter destaque, ela vai nos apresentar as coisas, ela vai nos dar a miss\u00e3o para resolver os problemas. [spoiler]Ela vai ser a contraparte de Sphene quando elas se enfrentarem para mostrar a vis\u00e3o de cada uma na hist\u00f3ria[/spoiler]. E isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 problema.\n\nAgora, falando da hist\u00f3ria em si, acho que a expans\u00e3o come\u00e7ou muito bem, lenta, apresentando tudo e todos com foco nos desafios, que podem ser simples. Sim, \u00e9 uma hist\u00f3ria que j\u00e1 vimos em muitos lugares, mas \u00e9 bem feita e eu adoro essa parte, mesmo quando precisamos parar para conhecer os pares envolvidos e os povos, tem uma boa raz\u00e3o. Isso casa muito bem com o que est\u00e1 sendo contado na MSQ. Acho que os problemas come\u00e7am quando os desafios acabam, l\u00e1 pela MSQ 95, onde a hist\u00f3ria d\u00e1 uma pausa para conhecermos uma nova regi\u00e3o e a\u00ed come\u00e7a uma nova amea\u00e7a.\n\nSphene e seu reino chegam cometendo atrocidades em Tuliyollal e sa\u00edmos de l\u00e1 com um foco muito claro em nossa miss\u00e3o. Quando precisamos parar para conhecer o povo desse novo reino, quebra o clima e a urg\u00eancia de estarmos l\u00e1. Isso se repete n\u00e3o s\u00f3 em Solution Nine, mas tamb\u00e9m em Living Memory. Sei que na \u00faltima cidade tem at\u00e9 dois bons motivos, Krille e Erenville, mas fora eles, o resto fica muito for\u00e7ado na explora\u00e7\u00e3o. Temos algo para fazer e n\u00e3o estamos fazendo por causa de uma mensagem? Ou seria algo que na narrativa japonesa faria mais sentido? N\u00e3o sei se isso \u00e9 um problema, mas a forma como a hist\u00f3ria quer nos passar os motivos e a vis\u00e3o do antagonista \u00e9 bem complicada essa parte. Acho que, nesse final, a narrativa ganha uma gordura extra que deixa o jogo desnecessariamente longo. Digo, em Solution Nine e Living Memory, em ambas as partes a narrativa d\u00e1 uma pausa para nos mostrar um reino novo, com o intuito de nos conectarmos com esse povo ou at\u00e9 fazer uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o com seus costumes e os nossos em Tural(povo gigante) mas n\u00e3o funciona. Me lembra muito os problemas que tinha em toda Endwalker, mas aqui s\u00f3 aparece no final. Queria contar mais por\u00e9m o limite de texto da steam baixo.\n\nA batalha final \u00e9 muito fraca. O motivo \u00e9 meio ego\u00edsta e Wuk a todo momento tenta ver isso como algo bom em algum n\u00edvel, mas ela precisa parar o suposto \"amor pelo povo\" da outra rainha. E o boss \u00e9 muito sem gra\u00e7a, sem carisma algum, s\u00f3 um rob\u00f4 gigante com bra\u00e7os extras, e suas mec\u00e2nicas s\u00e3o igualmente simples. Achei que faltou muita coisa nessa batalha final. At\u00e9 mesmo quando Wuk aparece, o clima n\u00e3o muda, ela nem mesmo faz algo impactante. Um ponto realmente fraco dessa batalha.\n\nSobre Wuk Lamat / Lamaty'i: Ela \u00e9 honesta clara no sentido de ser previs\u00edvel, seu desenvolvimento \u00e9 fraco depois que acaba os desafios quase nulo. Uma personagem que acha que entende o mundo e se acha mais do que realmente \u00e9, e por isso sofre. Com o tempo, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 ela, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00f3s, aprendemos mais sobre a cultura e os motivos que levaram Gulool Ja Ja a ser o grande l\u00edder de Tuliyollal. Ela aprende, cresce, e aos olhos dos roteiristas ela estava pronta para o trono, coisa que n\u00e3o achei. Acho que faltou para Wuk Lamat um trauma mais forte, algo para amadurecer ela e seus pensamentos. Acho que Shadowbringers tinha um tema mais maduro, aqui ficou muito infantil a paz que ela tanto queria alcan\u00e7ar e mesmo quando a guerra chegou em seu pa\u00eds, parece n\u00e3o ter mudado em nada a personagem. Continuou com discurso sobre paz mesmo estando em guerra. Acho que depois do arco da elei\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 onde os problemas com Wuk Lamat come\u00e7am. Ela fica perdida, precisando de temas mais complicados para lidar, mas ela ficou muito passiva com tudo e s\u00f3 queria, proteger seu povo e punir seu irm\u00e3o, mas deu uma pausa para conhecer o povo do novo reino, e sem o mesmo bom motivo que nos levou a conhecer o povo de Tuliyollal no arco da elei\u00e7\u00e3o. Isso me deixou com gosto amargo na boca. Aqui \u00e9 s\u00f3 porque a Lamaty'i queria e n\u00e3o porque tinha uma real necessidade. Mesmo que depois com Krille e Erenville o motivo estivesse bem claro.\nAcho que \u00e9 injusto as cr\u00edticas com ela, at\u00e9 o 95 MSQ ela funciona muito bem, obrigado. Mas no 98 ela s\u00f3 fica a mesma, n\u00e3o piora, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o agrada. Isso n\u00e3o torna a expans\u00e3o ruim de forma alguma, s\u00f3 n\u00e3o faz ela ser lembrada como um Emet-Selch e n\u00e3o vai, mas me parece que o povo que veio de Shadowbringers ficou \u00f3rf\u00e3o depois de sua morte. Mas n\u00e3o posso me entender mais.\n\nVoltando para a hist\u00f3ria, acho que todos os personagens s\u00e3o bem apresentados. Bakool Ja Ja tem um bom aproveitamento, o fato do povo querer e sofrer com a b\u00ean\u00e7\u00e3o das duas cabe\u00e7as e a quantidade de beb\u00eas que morreram no processo \u00e9 bem traum\u00e1tico, coisa que vejam s\u00f3 a Wuk precisava e n\u00e3o teve. Zoraal Ja no final \u00e9 bem triste, n\u00e3o aceitando sua derrota e ficando m\u00e1goa do pai por n\u00e3o deixar nada para ele. Por isso acho que o jogo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 foca em Wuk Lamat, mesmo sendo a hist\u00f3ria dela que estamos acompanhando.\nSempre vai haver os idiotas que v\u00e3o calcular quantas falas tal personagem tem. E isso n\u00e3o significa nada. Dizer que Krille n\u00e3o foi importante em Dawntrail ou que sua hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o foi aproveitada s\u00f3 por causa de x ou y n\u00fameros de falas com a personagem \u00e9 imbecil no m\u00ednimo. Quem jogou e leu sabe que ela teve o tempo necess\u00e1rio sem estender mais do que deveria, coisa que \u00e0s vezes acontece com Wuk Lamat. Vejam s\u00f3 Bakool Ja Ja, Zoraal Ja Krille e Erenville todos s\u00e3o importantes para a hist\u00f3ria, mas o idiota achar que eles n\u00e3o tiveram 50% de falar na MSQ logo \u00e9 s\u00f3 sobre Wuk Lamat, uma pena.\n\nAcho que a expans\u00e3o fez um bom trabalho, n\u00e3o sem precisar reaproveitar nada.", "timestamp_created": 1720375119, "timestamp_updated": 1720375119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518539130687713623", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169260776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072093928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story :)", "timestamp_created": 1720374873, "timestamp_updated": 1720374873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494652390480041504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169260617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970357880", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 393425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1974, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to keep this as spoiler free for Dawntrail as I can.\n\nStory, I'd give about a 7 out of 10.  Not brilliant, but not bad either.\n\nThe story is a bit slower and has a bit more cut-scene than previous.  Just like in Endwalker, if you want more combat during the main story progression, pick up side-quests. The only real difference is some of what would have been 'click the npc to read their chat box' type quests are now 'click the npc to get a cut scene' type quests.  Wuk Lamat seems to be the dividing line between 'I loved the expansion' and 'The story is rubbish'.  Personally, I think she has better development than some characters we've dealt with in the past.  I also broke up the cutscene chains up by doing some sidequests, to get a bit more 'punch things' style gameplay in while working through the MSQ.\n\nThe other big difference is we don't have the whole 'the world is ending if you don't do this now, hurry, hurry, hurry!' sensation driving us forward.  Despite all the complaints, there is only one fewer solo duty than Shadowbringers and Endwalker everyone seems to forget how much the community as a whole complained about a few of those (Ran-jit fight, crawling in the snow solo duty.).\n\nThe story is about half exposition and world building, but picks up pace later on.  It follows, more or less, the same narrative pattern that has been used since Stormblood, just without the fate of the world hanging in the balance from the get go.\n\nCombat Changes: 9/10 \n\nThe dungeons and trials are fresh and challenging.  Even the level 100 dungeons at current answer some of the call for making things more challenging.  SE really seems to have stepped up their game here.  The dungeons feel more mechanically difficult and require more healing to get through then we've been used to.  The trails have new and interesting things that are signs that the raid series is going to be especially interesting this time around.\n\nClasses got tweaked but, for the most part, in a rather subtle way instead of fully redefining them, except Monk (which I haven't played yet, so won't be commenting on.)   The new classes fill interesting niches.  Pictomancer... it's somewhere between Black Mage and Summoner.  There is a lot of heavy casting, but the short cast time vs GCD time keeps it rather mobile with big timed bursts to play around.  Viper feels like the illegitimate love child of reaper and ninja.  It's a rather busy class with the APM of ninja and the tick/tock movement patterns of reaper.\n\nI'd have actually said they knocked it out of the part, and this is the gameplay content I was looking for, except for one of the level 100 dungeons that has a few mechanics no one seems to want to deal with.\n\nGraphics Upgrade:\n\nUnlike 'that other game', when the graphics were overhauled the characters kept their identity.  Skin tones look and are textured better, materials are identifiable.  Viera and Hrothgar still have a lack of hats.  The scenery looks a lot better, even in the old zones.  I'm very pleased with this.  Some people needed to slightly tweak their eye color or darken/lighten their skin tones a bit, but the free fantasia to do just that kind of makes up for it, I think.", "timestamp_created": 1720374759, "timestamp_updated": 1720374759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169259197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114631130", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Not finished as of writing but so far it's good given that it follows the climax of the previous saga.\nThe actual content is great.

It's had mixed reception with some people considering it their favorite expansion and others viewing it as a deescalation from our previous forays. Personally, I found it a refreshing way to kick off a new adventure, and I'm excited to see where it goes next. I'd rank it as my third favorite behind Endwalker and Shadowbringers. Here are some of my highlights and criticisms:\n\nHighlights:\n-The graphic update looks incredible. The game is so beautiful, and it adds to the atmosphere\n-The worldbuilding in this expansion was very comprehensive, and it made me care so much more in the second act of the story.\n-The music, as always, was incredible. It's an old refrain at this point, but Soken and the music team are masters of their craft.\n-The combat design was a step up from past expansions, and I loved the difficulty.\n-The story was fun, and I enjoyed myself while I played\n\nCriticisms:\n-There were parts that I felt were missing voice acting, like when Thancred and Urianger first appeared.

I like how my character looks,  I like the new lighting,  the textures, and all that.   Gorgeous areas,  got a lot better,  I love how the worlds just feels,  of coarse some of the hard light moments  where it needed that black shadows  don't hit as hard,   but overall a good  change.\n\nGameplay:  The classes I played seem very much how they always played.   Of coarse,   the game really wanted to challenge the player this time with some of the mechanics.   This  expansion dungeons and bosses, are far more chaotic making it a Black Mage's  worst nightmare.   but glad they gave us a good difficulty spike.   But still in the end it is kind of formulaic at times and still very  much how you expect from FFXIV,  which can be a bad or a good thing.\n\nStory:  Here is where contriversy comes a lot.  I know they are trying to do a fresh start,   and I know this was going to go it own way other then but overall it is very fun,  but I find it better then Endwalker.    To be fair,  Endwalker  had to wrap up 10 years of story in an Expansion,   but that doesn't mean it wasn't  Dialogue heavy,  with a lot of Dry spots that it left you less engaged.  \n\nDawntrail in my opinion is a bettter paced game,  I didn't find any big dry spells like I did with Stormblood and  Endwalker,  but I found myself at a impasse that it wasn't the best story overall.   The beginning is pretty lighthearted,  a very vacation style story in the beginning and then just ramp up with later half.   While I disagree with how the story played out,  I still say was decent.   I can see why people dislike the first half and I also can see how people displeased with the options at the end,  but I felt content with it.\n\nI think the major thing about this is that,   it is not really your  Characters story.    This story is about  Wuk Lamat,  and even though you are part of it,  it is more of us being the side character unlike the former expansions,    and it just very different.\n\nOverall:  I think it is very much a good expansion,  I won't say it is better in every aspect but I do feel like it was a fair starting point for what ever we may come across later on.", "timestamp_created": 1720370140, "timestamp_updated": 1720370140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169254512", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999024679", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 380732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2014, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed Dawntrail quite thoroughly.

We are in a whole new Story arc now and if we allow ourselves to remember what FFXIV was like 10 years ago in ARR we are laying the foundation for what will be another great story. \nThe pacing does feel slow but the characters are amazing and the game feels like a brand new adventure. SE has done a great job. The new jobs are fun and feel unique.\n\nSo often today we don't let games breath in our never ending quest to chase dopamine. But I urge anyone to take their time with this expansion really let it sink in, don't be quick to judge, we are in this for the long haul.

Even as a BLM I'm enjoying every second of any fight. Even the movement in dungeons or trails are well implemented. The graphics are wonderful and overall bring such a good feeling to the game and it's optimized really well. Lost about 10fps overall with the overhaul and other games with the graphics change I would have lost about 20-30fps most likely. \n\nThe Bad: The story is not a \"End of the World\" type of deal. Some people don't like it. I'm a serial cutscene skipper so it doesn't matter. I watched another player go through it and it was a good vibe overall, well made, stands on its own when the other stories needed to build off the previous expansions to even function as a story.\n\nThey added 2 new classes which are both DPS which leads to an insane queue time for DPS, but, well.

Though it was eventually salvaged into an excellent final product, the initial saga of Final Fantasy XIV got off to a rocky start, only truly finding its stride in the Shadowbringers expansion - so having definitively ended that saga in the previous expansion, Endwalker, the writers finally had the opportunity to start a brand new story from nothing this time around - and they produced a masterpiece. Dawntrail as an expansion was always going to have to provide on three fronts. First and foremost, it had to deliver a more low-stakes, understated plot to provide narrative downtime after the astronomical heights that the previous expansion reached. Second, it paradoxically also had to have high enough stakes to warrant its own existence - with greater difficulty in gameplay content to match. Third, it had to serve as a solid foundation upon which to build FFXIV's next saga. Somehow, despite all odds, I believe Dawntrail delivers upon and surpasses these criteria. The new cast members are instantly loveable, and newcomer Wuk Lamat in particular is both a joy to interact with and the arguable main character of the expansion, whose growth we follow on what might best be described as a road trip across a new continent. A little over half of the expansion is spent following her through slow-paced, but very engaging and comfortable worldbuilding. The continent of Tural, which serves as the expansion's setting, is densely packed and well thought-out featuring interesting map design and even more interesting lore, packed with various cultures inspired by the ancient indigenous South American peoples. Though Dawntrail is lighthearted and fun for the most part, that isn't to say it has no weight to it - on the contrary, the emotional beats in this expansion hit harder than in any expansion prior, with some of the most engaging character writing in the game yet. Having burned through it in little under a week, I give Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail a 9/10, where it takes its place, tied with Shadowbringers as my favourite expansion in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1720364132, "timestamp_updated": 1720364132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169246173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264479607", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "To sum up my feelings in one line so you don't need to read further if you don't want to: Dawntrail might be my personal favorite expansion (on release), but it might not be for everyone.\n\nBattle Content, Job Balance, & Gathering/Crafting:\nThe job changes and adjustments to the pacing of dungeons, trials, and high-end content has made the game feel more frenetic and tense than ever. Dawntrail is entirely willing to frequently flood your screen with layers and layers of AOE markers to keep you moving and on your toes, a welcome change from the frequently stagnant dungeon bosses of Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The trials are inventive and climactic, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to the raid content after trudging through the dreaded Party Finder for the extremes. \nJob balance itself needs a hand, as things seem lopsided at the moment. But as always, expansion launches are hardly where the meta will settle. There is very little I, as a veteran of four expansion since late Heavensward, can say as to where one might find issues in their current design philosophy regarding jobs and their balance. While I would adore some of Stormblood's more janky rotations to make a comeback, I have to recognize that such a change would be to the game's detriment.\nAs to crafting and gathering, you'll find the experience much the same as previous expansions. Hand/Land jobs are still leveled primarily through leves. There are still master recipes. There are still tomes of folklore. Nothing here has surprised me, but it has given me a chance to - as always - truly explore the areas the expansion released.\n\nNarrative & World - Spoiler Free:\nThis expac's MSQ is, perhaps, the one I've most enjoyed on release. Shadowbringers and Endwalker were extremely good experiences, which played on grand scales of world-class threats. They were melodramas that reveled in existential themes and grand stakes. Dawntrail is not that kind of story. In it, the Warrior of Light takes on the role of the weathered, experienced mentor to the young and unsteady Wuk Lamat. Though some players might miss being in the spotlight, I thoroughly enjoyed watching her journey from the sideline and getting to see how we impacted her. Several of the characters in Dawntrail's narrative left me hungry for more scenes and content that revolves around them, instead of us. I do wish we would further divorce the narrative from the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, some of whom are present for this journey, but I suppose seeing old favorites return is never wholly bad. The tone can be a lot lighter than the previous several expansions, but supposing you're willing to lean back and enjoy some campy dialogue here or there it's a good time. I never felt as though the narrative wasn't taking itself seriously, even if I did laugh at one or two moments.\n\nIn regards to the expansion's new locations as a place to inhabit and live within throughout your journey, few places in Etheirys have left me quite so enthralled as Tural. Its jungles, mountains, and swamps - loaded with perfect vistas and awesome monsters - have lived rent-free in my head since the early-access period. Few regions in FFXIV have gotten stuck in my head quite like all of the zones in Dawntrail have. The graphical update was plainly utilized in every fiber of this expansion, and few moments from earlier expansions have left me quite as breathless from the beauty of what I was looking at.\n\nAt the end of my journey on release, I found myself despserately wanting more. I want to see more of the characters we met here in Tural, and hope that Square and CBU3 iterate on what they set the groundwork for here. By the end of our initial step into the MSQ, it truly feels like we could go from here to anywhere.

While it doesn't hit the peaks of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, it definitely did enough for me to feel like it was a worthy successor, and is a reassuring first step into FFXIV's new saga.\n\nTL;DR: Very good, but dialogue heavy, and a new character is the main focus, meaning that not liking her may tarnish your DT enjoyment as well.\n\nThe main things to be aware of are that the narrative shifts away from our Warrior of Light as the main character, and instead passes the spotlight to the third promise, Wuk Lamat. Our character instead takes on the role of her mentor and enforcer (when necessary). As a result, your overall enjoyment of the story hinges entirely on whether or not you like Wuk Lamat. In my opinion, she was a very enjoyable character with well-written growth and development. \n\nThe other element to be aware of is the pacing of the story & gameplay. In Stormblood, there was a solo duty very early on into the experience, which caused major issued at launch due to the servers for maintaining the single player instances getting completely full, resulting in players being unable to continue the MSQ. Because of this, the team takes more precautions in designing the early game to avoid similar issues. As you're exploring your first two leveling zones, you will not be getting involved in any major scuffles to test your mettle. Combine that with the first two zones being very exposition heavy due to the narrative involving learning about the cultures and people of Tural, and you will be jonesing to get into a real fight in-game.\n\nOnce you get past that hurdle, things improve significantly, though I think being unaware of the circumstances and the slow pacing can definitely leave a bad first impression. This expansion is a little more cutscene heavy than the previous ones, or at least it feels that way. The game would've benefited a lot from one or two more solo duties sprinkled throughout. That said, the combat in dungeons and trials is A+ and when it comes to the story, once the ball gets rolling, it's hard to stop it, especially at the end. There's a lot of intrigue propping up the second half of the Dawntrail experience that kept me hooked and playing as long as I could to keep experiencing what's next, and I can safely say that our fun little adventure for adventure's sake ends up escalating into a grand journey with a threat suiting the Warrior of Light that went to the edge of existence.", "timestamp_created": 1720340296, "timestamp_updated": 1720340296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169215593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819789428", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "i liked dawntrail! a lot actually! it is not a bad expansion, i'd even say it's a great one. (obviously not as good as shadowbringers or endwalker, but those are like my favorite games of all time (if my meteion pfp didnt tell you already)) i just think it's not everyone's cup of tea.\n\n i'm admittedly a new player, who started less than a year ago and this is my first expansion drop, but i had so much fun with this! but there are a few things that i do feel like need to be said.\n\npsa! this is all my opinion! i wrote this at 1 am on a whim because i felt like dt was getting a lot of flack mostly for being not as good as shb/ew, which i think is mostly unwarranted because dt is really its own thing and the start of a new storyline. that is, again, my opinion. you are welcome to disagree with everything i say (just dont be mean about it) but now on to the actual review :)\n\nsome people have said this already, but your enjoyment can really be boiled down to two things:\n1) do you like wuk lamat?\n2) are you okay with sitting through several cutscenes in a row?\n\nif your answer to one is no, then you will not like dawntrail. dawntrail is wuk lamat's expansion, it's her journey to becoming a fitting dawnservant and it very VERY heavily focuses on her, her actions and interactions etc. if you find her annoying, you wont like the story because 90% if not more of the cutscenes have wuk lamat in them. on top of that, the wol and the scions take a back seat this expansion. and by back seat, i mean wuk lamat and erenville are in the pilot seat, the wol and krile are in economy, and everyone else is in the baggage compartment. i love the scions, dont get me wrong, but besides krile, they've all had their times to shine and develop. them taking the backseat allows for the new characters this expansion to get the development that, if the scions had been more prominent, i dont think they would have gotten. i do wish there was a bit more of them, but im also glad they gave room for the new characters to shine.\n\nif the answer to two is no, then you'll find this expansion boring and wanting for more fights and content. thats not to say the fights are bad, on the contrary the trials (ESPECIALLY the last two) are some of the best that ffxiv has ever come out with, and have some absolute BANGERS for the osts. what combat there is in dawntrail is extremely fun and amazing to play with some really cool mechanics. you have to wait a WHILE between them though, and there were only 3-4 solo duties through the whole expansion. so if you're here for the fights and mostly/only the fights, you'll also find dawntrail lacking.\n\ni happen to both like wuk lamat and be okay with just sitting and watching cutscenes for a while. i also went through the entire thing from start to finish with a friend which always helps. but dawntrail is by no means bad. it has some rough patches, but every expansion does. (though its post patch, the mayoral election between your two big final ascian fights is a little weird, and to me all of the stuff with getting the forums permission in endwalker was really annoying, especially with how fourchenault treated the twins)\n\n\nbeing built for the new lighting engine, dawntrail looks absolutely stunning. tuliyollal is by far my favorite city now since it actually feels lived in compared to the others, in my opinion. yak tel was stunning, especially the lower half. shaaloani and its wild west misadventures was also fun little side romp between the two major arcs of the story! on top of that, the final area is absolutely stunning the first time you visit. nothing is ever going to top ultima thule/the tempest as a final area, but they did pretty damn good all things considered.\n\nlike i said earlier, dawntrail is not for everyone. i adore this expansion and its characters though, and IF the msq really turns you off, i think you should at least try and play through all the expansion because i do think the fights are worth it. maybe wait for the raids to release/the eden ultimate release to be officially announced so you have more bang for your buck when you do actually buy it. and if you don't want to do all of that, then that's fine. \n\none last thing before i go:\ni'm BEGGING you, if you do nothing else PLEASE listen to the final trials theme because it is one of the best in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1720339982, "timestamp_updated": 1720339982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169212973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094380789", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "\"After 9 years of playing this game, with the story finally concluded, here's my take on Dawntrail:\n\nDawntrail is truly a remarkable expansion, as they promised.\n\nStory: I'd rate it 5/10 for the first half and 8/10 for the second. The latter part was particularly engaging, but the overemphasis on Wuk Lamaty felt excessive. While I appreciate her character, I wished the latter half focused more on the Warrior of Light and the Scions. I felt sidelined, despite saving the very stars at the end of the universe. More involvement would have been gratifying.\n\nMap Design: An absolute 10/10. The maps are breathtakingly beautiful, undoubtedly the best aspect of the expansion for me. The map design is where Dawntrail truly shines. It sets a new standard for the expansion's launch content.\n\nBattle Design and Content: I give it a solid 9/10. However, as a healer, the inability to withstand a single damaging skill is frustrating beyond belief!\n\nThe latter part of the story left me eagerly anticipating what's next. The narrative took a compelling turn, leaving me hungry for more.\n\nThe battle content continues to improve and excite. The two new classes, Pictomancer and Viper, are my absolute favorites. I give them both a perfect 10/10, though I'm baffled by the absence of poisons in the Viper's arsenal.\n\nIn conclusion, although the second half of the story could have been more focused and the first less, Dawntrail is undeniably a hit.

Some jobs (MNK, BLM etc) that had optimised rotations have had their skill ceilings dulled down while not actually making the job any easier to pick up, leading to a more shallow job overall where players who had skill expression previously have been punished while not actually helping newer players.\n\nMost other jobs have not changed much apart from just having one big button added, and some QoL added. In saying that, square enix has stated that this is due to the fact that they are making a significant shift in content difficulty (which can be seen as present), and did not want to overwhelm the player base with \"too much new stuff\".\n\nHaving to wait potentially 3 years for some semblance of individuality in jobs leaves a sour taste in my mouth and I can only hope Square enix attempts to expand on jobs during this expansion rather than waiting.", "timestamp_created": 1720329806, "timestamp_updated": 1720329806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169205370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067102854", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed it", "timestamp_created": 1720328275, "timestamp_updated": 1720328275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169205262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048011151", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly believe this is the best expansion they released to so far, but it can not be the same for everyone.\n\nIt relies HEAVILY on weither you like Wuk Lamat or not.

I enjoy this expansion up to this point.\n\nThe start is a bit slow but I think the thing to remember is that we just got off of the high of a pretty heavy expansion. It'd be like if ARR started with Heavensward. It wouldn't have the same weight it did because we don't have any personal connection to the npcs. We are building connections for the future and while I haven't fully finished the MSQ the part that people have mainly complained about I have gotten past.\n\nI'll give a few good and bad points with some neutral ones as well so an informed decision can be made for future buyers.\n\nPros \n- The graphical update that came from this expansion was heavily needed and has made the game look fantastic in comparison to before.\n- The actual encounter design has improved significantly. The fights are a good difficulty and reflect the likely hundreds of hours someone who is playing this expansion might have.\n- The new areas themselves look gorgeous and are something that I actually wanted to explore in comparison to areas in Stormblood and Heavensward. They added multiple fast travel points between the area in the zone so it isn't like the Heavensward area that has only 1 teleport at the bottom and the area is gigantic. \n- The 2 new jobs are some of my favorite to play, with Pictomancer being the job I am planning on raiding with and doing the future ultimates on.\n\nNeutral\n- The story is not as focused on your character and instead focuses more on Wuk Lamat, a character new to this expansion who your character is helping. While I enjoy this aspect of the expansion I could see where someone wants the more self focused expansions of Heavensward/Shadowbringers/Endwalker.\n- The job gameplay for the non new jobs is mostly the same besides the reworked jobs. If you already liked a job you'll have more of what you like,  if you don't like a job you will have more you don't like. A personal gripe here is Summoner not having any complexity added to their pretty simple rotation, but it is a beginner friendly job due to this.\n\nCons\n- The questing formula for MSQ is still the same as in previous expansions. If you know the standard when you get a dungeon, when you get a trial, when you get to a new area you already know what you're expecting in timing. \n- Along with the previous point, quest design has not changed much. You still have the talk to npc, talk to another npc, talk to another npc quests.

I can't understand the backlash that's been given to this Xpac for \"lazy writing\". Our character arc after Endwalker is reset to stage 1; we're just adventurers again. The story following Wuk Lamat isn't as bad as people say, we're just the mentor this time around and honestly it's not that bad. After doing a world ending apocalypse I feel that our character is justified to just sit back and relax after those events, we don't need constant one-upping-stakes to make the game feel good. You know what game did that and crashed horribly before they reset with their latest Expansion? World of Warcraft. Most of these bad reviewers probably have never played any other MMO and can't fully comprehend that to start a new expansion saga, we need to start slow and establish an opening. Now for people saying it's boring for 70% of it, I'm going to be dead honest, it's not. We are told to help the next successor, not BE the successor. Why would we interfere with that? it's not always going to be about us. I think people refusing to let the connecting societies of Tural share their lore and world building are the same ones that get mad when a story doesn't have any lore at all or it feels \"artificial\". If you got rid of those building blocks, Tural would just be one giant copy paste of a continent. The characters are written well and I'm starting to assume most people have a terrible outlook on life to want edginess and depression in every character.

It's not going to be bombastic like Endwalker since that was the end of a saga. The characters they are building have so much more room for growing. Take the original scions for instance, they were just boring people when we first met them; and they drastically changed in Heavensward.

I'm looking forward to the standard raids and hope they stay challenging.\n\nI enjoyed the story, characters and your WoL's place in it. A poor analogy I keep using is that it's like the Knives Out movies - like Benoit Blanc, you aren't the \"main\" character in this story, you're a mentor helping someone else along their journey while fighting off or outsmarting bad guys that would otherwise just kill your new friends immediately. I find it a neat way of framing your WoL's legend and experience. \n\nWhere the story started to nag me is that [i] so much time [/i] goes to Wuk Lamat. While I like her character, so many other characters could have used an extra cutscene or two to explain their thoughts or conflicts. It's a small gripe that gradually built up over the story for me and by the end, I was really disappointed in how little other characters got time in the spotlight. Hopefully this nitpick can be made redundant in the 7.x story if they decide to revisit some characters and places.\n\nOverall still an enjoyable Main Scenario Quest, especially towards the second half. \nIt's a great mechanical update for the game and I'll be staying subbed for what comes next for FFXIV.", "timestamp_created": 1720293918, "timestamp_updated": 1720294043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169171975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135406321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "A heartwarming tale of a new peoples' cultures, revelations of the world that further expand the potential of the game's storyline (even after more than 10 years!), and improvement of battle and non-combat gameplay that astonishes even the most frequent players.

Some may hate the jazzy theme of Tuliyolal but I always find myself bopping to it.\n\nThe combat encounters? Now this is one of the spots where the entire expansion shines. I found myself caught off guard and surprised by trials that were *gasp* actually a challenge with mechanics and telegraphs that were unique and inventive. Even the dungeon bosses proved a challenge at times at minimum ilvl. They killed it here.\n\nVisually the expansion is a feast for the eyes. Characters look great and full of life.

The expansion excelled in everything not only story wise but locations, music and trials/dungeons. I love how challenging the new stuff is and the music was incredible. Loving all these locations too. Wuk Lamat's story is very touching and I feel that the \"boring\" 50% of the MSQ people are talking about was literally the foundation building for this story and is world building, learning about the different peoples and cultures and where Wuk Lamat comes from and who she is. It's also nice for a change that the WOL isn't the absolute centerpiece of an expansion seeing as we had that for the past 10 years.

Story-wise, things start slow, then start to amp up about a third of the way through, then by the second story arc of the expansion, the stakes increase and things really get interesting. Overall, story-wise I'd say it's sitting somewhere around the 7.5 - 8/10 range. Keep in mind that your character takes on more of a mentor role in this expansion to the newly introduced Wuk Lamat. This character develops throughout the expansion, from essentially a naive and sheltered child into a confident and capable leader. She is for all intents and purposes the true protagonist of most of this expansion, and if you're not a fan of her, you probably aren't going to enjoy the story this time around.\n\nEncounter design (at least for normal content, I haven't done the currently released Extremes yet, and as of this review the raids have not launched yet) is better than it's ever been, dungeons are a bit more challening this time around so they're not too much of a snoozefest.\n\nThe new jobs are fun. I haven't played much Pictomancer, but Viper is possibly my favorite job to date. If you like a simple rotation that doesn't make you think very much, but one that also feels rewarding to play due to the sheer APM built into its rotation, it's the job for you.\n\nThe new zones, and visuals in general are gorgeous. The graphics update that released with the expansion makes the world look so much more alive than ever before. That's not to say that it's necessarily up to modern standards, but they manage to still make this game look great despite its age.\n\nThe soundtrack starts off on the weaker side in my opinion, but once you get into the second arc of the expansion, it's some of the best we've heard. I hated the end credits music though.\n\nThe launch has also gone incredibly smoothly, especially when compared to the launch of the previous expansion, despite having an even larger playercount this time around.\n\nAll in all, at this early state in Dawntrail's lifespan, I'd give it a solid 8.5 or 9/10 overall.

The game's first major story arc across 5 expansions has concluded, and I would say it's one of the best stories in video games and one of my favorite stories in any media with hundreds of excellent dungeons, trials, and raids to play - all of which are still actively run by the game's player base. It's 1000s of hours of high-quality entertainment, and I unreservedly recommend it.\n\nSadly, the game's *second* major story arc is off to a rough start. \n\nThe problem is not really with any single character or plot beat - the problem is the PACING of the entire expansion. About 20% of the expansion's main storyline involves combat - duties, dungeons, trials, all the rest. These encounters are some of the best I've seen in the game, and are absolutely a blast to play over and over again. Unfortunately, story is the other 80% of the game. You will walk to an area, see a cutscene (or 2, or 3), walk to a different area, see another cutscene (or 2, or 3) and keep doing this. There are entire levels from 90-100 where you don't have to attack a single monster - you get enough XP from the story to do this. \n\nPrevious expansions have all had very significant story components - this is a game that loves its narration. But in prior expansions, the mix of combat and narrative was better, and the story was far more epic. Dawntrail specifically tries to take a step down with its story and deliver a de-escalation, where you're more of a mentor figure to other NPCs learning how to make their way in the world. And that's cool from a narrative perspective, but makes the game really, really boring to play through for those 30 hours of pure narrative - much of which is characters repeating what you already know or figured out. \n\nAs an example, there is a very cool moral question the game brings up towards the end of the expansion... but it chooses to do so when you're about to stop the expansion's final boss from doing Really Bad Things. So you literally walk away from the door to the final boss, explore an area with no real combat, and go into 2+ hours of narrative filled with cutscenes doing their best to tug at your emotions. Fair enough, I suppose... but I wanted to go deal with the boss that the game told be was about to do the Really Bad Things, and now I'm delayed from doing that - or anything resembling gameplay - for HOURS. It's not the plot that's the problem, it's the pacing.\n\nSo, why do I give Dawntrail a thumbs up? Because now that I've finished the main story, everything is fun again. The graphics update makes the world come to life, the music is awesome, the new encounters are top tier for any MMO, new classes are fun (and every classes' new features from 90-100 are fun as well), and there's a ton to see and do. The sidequests don't really suffer from the same problem the main storyline does, and I've enjoyed leveling up my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes way more than my 1st class. Dawntrail does everything you love about FFXIV better than it's ever been done, except the story is the most boring it's ever been.\n\nI do recommend Dawntrail, just know what you're getting into.", "timestamp_created": 1720242216, "timestamp_updated": 1720242216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169116249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066249737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good", "timestamp_created": 1720241906, "timestamp_updated": 1720241906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169114892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035718186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "People are crazy rating an entire MMO expansion bad because of heavy exposition in the story.

The areas we journey through are some of the most vibrant, lush, and interesting areas we have in the game. The new lightning engine really delivers those areas nicely.

The music is also wonderful and thematic (in places - there's one place where the music choice threw me off rather than immersed me into the setting) and I enjoyed learning about the culture and the new people in Tural. The new dungeons and trials are also quite challenging, but fun.\n\nHowever...  (spoilers ahead)\n\nThe writing is definitely subpar in some circumstances. Certain themes are repeated so often and with the subtlety of a brick being thrown in your face to the point that even cutscene skippers are well aware of them. I think many of the complaints of Wuk Lamat being annoying is not because of her personality, but because how every time she gets an opportunity,  she talks about protecting the hopes and dreams of her people. This theme gets forced into conversation at the merest hint of any opportunity.\n\nWorse I think is the portrayal of Sphene. It's emphasized again at every opportunity how much she's supposed to be a good person and how much her people love her because she has the same values as Wuk Lamat.

A breath of much needed fresh air yet still managing to hit my emotions like a bus.\"\n\nSkip to the bottom if you just want a TLDR\n\n\n\nI will first briefly discuss combat. As someone who has completed all five ultimates, I feel the combat in this expansion is wonderful and can provide several new avenues for new ideas. From the first dungeon to the new extremes, things felt fresh and my opinion was very positive on it all.\n\nAs I had written previously, this story is much needed fresh air as opposed to what we had initially. I feel the formula of \"OH NO! There's a big bad that will end the world and ONLY YOU can stop it!\" would get old incredibly fast. We had this formula for two expansions in a row and I feel if it were the same for this one my interest in the story would die incredibly fast.\n\nWhy I love this story as much as I do is it tells a story from a whole new perspective. We come to Tural as guests and that is our role. We are only there to help Wuk Lamat win the contest. So in other words, our character serves as more of a mentor role to help new faces grow into strong roles. Some of my friends have argued with me that even at the end of Wuk's story line that she is undeserving and has shown no growth, I feel the opposite of such sentiment but understand it but thats an entire rant in itself. Regardless, having our character take the passenger seat rather than be the driver at least to me felt incredibly needed for this game's story to remain healthy and not tired.\n\nAs for the later half, my sentiments remain in line with most other people I talk to about this story. It is incredibly good. Without getting into specifics, I had lost several close family members right before this expansion had come out and the story had managed to make me relive my sorrow for each of those losses. I think a good story is always great when it manages to make me feel actual emotion rather than just be a robot shrugging off an entire story as \"eh\"\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\u2022 The combat is great and not sleep inducing as opposed to previous expansions.\n\n\u2022 The story is a much needed reprieve from what I was starting to dislike about the Hydealyn trilogy\n\n\u2022 To me this expansion has a lot to work with as we enter a new saga of stories to tell the players and has me eagerly looking forward to the future of the game I fell in love with.\n\n\u2022 If people wanna give this more clown awards thank you in advance for the free steam points!", "timestamp_created": 1720222860, "timestamp_updated": 1720918645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521552026271820068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169093340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012512212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The first half of the story could have hit the same story notes while being a bit shorter, but second half was right back to the excellent story telling we are used to.

If you don't like Wuk Lamat fine, not a reason to leave a negative review. If you don't like being the MC fine, even though we knew going into this we would be taking a backseat in the story. But if the narrative of  Wuk Lamat and not being the MC is reason enough for you to leave a negative review you are being unfair to these devs. This is on par with the other xpacs, especially if you are aware of the story to any degree. We laid a foundation and had an amazing adventure across a base game and 4 xpacs. That story is done, it has concluded, to tell another story we have to lay a foundation again, and here it is. If your media literacy is this poor then FFXIV was never a game for you. Anyone who has sunk the time needed to finish the story to this point understood what was next for us and this was a good way to do it imo. I expect the review score to shift once the playerbase that was waiting to finish the xpac before reviewing leaves their's, as almost all of the negative reviews weren't even half way in when they posted. This and the Elden Ring response has me genuinely upset with the gaming community at the moment. We have AAA games pushing live service, mtx, and god knows what else and they get half this backlash for doing things actually worth calling out. Do better.\n\nEDIT; Reading more of the negative reviews to try and give them the benefit of the doubt, the only things I can agree on are the need for a neutral button or more nuance than a thumbs up or thumbs down. That said I'm seeing a lot of reviews that outright lie about parts of the story that they wanted and are claiming aren't there. Or details they wanted from certain characters or responses that they didn't get. But I can more often than not point to a moment in the xpac or multiple that check the boxes they are claiming were left unchecked. A lot of these people started skipping cutscenes and admit to it in their review. I get it, you people wanted this low stakes, vacation after the adventure of a lifetime to somehow be a bigger journey than the base game and 4 xpacs we did before it. Like, you somehow wanted the story to go up in quality from Shadowbringers and Endwalker which is just not possible when we are just starting again. It's not a perfect story, for sure, but to review bomb the dlc cause you didn't like this msq is a bit much considering this is only half the story and we have patches of msq to come as we always do. Wuk Lamat is stuck in Tuliyolal, she's not leaving to join the Scions, she can't hurt you any more. I get if you want to rate this lower than other xpacs cause of how you feel about the msq but every xpac gets some level of complaints from some part of the msq that just bored them to death. If you actually played and read the whole damn story from level 1 to level 100, you are perfectly fine with this one. That said, we need more nuance for reviews. Some people will have one moment of cringe in the msq and discount the entire xpac, some love the whole xpac and have small complaints and still give a negative review. It's honestly been a mess.\n\nEDIT 2; First wing of the new raid is out and the content including the story continues to be top tier.", "timestamp_created": 1720213811, "timestamp_updated": 1721313231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464625149965286255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169088217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032949453", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 577747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 432, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's make one thing clear: This expansion was never meant to match Endwalker, let alone Shadowbringers.

Let's explore some more!\" arc, and it did that in spades. There was more character growth in this expansion than in any prior one, and it was all while our WoL took a backseat to play advisor/mentor and help foster these growths.

She was a well-written character that, admittedly, did take up a lot of the story. She has a massive amount of lines (compared to other characters) but she's fun enough to be with that that's not that big of a problem. For the love of Christ though please play in JP voices, it's better overall and for whatever reason the EN VA for Wuk is petty awful. Honestly, if you're playing JRPGs you should be playing with the JP VAs anyway. I'm personally convinced that most people that hate her only play with English voices.\n\nFor the rest:\n\nThe story is pretty good overall. I think it ended somewhat weakly. No spoilers, but it felt like there could be more to it, but I suppose that's what the patches are for.\n\nThe rest of the story was fun though, it felt like a good journey from beginning to end. It was fun learning about the different cultures and zones of the new area. Going through it with Wuk along the way did add to that as well. It felt like a journey of growth. It was much less impactful than Endwalker but that's by design - in Endwalker it was the cumulation of a decade long storyline, this is something completely new. One thing they could improve on is more variety in quests though, much of it is fetch and go talk to this character. Honestly though, the people that complain about the story and its structure probably should just not play JRPGs. XIV is just that at its core - a JRPG. It just also happens to be an MMO.\n\nThe new zones are wonderful, with the exception of the very last one. It's great to start with, but it very quickly loses its luster, which is a damn shame. The new cities, especially Solution 9, are pretty good too. Solution 9 alone steals the show, but again, it's missing a few small things that would really take it to the next level. There's no inn there, there's plenty of little things that just aren't there (novelty vendors, etc.) that would really make the city feel more alive and fun. I don't really like comparing XIV to WoW, but this is a good example, in Stormwind (or any other major city) in WoW there are plenty of little vendors that aren't connected to anything major, they don't sell your next set of gear, they just have random garbage, maybe food, toys, whatever. They're there for world building. XIV could learn from this, especially with how big of an RP community XIV has.\n\nThe jobs (new and changes to old) is a mixed bag. I personally only play 3 jobs (DNC, SGE and GNB) and i'm satisfied with how all 3 of them work in this expac, I think there could have been more added but overall it's not bad. I've heard less good things from other classes, especially summoner, but I can't personally say much about it. Again, I hate comparing to WoW, but having more variety and customization in jobs (e.g. talents) would go a long way to making them more interesting to play. On the other hand, the new gear sets so far look great.\n\nThe new dungeons are a lot of fun, they did a great job with them. Not a lot to say about them really, but the last 3 (minus the post MSQ ones) were really the best of the expac.\n\nI'll probably add more to this as i think of it (and when the raids come), but for the most part this is a solid expac.

Do not go into this expecting a continuation of Endwalker, that is not what this is. This is a geopolitical world building focused story like ARR (though much better told than ARR overall). If you have an open mind for cultures, love fantasy world building, or just like political plotlines with some fun characters then you'll like this one. If you don't care about that and just want a simple, fast paced story with lots of epic fights... this is not for you. \nNew Character writing starts simple but grows over the duration of the game, Wuk Lamat in particular feels kinda grating at first but has multiple major growing arcs as the story progresses. A reveal around level 92 of the story really works to enlighten you on why that is, but by the end it makes sense why she is the main character of this story. (Hint: Social person who cares about the people tends to be a better political leader, shocker.) The king of Tural is easily one of the best new characters ever introduced, with lots of depth and emotion. Voice Acting is excellent for the most part, with some of the weaker voices mostly coming from new voice actors getting into the industry, but you can tell they are really trying their best and their performances definitely improve as the story proceeds on. I expect them to continually improve over time with more practice. And to note, the accents of the Turali people are not an easy thing to replicate, the fact that the accent was as consistent as it was is a sign of some very good voice direction. Respect there.\nMy biggest complaints come to some design decisions with jobs, specifically Viper and Black Mage. Viper is really simple in it's current form, without much variety in it's moveset and a serious lack of custimizability in it's button layouts. (Something they fixed for most other classes by allowing you to split buttons apart that otherwise would share a slot). Black Mage has been made horrible to play at any content below level 90 with mana regen and dot applicaitons being way harder to maintain without some of the higher level abilities.

So forgive me if it's a bit all jumbled.\n\nBut I'm going to make an exception this time around just to say that Dawntrail is a fantastic reset to pick up on after our WoL's adventures in the Hydaelyn/Zodiark arc. I understand some slight criticisms in regards to a bit of pacing here or there. Or perhaps a few quests that maybe could've been optimized a bit more in how we complete them (such as talking to the same NPC back to back with nothing in between), but most of the reviews I glanced through just didn't warrant reading.\n\nIt's no Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but if you were going into this expecting that then you weren't paying attention to the marketing. Comparing the start of a new arc to the culmination/climax/finale of a previous arc just doesn't make sense. There's a lot of world building done that both introduces things that are new and things that build on concepts we're already familiar with (won't spoil). The themes that DT played with were really heavy towards the end, the beginning being this sort of coming of age story that we're in the role of a mentor, and the stakes were definitely raised high. This has set the stage for some crazy things in the future and I'm here for it. \n\nI'll play devils advocate for a moment and mention, at least, that I am someone who likes to read in general and doesn't mind it when cutscenes aren't voiced. So perhaps the fact I found it as great as I did is because I don't really get into zoomer mentality/qualities of a lot of modern games where things are thrown out real fast without a lot of build up or are built around microtransactions and/or typical live service schemes.\n\nStory points aside, other noteworthy mentions are the fact that the music is amazing (I love a certain blues guitar theme), the combat design for all the new encounters, even in dungeons, is a step up from everything done before. Haven't seen encounter design actually make people pay attention in casual content like this since Stormblood. New jobs are great fun to play. The graphic and lighting overhauls are beautiful. The gear and new dye system are going to take glamour to another level. And the zones are just gorgeous.

Final Fantasy XIV is a game about legacy and memory, how we are remembered, how we remember others, how we tell stories, and Dawntrail is a masterpiece in following that through, because the new world respects its legacy, it respects your legacy, and by its end, it echoes in perfect chorus one of the game's most memorable lines:  \"Remember, that we once lived.\"\n\nAlso, the dungeons are *really* fun.", "timestamp_created": 1720193285, "timestamp_updated": 1720193285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494227081537246704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169065437", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968529300", "num_games_owned": 1152, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 276917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.\nNot at the same level as Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but I wasn't really expecting that anyway.\n\nAlso: Wuk Lamat is, in fact, not a terrible character.", "timestamp_created": 1720193227, "timestamp_updated": 1720193227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488858073949813843", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169065256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073099149", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "story: incredibly mid, english localization sucked\n\ncombat: they said they were trying to shake things up and it shows, excited to see what they do with savage and ultimate", "timestamp_created": 1720193077, "timestamp_updated": 1720193077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520891368389129639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169065140", "author": {"steamid": "76561199030464881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, the MSQ always has a lot of fetch quests, but the game overall has only improved with this expansion.

It has some of the best fights we've had in years for normal content, and some amazing Extremes, not to mention the new Expert dungeons. There are more mechanics, they happen faster, and healers have to be more on point to deal with incoming damage. Even in normal dungeons the bosses are not boring tank and spank bosses like some in Endwalker were. But while the fights are great, the classes are either unchanged or even more simplified and homogenized. Not to the point where nothing distinguishes a Summoner from a Red Mage anymore, but the Tanking jobs especially just feel like they all work the same now with VERY small differences.\n\nThe new jobs, on the other hand, are fantastic. Pictomancer is the standout as a tough but satisfying caster, and Viper, while seeming complicated at first, is a satisfying melee DPS with amazing animations and sounds. I have never been a melee DPS guy, but I might start maining Viper for those crisp animations alone.\n\nThe new zones are the most beautiful we've had in the game, and the graphical update is really putting a lot of work in to make them stand out. Compared to even Shadowbringers' zones this is on a whole different level. They are also a lot easier to navigate and this makes it very fun to just roam around in them doing FATEs or sidequests. And if you're tired of land-based travel: it's much simpler this time around to unlock Aether currents and be able to fly.\n\nThe music is as good as we've come to expect, with lots of good variety and a few standout tracks for the second and third trials of the expansion. There is your standard heroic fantasy stuff but we also get more rock and folk inspired music, as well as some more techno and lo-fi inspired songs. Compared to Endwalker this new OST feels like a fresh of breath air, or better yet, a return to the more daring soundscape of Shadowbringers.\n\nWhere it really stumbles is in one of the main draws: the story. It is not bad per se, and the back half is full of exciting and emotional moments. But the first half feels slow, spending a lot of time on building up this new world and its various cultures and places. I think the raising of the stakes that happens halfway through wouldn't be nearly as effective without it, but don't go in thinking you're going to be on the edge of your seat right away as you might've been in Shadowbringers.\n\nCharacters are the main weak point. Your enjoyment will depend entirely on whether or not you like one of the main characters of the new story, given how central she is to everything. I do not think the overall voice performance of the character is bad, but she falls short in critical moments where an delivery really needs to be emotional, and the fact that she is so central to the story really amplifies this problem.\n\nAside from her there are also multiple moments where well-established characters give...extremely strange performances, to the point where I sometimes wondered if the voice actors were replaced halfway through. I can only assume there are issues in voice direction, as all of these actors have solid track records, and the VAs for new side-characters completely knock it out of the park.\n\nPersonally, I was also disappointed how two very important characters, Krile and Erenville, really did not get the screentime I felt they deserved. Both have very touching stories that are core to the overall plot, but we never really get a moment where our main character speaks with them one-on-one, or where they get to show how their struggle affects and changes them. On top of this the game insists on constantly bringing back the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who have no story arc and barely do anything, except for moments where they are *suddenly* critical to the story. It really feels like the writers were told to bring them back, since they are fan favorites, but didn't know what to actually do with them.\n\nI think this expansion is worth the time and money, if only for all the cool new stuff. The story underdelivers compared to the absolute peak stuff we've had before, but I didn't come away hating it either.", "timestamp_created": 1720191389, "timestamp_updated": 1720191701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498533755540847778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169062947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068044409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "french", "review": "Toujours aussi bien", "timestamp_created": 1720191192, "timestamp_updated": 1720191192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169062290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003679003", "num_games_owned": 869, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1](SPOILER FREE)[/h1]\n\n[h3]Summary:[/h3]\nExpansion that's thankfully carried by practically everything but the story. If you rate Dawntrail on the basis of Zones, Music, Dungeons/Trials/ETC - It's an phenomenal expansion. \n\nWith a story? . . . Oh well.  I'd still recommend it but seemingly mismatched intentions, lackluster writing and pushing [i]certain characters[/i] in every crevice will disappoint a lot of MSQ oriented players.\n\n\n[h3]\"Find your wings and spread them wide.\"[/h3]\n\nI'd like to keep it brief as with everything you should experience the Expansion by yourself. This review isn't supposed to steer you towards buying it (or not) but mostly as an recollection and subjective opinion. If you're an active XIV player it's simply impossible to partake in the game without latest expansion so hey - At least you'll know what you're getting into.\n\nFirst six hours is a slog, which mostly consist of you walking, talking to people and exploring the extremely well crafted areas. In fact - You basically encounter minimal fighting before the first dungeon, which is a precedent for the entire MSQ. I daresay that it was as bad as pre-nerfed ARR wine arc which should tell you exactly everything. Instead of sense of adventure and exploring new continent like trailer would like you to imagine It's more akin watching an youtube vlogger visiting those places themselves. Extremely annoying vlogger. \n\n[b]And her name is Wuk Lamat[/b]\n\nI really, really tried to like Wuk Lamat, throughout my entire experience and I have to say that towards the end she wasn't horrible. Just bad. (Or maybe it's the Stockholm syndrome from spending so much time with her?). Her entire presence is so overwhelming that besides being tedium to you, she actively makes all other characters worse. Really. It feels like writers made her important to the point of others not receiving proper development. Especially after halfway point a lot of those you meet have seemingly really interesting baselines that are sadly not explored or developed. Why? Because Wuk Lamat. A lot of story beats could be way better without her, especially right at the end. \n\nI'm not saying that she's the worst character in the expansion (Because certain red head is) but considering that more than 90% of quests include her. . . she'll get tiresome extremely quickly.\n\nNevertheless I liked some bits of the story and ending was nice. It would be nicer without her though! Eh . . . Yeah.\n\nErenville and S. deserved way better.\n\n[h3]\"No Limits will bind me!\"[/h3]\n\nNow. Everything else. Zones? Great. Music? Phenomenal. Dungeons and Trial? Phenomenal. \nTwo hub cities are distinct and different from each other and offer something fresh compared to everything we've seen so far. One nitpick I have is that second one is tad too spread out. But sights are great. \n\nBoth dungeons and Trials aren't too easy and aren't too hard either giving a fair difficulty. If you die it's mostly skill issue, and not the design of the encounter.  Not much I can say without spoiler territory but I can assure you those are the best encounters in entire XIV.\n\nPictomancer and Viper from my limited experience are fun classes. Viper especially so, with given challenge of learning and \"busyness\" (which is getting adjusted, for some reason) and should be easy to pick up. \n\nOverall - Everything that's not MSQ Story is great. I'm sure people who don't care about it and skip everything will have swell time - They'll have to skip a lot though lmao. \n\nIf I'd have to rate entire expansion without Story - Easy 9/10. Great. Amazing. Problem is - You cannot. And I just cannot think of proper score for it overall. What's fair? How you should weight different elements? I leave that, my dear viewer - To you. \n\nThanks for reading! \n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1720190641, "timestamp_updated": 1720190641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697535872459411621", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169061095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157770198", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 586535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7008, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably 14's highest quality story of any expansion, less personal than ShB and EW, and therefor it may not resonate with people as well, but Dawntrail's pacing and characters are both truly incredible, I feel like most who are downvoting it either A, dislike that for the first time ever your WoL is NOT the main focus of a story and they can't handle it, or simply haven't finished it yet.", "timestamp_created": 1720189636, "timestamp_updated": 1720189636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491884559392929077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169060878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115349983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Story was fantastic with the exception of one hiccup towards the end.

The trials have all been amazing, the mechanics, atmosphere and music have all been top notch and are some of my favourite fights in the game.\n\nGenuinely very impressed here, starting a new story after Endwalker was never going to be easy, and with the post-Endwalker content being a bit lackluster, I was worried, but I've genuinely really enjoyed what they've put into this expansion so far. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1720181298, "timestamp_updated": 1720181298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549536228179931641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169050834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277130920", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 544986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5880, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "so much better than endwalker's msq it's not even remotely close", "timestamp_created": 1720180804, "timestamp_updated": 1720180804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443083673715591431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169050477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017132483", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 319170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "These reviews really are wild. Some of them complaining about a format that every MMO, including XIV has followed for years. Go to place. Do quest. Go to place. Do quest. Talk to 37 people and then do a fight. \n\nThat's what we've always had. If you're expecting a drastic change here, then you will likely be disappointed. As much as Expansions like Shadowbringers and Endwalker are lauded as perfect, they followed the same cycle. But we were several expansions deep into an established story, so all of that talk had already gotten the support of being consequential. \n\nThis is a new story arc. We're starting from a place adjacent to square one and a new story has to be established. Just like the community will tell you that ARR is a dredge through boredom, but worth it because that story pays off, they'll be saying the same about Dawntrail a few Xpacs down the line. \n\nBut the key difference is Dawntrail is actually fun to play inbetween all of the slow burn story. and it picks up its own contained excitement in the meantime as well. This is some of the best actual content that we've had in several expansions, with the difficulty curve being turned up a reasonable level to account for our growth as players. The story starts off quaint and picks up heavily about half way through. \n\nThe biggest downfall that Dawntrail can be said to have, is that it didn't commit to one path, which managed to upset folks in both camps of. \"I want a slow, relaxing expansion\" and \"I want the action to continue ramping up\". Had they picked a path and stuck with it, you'd see many of these reviews disappear. \n\nWhat this expansion brought to the table so far:\nFantastic battle content. \n\nBeautiful zones, with a soundtrack to match. \n\nLively zones, 5 of the 6 feeling extremely lively even if nobody else is around you. Like a flushed out world, which we haven't had properly since SHB. \n\nA new cast of side characters. each with their own backstories that leave plenty of room to dive further into, while still giving enough to get a feel for who they are. \n\nVisual updates like crazy\n\nAn engaging storyline that picks up over the course of the expansion. It isn't as sudden as some say, It gives plenty of notice before it begins to ramp up if you're paying proper attention. While you get more involved in the action at a fast pace, the action was always brewing around you if that makes sense. \n\nWuk Lamut. A mirror held up to your Warrior of Light showing yourself at the beginning of your journey. She takes center stage as the focus of the expansion, and we become the supporting cast. She is naive, overly optimistic, and extremely quick to the trigger. An adorable character, 10/10 no notes. \n\nWhat DT lacked: \nA more engaging main enemy. Rather than setting up a larger scale threat to follow course over, we seemed to have gotten fairly \"one and done\" enemies.  While one did carry a good moral grey area, it wasnt enough to be compelling to see there side as we've seen in some past expansions. \n\nThe final zone needs fixed. It's just not good as is at the end of the story. \n\nA clear directional theme. Because it rode that line between two themes, it became a jack of all trades, master of none. \n\n````````````````\n\n\nall in all, I would rate this expansion second place behind shadowbringers, and just ahead of endwalker. It gave character development to old and new characters alike, and set the scene for a pretty grand stage so far.

However the story and content ramps up very rapidly and  this is actually now my favorite FF14 expansion.  I was blown away by the second half.  Highly recommended.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW AFTER 15 HOURS\n\nI've got 1700+ hours in FF14.  I really really love this game and I was super excited for this expansion.\n\nI really want to like Dawntrail.   FF14 is a special game for me.  The world building, story building, engaging story and quests have also held a special place for me in MMOs and RPGs.\n\nI had 2 difficult times with this game:\n\n-Post ARR quests (I think patch 2.1 to 2.55) : as a new player I joined I think when SB launched, so I played from level 1, through ARR, there were dozens of MSQ quests that gave no XP and that seemed like filler between expansions and these were baaaaaaddd.  I almost quit\n-This expansion (Dawntrail).   Hours of just cut scenes and fetch quests and talk to NPCs.  I'm like 10+ hours in and I think I had to fight 3 monsters so far.  \n\nI keep being told it will pick up in the second half but so far it's been non engaging, non fun, cutscene simulator\n\nEDIT : I'm seriously about to rage quit and ask for a refund.

They had learned their lessons from the beginning of Endwalker and solved the congestion problems. Well, the first entrants did of course fill up to the brim with thousands of people in the queue, but I got in relatively quickly! And, despite everything... the first part really was a challenge to go through. Not in difficulty, mind you, but in how slow it all was.\n\nI get it, we're basically having a soft-reboot and we need to really get into wordlbuilding, but... it's been 40 main quests, and nothing much has happened! Most of what we did was fight the small mobs and have to rely on the omnipresent being known as Wuk Lamat. She's everywhere, even when I sleep now! Each time I close my eyes, I see Wuk Lamat. Just her. To be fair, it is her story for this expansion, so I can understand if we're a bit of a sideshow in this whole situation. But I digress. Her presence in the entire expansion is overwhelming.\n\nSPOILERS FOR LVL 95+:\nAfter [spoiler]The cooking challenge[/spoiler], which was arguably the most boring part for me. [spoiler]It was literally no fighting, just listening again about how that chad king Gulool Ja Ja united people with food.[/spoiler]. But, after that part, the expansion finally shook things up We would go on to be in [spoiler]The wild west areas of the map, and follow a somewhat mediocre story of a corrupt deputy smuggling riches into Tuliyollal. I do say mediocre, but it was an enjoyable idea, until the town over would completely detonate inside a sphere and give everyone in that one a time skip of 30 years.[/spoiler] So then, after all that is said and done, we were graced by truly some of the most fascinating storytelling I've had in a long time. \n\nSPOILERS FOR LVL 97+:\n[spoiler]Solution Nine[/spoiler] was probably the best city in the game for the longest time! Everything was beautiful, the [spoiler]Neon lighting and futuristic decor[/spoiler] were all incredible. And although many would argue that the setting wouldn't make any sense with the setting of the game, I find that it was a completely welcome but sensible change of pace.\n\nSPOILERS FOR LVL 99+:\nFinally, the part that I found most incredible was the last area.  [spoiler]We would indeed find the city of gold, but it was at times very disturbing. It was practically heaven, people were able to live life and enjoy everything, but they required aether to survive, and that already was in a dire state. It was a truly beautiful sight, with the nostalgic and sorrowful background music. They were all memories of a person given life and conciousness, yet it felt like we were killing them. They were granted an eternal heaven, but it felt bitter pulling the plug on them.[/spoiler]\n\nAt that point, it became clear that Dawntrail's story was not just the beginning of a new adventure, [spoiler]but it was also a story about letting go. We would say goodbye to those we had only just met, and watching Krile reunite briefly with her mother and father, as well as Erenville getting to spend time with his until we bravely said goodbye, choosing to let go of the past and moving on. [/spoiler] the story truly finished on a perfect high note that I was truly able to enjoy. [spoiler]The  city we left behind after we were done was a husk of what it originally was. All greyed out, lifeless, with only the sky and no lights from any of the buildings to greet us. It was sorrowful and quite the tearjerker. And yet, it was [/spoiler] a truly beautiful ending.\n\nAs for the other content, like the dungeons, trials, and the future raids, I held myself to a high expectation, and that one was truly innovative. I had A LOT of fun playing this expansion, and the design in these dungeons were utterly beautiful, with the looks and adventures we got to enjoy absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe story: 7/10 (The buildup was some of the most boring moments I've had, but that truly powerful ending... I feel I can be pleased with what it had achieved and how it was written.)\n\nThe dungeons and trials: 10/10 (Easily the coolest part about this expansion. Each dungeon was absolutely phenomenal with the boss mechanics, and the trials had some of the coolest boss moves I've ever seen. Truly different and innovative to the very end.)\n\nOverall, a respectable 8.5/10. It was an excellent expansion that I managed to thoroughly enjoy.

A good start to the next arc, though some rough edges that will hopefully be smoothed out going forward. A few specifics, with a warning to minor spoilers possible:\n\nStory - I personally liked it, but I can see where it has it's challenges. Without Major spoilers, it's very focused on what your character can do to guide another character that's basically new. That's going to present two challenges for story-lovers: Are you comfortable with your character taking a bit of a backseat? Do you gel with the introduction and growth of the new character? If you don't, the story's going to be challenging.\n\nI'm happy they're taking risks in telling the story different ways, but they leaned a little too heavily on one character and that can make it hit or miss. I do think some of the reviews are overly harsh, but that's the risk inherent.\n\nIt also drags a little too long on some items and rushes others. This has happened before, but was particularly noticeable this time.\n\nMusic: Excellent tracks, some real bangers, particularly later game. Some questionable choice of where certain tracks were used, which is normally something they knock out of the park. Nothing terribly bad, but some \"Could have been better\"\n\nCombat: 10/10. The Trials and dungeons have been great so far, some of the dungeon mechs have actually made me sweat a little bit. Yes, as we get practice and gear that will fade a bit, but a great start and a good step forward.\n\nZone design: Fan-tastic. Excellent visuals, little details that make things gel so well and really make it feel like a lived in world. \n\nAt the end of the day, I wanted ARR-but-better and that's about what I got. Dawntrail just missed the mark of Heavensward, and that's no insult as Heavensward is excellent.

First I would give it an overall rating of 6/10. Even though I enjoyed it other expansions far outrank it. For me the high points of the FFXIV franchise are the Heavensward and Shadowbringers expansions with SB being my all time favorite.\n\nWuk Lamat as a character did not annoy me as much as it did other people but she is a somewhat one note vanilla character. She is either spewing her guts out from seasickness or she is engaging in touchy feely expositions. Her character progression throughout the expansion is inconsistent. One moment she is completely vulnerable and the next she becomes a super hero. She seems to flip flop between these two states throughout the story. The writing for the character is inconsistent and the writers can\u2019t seem to decide if she wants to be a mewling kitten or something with more substance.\n\nErenville seems to be better written but gets pushed to the back in favor of other characters. The best part of his development is towards the end of the expansion but I can\u2019t help but feel it is too little too late.\n\nBakool Ja Ja is an interesting character but then half way through the story the character loses steam and he is relegated to a minor character. I think this was a missed opportunity. \n\nSphene becoming the protagonist was interesting but she turns into the standard big baddy trope of the expansion. I want someone like the Emet-Selch character who still remains the best villain in the game to date.\n\nZoraal Ja was probably the most interesting character for me and then towards the end he turns into a complete psychopath and is killed off.\n\nUnless I completely missed it we still don\u2019t know what happened to Galuf Baldesion.\n\nThe rest of the characters were just bit players in the saga. We get dragged around a fair bit and do a lot of nodding and shrugging. As a \u201cheroes on vacation\u201d story it probably made sense but IMO it had less impact than the start of FFXIV 2.0.\n\nAs for the rest of Dawntrail the new instances/dungeons/trials were great if not slightly frustrating with the new difficulty but once you learn the patterns and gear up they become easier. The new graphics are good and especially some of the zones in Dawntrail but some zones were very uninspiring. The music is good except for the Dawntrail closing credits music/song which was awful.\n\nI like the Pictomancer class. It has big damage numbers and an easy rotation.

There's one complaint I don't understand - that we're not the main focus of the story... brother, what rock have you been living under? The endwalker set-up for dawntrail made it very clear Wuk Lamat would be the focus for this story - she's competing in a succession contest and you were expecting you to be the one to take the crown? makes no sense to me. Anyway, the character itself is very well written, evidence to that is how split people are on her character - some hate her, others love her - in today's day and age, it takes balls to write a character like that and not settle for a bland generic character that no one would care one way or the other.\n\nTL;DR: It's good! msq has some issues, but which expansion didn't?", "timestamp_created": 1720162531, "timestamp_updated": 1720162531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503133416175842285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169035165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198013807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not like Dawntrail.\n\nI've played FFXIV as my main game since the very beginning of Stormblood. I LOVE this game, I love the stories, the music, the zones, the encounters, the love and care that they pour into this game. I don't like Dawntrail. I love every other expansion, and it follows YOU, the main character, on your adventure. You're called the Warrior of Light, or other monikers, and the story has had its ups and downs. It's introduced other characters that you get close to and learn, but they ultimately are rotated out as your steady companions follow along with you, and occasionally you might gain a new one.\n\nDawntrail introduces a character that takes the spotlight completely. The world revolves around this character, to the point that you're pigeon-holed into nodding encouragingly from time to time as this character comes to terms with their growth. Do they grow? Of course, it's a Final Fantasy game. Is it a natural growth? Sure. Do I care? Not really. You don't grow together. It isn't like in Heavensward when you're walking alongside Estinien and Ysayle, or Alphinaud. It isn't Lyse who eventually finds her footing in Stormblood, and she was already a divisive character. The Dawntrail main character is someone else who dominates every scene, and you're relegated to chasing after them until halfway through when YOUR story finally begins, and that's when the story picks up.\n\nI don't think it's selfish to want to be invested and integral to the story.

Some teething issues in the storyline, but overall better than Stormblood, but given being the first chapter in a new story, obviously not as engaging as Shadowbringers or Endwalker. Due to the absence of established compelling storythreads.\n\nSpoilerless TLDR;\nIs the storyline in essence a deconstruction, reconstruction and whole hearted embrace of shonen anime tropes? Yes. And if that doesn't bother you, it's quite fun.\nIs Dawntrail \"woke\" in a negative sense? No, not unless you view Naruto to be \"woke\" in such a way. Being that both storylines are remarkably similar in topic and themes. Namely trauma and peacemaking.\nDoes the storyline feel rushed at times? Unfortunately, yes. The storyline could have been extended to encompass two or even three expansions. But luckily the moments that feel too quick are only a few and they do not detract overmuch from the storyline.\n\nThe storyline takes a rather bold and experimental choice of [spoiler]making the Warrior of Light a mentor character, rather than the main character. With Wuk Lamat being mentored to become Tural's equivalent of the Champion of Eorzea. A story beat hammered in by her job being 'Warrior' and her royal title being 'Dawn's Promise.' Signifying WoL's ascension to the role left by Hydaelyn/Venat.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Dawn being the rising of the sun, and WoL/Azem having sun as their symbol. And the title Wuk Lamat is pursuing being 'Dawnservant.' The theme of WoL effectively taking on an apprentice is rather obvious in hindsight.[/spoiler]\n\nAnother rather bold choice in storytelling is [spoiler]the clear two chapter structure of the story. Where the initial mentorship storyline is resolved. With Wuk Lamat's ascension to the throne being the first half and the \"City of Gold\" being the second half.\n[/spoiler][spoiler]The perhaps boldest choice in terms of storyline and zone design is the fact that you end up destroying the \"City of Gold,\" with it's beauty and serenity. And while I do wish it went differently, perhaps that's the point?[/spoiler]\n\nFinal bold choice of note is [spoiler]that Wuk Lamat would appear to be an ADHDer, this isn't extremely strongly signalled, beyond the \"genki girl\" stereotype that she embodies. However, few \"blink and you miss it\" comments by Erenville and the fact that she stays her impulsive and hyper-empathetic self to the end. With her character arc being more about accepting that she doesn't need to be perfect and asking for help is the wise choice, rather than her inherent nature changing.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created":

The stories and characters are as great as they always are, the dungeons and raids are stellar, the music is in a tier of its own, but the pacing and content that is used to pad the runtime is often mundane and repetitive. Experiencing and learning about the world CBU3 has weaved is always a pleasure, but quest structure has remained unchanged for years now and if FFXVI is any indication, I dont think it's necessarily the aging infrastructure that XIV is built on that's making things like this. For an expansion that's so heavily pushed as being \"an adventure,\" Dawntrail's maps are certainly bigger and prettier, but the way you explore them is the same as every prior expansion, speckled with the occasional fate and hunt train plowing through. GW2 is still undefeated as the most fun MMO to actually explore. \n\nI've seen many people take issue with Wuk Lamat. I don't get the hate. From the get-go, she was poised to be the focus of this story. The final Endwalker questline is literally Wuk Lamat showing up and asking you to help her compete in the rite of succession. Wuk Lamat is a fine character. She, alongside the WoL, go and learn all about the peoples who inhabit Yok Tural. I am fine with her being the star of this expansion, but I think we spend too much time with Wuk Lamat. Way, waaay too much time with her. because of the way quests are designed in this game, nearly every single quest opens and closes with you talking to her. Dawntrail might be the most repetitively written MSQ we've seen so far, and the first half of the MSQ is really predictable, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it takes a long time to get to a very obvious conclusion, but it is still satisfying to see the promises go through their respective arcs.\n\nHaving actually completed the story, I can confirm that while the pacing is all over the place for the first half, once the rite of succession is over, and you get past the mediocre fourth zone, it picks up a lot of momentum, it gets weird, it gets existential, it gets melancholic, it is appropriately \"final fantasy-y.\" The last zone might be my favorite in the whole game.", "timestamp_created": 1720156005, "timestamp_updated": 1720156005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495912492275238037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169030263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064342927", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 56837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR It's easy to linger on the negatives, but I truly did enjoy my time in Dawntrail and recommend it. The main character and certain story beats that are presented are not everyone's cup of tea, and those are understandably a major point of contention. This is, however, still Final Fantasy 14 and the start of a new saga and I can't wait to see what this new saga has in store.\n\nRecommending something is rarely black and white. I am very much recommending the expansion. It has a pretty good story, its content (MSQ dungeons and trials) are pretty strong. However... there are some issues that lead some people to understandably not like the expansion.\n\nThe story, in my opinion, was an all around good time. There were slow parts, especially the start. I liked the rite of succession arc because of how it played thematically in the game. I know some people probably couldn't care less but I enjoyed the in-universe sentiment behind them. Meeting new people, exploring different cultures, and even learning how they view honor, labor, and death was fun worldbuilding on a continent we've never been to, especially since we aren't necessarily the main character in this story. However, not everyone likes the idea of us taking a more supportive role rather than a main role, and that is understandable. After Endwalker, I was totally okay with a casual story where we sat back because it felt like something my Warrior of Light and I needed. For all intents and purposes, a major part of this expansion feels like a beach vacation because the first 6-7 levels of the expansion offer a low-stake competition that acts as a palate cleaner for the epic drama saga conclusion that was Endwalker.\n\nYet, Dawntrail is an expansion with two stories that happen sequentially, and the second story is significantly better and offers much higher stakes. The story picks up quick and it picks up hard and this was when I knew Dawntrail was going to be at least better than Stormblood. This part of the story sets up new ideas and offers a glimpse into where the next saga will go. I will say that the final area is magnificent and a masterclass of storytelling and environment. It is inexplicably a beautiful story in an otherwise dower situation.\n\nThere is, however, a lion in the room that should be talked about. I like the characters in FFXIV. I like Alisaie and the Scions a lot as we've spent so long getting to know them. I understand the want for a new group, but I desperately hope that the new character Wuk Lamat is not the direction this new group will go if we're indeed getting a new one. The main reason I do not like this expansion is because of Wuk Lamat, but not because she's inherently a bad character.\n\nWuk Lamat is as persistent as the aether in the soil. Every quest is seemingly about you talking to her. You have this group that you've gotten to know for so long and the expansion spends so much time trying to separate you from them and pairing you with Wuk Lamat every opportunity. It's infuriating and it's grating. I do not have a problem with Wuk Lamat as a character, in fact I wanted to like her, but it feels like I was being beaten over the head with her character and that made her an annoyance rather than a companion. I wanted more from the Scions. I understand that it's her story, but surely that didn't mean we needed to spend every waking moment with her and completely neglecting the relationships we've built since the beginning.\n\nThere are some other issues I have, including some massive plot holes in the story. While the expansion spends so much time talking about embracing tradition and other cultures, it is not quick to disavow an objectively abhorrent practice that I can only hope is talked about in a later patch. [spoiler] In Alexandra, souls are stripped of their memories and recycled when a person dies of natural causes to give others who died prematurely another chance at life. Wouldn't this be denying the people who lived a full life and died naturally a proper death? As I've come to know it, when we die our souls and aether are returned to the Lifestream. Our memories are cleansed and preserved and our consciousness remains intact. We live on in all but body. What of the Alexandrians who have their memories stripped and their souls recycled? This should've been something we spoke up about but we remain silent and just kinda say \"oh, well, that's your culture i guess...\" I feel the topic of death as a whole was criminally under-explored and wasted in the story [/spoiler]\n\nI look forward to what's next and I hope the complaints of the story and characters reach the right people. This expansion is not a misstep, it is not a step back, and it's certainly not anything to garner concern. It's a more divisive story that really depends on what the person can stomach. It's a step in a new direction and things won't always seem as great as it was in Shadowbringers or Endwalker. These are the growing pains of a brand new saga, but I could not be more excited for the future.\n\nThis isn't including the two new classes or any extra dungeons or trials or content. I care strongly for the MSQ and its story, it's what's important to me and what I care the most about in an expansion.

You lean about individual cultures in an adventure that contributes to a larger overall plot that has a satisfactory number of twists towards its end, and while it starts of simpler and more predictable, I thought it was a great way to gently lead into the expansion, especially for how much there is to cover. The end of the Act I story also establishes the stakes for[/spoiler]\nAct II [spoiler]where things become far more serious and typical of a Final Fantasy story.

Yes, Dawntrail is not as good of a story as Endwalker or Shadowbringers was. Is it bad? Absolutely not. As it was marketed this Expansion is the new Dawn for the game, preparing for the next 10 years. This expansion should be compared to A Realm Reborn (if anything), is it better? Absolutely yes.\nThe story was very well written. The biggest flaw of it was by far the pacing, but that can be solved by skipping some of the slower parts  if you are not too interested in it. Characters are very enjoyable, have a good development arc, just as you would expect from any FF (imo its leauges better than FF16). The story expands on the lore very well, takes you to very interesting locations, sets up stuff for the future. It does what it needed to do.\n\nCombat encounters 10/10\nI think the encounter design has drastically improved, I have subbed since stormblood but this is by far the best max level dungeon and trial experience I had. Fights keep on your toes, they deal adeqaute damage, punish your for mistakes but rewards you for good execution. So far the starting part, was always overly easy, on many fights straight up boring. There might be some recency bias here, but I think they jsut objectively improved on it (as they said they would), like with the indicators and variety and frequency of the mechanics, it looks very promising for the rest of expansion.\n\nJob design 7/10\nSo far for me this is the weakest, but still not bad at all. Jobs barely changed since SHB as far as I can tell, more streamlining everyone is getting a follow up skill, no major gameplay changes aside from like Astro and maybe a few others. It a solid state, probably easy to balance (althought so far pictomancer seems bonkers strong) \nThey said starting from 7.1 they make improvements to give the jobs back their identity and 8.0 might do the big overhaul we need.\n\nGraphics 11/10\nThis is great, this has been the main focus, and they delivered hard. The environments look stunning, they updated everything retroactively. Textures and vegetation are very pleasing to look at, character models are great. Older gear was not updated yet, but it is in the pipeline.\n\nPost launch content ?/10\nSo far we don't know yet, but what was announced it is already more and looks better than EW and SHB combined.\nExploration zone, deep dungeon, criterion, cosmic exploration and ofc the usual raids and ultimates, just to name a few.\n\nOverall I think it is a solid expansion to soft reboot the story (since EW finished it completely), the problem that people have that they comapre the story to EW, but that is just an impossible task. EW was an accumulation of 10 years of writing and climax of it all. This is a brand new adventure with clean slate, that will only get (hopefully) better.", "timestamp_created": 1720154033, "timestamp_updated": 1720154033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50010991096496582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169028489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069599967", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "wuk lamat", "timestamp_created": 1720153671, "timestamp_updated": 1720153682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490121573209762573", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169028101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174777639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a stellar time of this expansion, and was blindsided by how many people seem to so actively dislike it. People seem to be claiming several things that are just inherently untrue, or are exaggerated to an extreme degree. There will be spoilers in this review. To start, we'll address the cat in the room, Wuk Lamat. Unironically, I think she's one of the better written characters in the game. People talking about her falling over with tears in her eyes are referring to one singular cutscene still very early in the game. She complains about modes of transportation a few times, again only in the early game, but people seem to lack the media literacy to notice that those traits start to vanish pretty early on. \n\nTo add to this, Wuk Lamat isn't just treated as a leader for no reason, and characters, including her own father say that as of the start of the Rite, she wouldn't be worthy of the throne, and that she needs to learn it over the course of the travels around the continent. And she does just that. Each civilization who lives in her homeland, she meets, converses with, and comes to understand. That is her greatest trait, is her want and capacity for understanding. She meets people on their own level, wanting to know their customs, traditions, way of life and hardships, so she can better help them. This is the main trait that goes against the claims of her being a Lyse 2.0, as Lyse just barged into places and demanded the people there come around to her way of thinking. She's not afraid to knock skulls, but will definitely try to convince you not to beforehand. \n\nNext is the claim that the Warrior of Light doesn't matter in the story. This is simply untrue, as you do plenty to help Wuk Lamat come to her way of thinking, and take several sections of the story by the helm. The WoL is over here for support, guidance, and helping her. So it'd spit in the face of that notion if the Warrior of Light just solos everything with godslaying might to slap someone onto the throne. THAT would give some validation to the claim that some people have of it being a \"White savior\" story. But in the same breath they complain about Wuk Lamat running things, ignoring that she's a local entirely. But besides that, the WoL doesn't NEED to be the main character in the spotlight all the time.\n\nPeople seem to have forgotten that before Shadowbringers and Endwalker, Heavensward and Stormblood had pretty little focus on the Warrior of Light themselves. Alphinaud was absolutely the main character through most of HW, and Lyse acted as such for SB. Pretending this is a wholly new thing that's terrible is showing blindness to where the story has come from, and where it can go. It's absurdly limiting to the narrative of the game if every expansion just needs to focus on the Warrior of Light going around running things and punching gods. \n\nI'm ultimately not going to talk as much about the content itself, nor the music, as everyone, even detractors to the expansion, seem to agree it's some of the best it's ever been. The MSQ has it's fair share of moments it could have tossed a bit more gameplay at us, certainly, as it did feel that by the time you unlock the first dungeon, you'd only had maybe two or so mandatory mob battles. Considering some of the reworks, this did lead to a lot of people in the first dungeon not having a full grasp of how their kits worked by then. In the end, this is now tied for my second favorite expansion in the game, tied with Shadowbringers for it's wonderful character writing, with special shoutouts to Wuk Lamat, Koana, and the final boss character. It doesn't quite live up to Endwalker, but that was a culmination of the entire story to this point. It wasn't attempting to usurp that finality at this point, though the final zone DID give Ultima Thule a run for it's money.

If you dislike the character, you will probably not like this expansion because unlike previous ones, you are more of a supporting character in another's story. Story itself can be split in two halves. First half I say is 9/10, while second half is 6/10. Wish the antagonists had a lot more fleshing out, felt more like they were tacked on. Story pacing seemed fine, with only 1 zone that dragged it down for me.\n\nCombat: 9/10\nDungeon design is peak this expansion. Very difficult mechanics that felt engaging and requires some skill and thought. Not EVERY boss fight is great, with one dungeon feeling like it could have been introduced in Stormblood or Shadowbringers in terms of difficulty. \n\nTrial fights are really good this expansion. Second and final trials of the normal version are really engaging and well designed, while the first trial is more on the basic side. Tried the extreme versions of the first and second trial and I can say they are REALLY fun, and now I'm looking forward to the raid series.\n\nVisuals: 8.5/10\nI like the overall design of the zones, characters, equipment, etc. Graphical overhaul has added a lot of textures to the game, though it can be subtle if you don't know what you're looking for. Would note that you shouldn't compare this to other games with hyper realistic graphics though.\n\nSound design: 9/10\nMusic is perfect score for me, I don't think I have a single negative to say about the music. Sound gets a ding due to ambient noises can get very distracting in certain cutscenes if your levels are off.\n\nOverall rating: 8.5\nI liked the overall expansion as a whole.

I have to give it around a 7/10. It would maybe even be a 7.5 if not for some really weird music choices. (Did that Disney inspired song have to be in the game? It ruins the vibe.)\n\nA lot of people are pointing towards the focus on Wuk Lamat as the main pain point, but honestly I enjoyed her. I do wish we got away from her a little more and got to do a bit of our own personal exploration, but I had a great time having our character be a little sidelined to take on a mentor role. As it is said in the trailer, our character did seem to be enjoying theirself for a change. The main issues I had came from a somewhat repetitive end half (although still interesting), with it feeling more like what we already experienced in past expansions with a new coat of paint. It was a safe choice for a bridging expansion, but I wish they decided to do something a little more ambitious. There was also a TON of filler that should have been cut. Without going into major spoilers, a prime example of that is a certain door I was EXTREMELY excited for was instead brushed aside for us to go fuck off in yeehaw land, leaving me somewhat dissapointed and just begging to get through that section so I can see the thing that we brushed over. This did happen for a valid plot reason I guess, but with a little rewriting it could have all still worked out in a way more satisfying way.\n\nTLDR; 7/10.

Captain Lixire Kirk is here and I just finished my Dawntrail journey and just wanted to share my thoughts about it. This will be a full review of the expansion regarding the content featured within the main story as of patch 7.0 and will be discussing the good parts, the bad ones and my general feeling with Dawntrail.\n\nSo without further ado, Let's get started..\nAfter Endwalker has been finished and fully concluded by the final post MSQ quests of that expansion. it did also mean that the original arc of Hydaelyn-Zodiark that has begun with 1.0, came to an end fully by patch 6.5 with the final fight against Zeromus.\nFor those are interested to know what happened to the Garleans after Endwalker, I strongly suggest doing the Master Role Quests to get more of an idea of how the way of life went out for them.\n\nBut back to the topic. as a result, Dawntrail will be starting a new story arc within the FFXIV lifetime and therefore expected to feature lower stakes and have a much longer introduction than the usual parts.\nThe expansion starts from where post Endwalker has ended, our Warrior of Light, the Scions and Wuk Lamat who did visit Eorzea, Old Sharlayan to try and gather our support will be sailing off to Tural and our purpose is to help Wuk Lamat to become the new Dawnservent. Despite what most people believe, the WoL does play an important role within the story as you will be supporting the said character during the journey.\n\nSo the good? First, the music being used for Dawntrail's trials and dungeons is outright hitting hard and I would argue that the music for the [spoiler] Vanguard [/spoiler] dungeon makes A Long Fall to feel slow in comparison. safe to say that Soken doesn't disappoint with his art!\n\nSecond, Seems like that Yoshida has listened to community feedback regarding the normal content and has decided to spice things up by making all of the dungeons and trials far more engaging in terms of mechanics and also fight encounters with boss fights to the point that an actual effort is needed to get through them which is a really welcome change after Endwalker's mindlessly easy normal content that was criticized by the majority of the community\n\nThird, the graphical update is simply gorgeous and finally brings FFXIV to the modern era of visual fidelity with much better lighting, higher quality textures and for the first time in history. more AA options other than FXAA which isn't really an AA but rather a simple post processing effect. the update also brought support for DLSS and FSR (for improved results for those who suffer from a blurry image or so, use FSR at the 99% 3D resolution scale). Not to mention that the graphical update helps to enhance the immersion of the new zones\n\nFourth and that might be a controversial opinion but the story itself is solid and does make a whole lot of sense once you attempt to understand it and get yourself into the shoes of your own character and think. We will talk about the weak points of the story during the review but it does get a whole lot better and will serve as a good starting point for future FFXIV expansions. the story does have high stakes to it but that becomes noticeable only in the second part of the Dawntrail MSQ (which is Level 96-100)\n\nWhere Dawntrail has missed the mark and why? a common saying in the community that Dawntrail has a similar vibe to the one of Stormblood where pacing was an issue and the introduction of new stuff into the story was painfully long to the point it does hurt immersion. Wuk Lamat as a great example of that.\nWuk Lamat by herself is a lovely character that feels good to attach to and understand her but the game tries it's best to make you sick of her constant presence with a very bad execution due to the questing and overload you with very long cutscenes each time (Speak with Wuk Lamat -> Speak with Wuk Lamat again -> Speak with Wuk Lamat yet again) Having context is extremely important but at the same time. having too much of it does exhaust the player and makes them bored and frustrated.\n\nSo what are my thoughts on the expansion and would I recommend it? The answer is definitely yes and its quite obvious to any active FFXIV player but overall, Despite the very big flaws in story telling. I would give Dawntrail about 8/10 as despite the rocky start of the story.. it does improve by a large margin and actually becomes more interesting. I would also really respect YoshiP's decision to give normal content some actual challenge which does increase replay value with it and might serve as a \"bridge\" in the long-term towards high end content\n\nHope you did enjoy the read and those who are starting their Dawntrail journey, I wish you the best of luck and have fun!

The primary issue as is apparent almost immediately, is that the majority of it is built upon the shoulders of a single character(another similarity to Stormblood), Wuk Lamat. This in it of itself is flawed, because an individuals opinion of this one character will then affect how they experience the whole of the expansion. Personally, I came into Dawntrail a Wuk Lamat enjoyer, and was glad to go around Tuliyolal exploring it with her as a tour guide, and then help her with the succession competition, going everywhere with Wuk Lamat, and watching Wuk Lamat grow and experience a character arc. A character arc that mostly concludes at the halfway point, at this point I was *very* tired of watching Wuk do things. I understand it was meant to be a mentorship, and I did enjoy watching her grow. But she has twice as much dialogue as all of the Scions combined. This is too much. Krile is very important to this story, but is sidelined to let Wuk talk most of the time. Erenville is incredibly important to the second half of the story, [spoiler] but even his own mother ignores him in favor of Wuk [/spoiler]. The second half of the story really gets the ball rolling however, ending strong, despite the continued feeling that every character is pointed at Wuk. As it does get to be more of a shared story. Overall I'd advise more pacing while playing through the story if you typically plow through like I do, it's not nearly as bad as people are saying, though again, it relies too heavily on Wuk Lamat. You can definitely have fun during the first half, and the second gets really good. \nThe dungeons are a fair bit harder than previously, but are ten times as fun. The mechanics in them have really started to get more experimental and active. The trials have seen less improvement, but that is more in part due to the fact that trial gameplay has always been better than dungeons, so less room to improve. Overall the instances are MUCH better than previously\nWe are seeing that the questing gameplay could use some work. It's less that it's gotten worse, and more so that it hasn't gotten better enough. It's time that the questing went past a few instances and walking around interacting with stuff. It'd be nice to see more minigames and stuff to spruce things up. There's an inspect mechanic in this, but it would be great to see some actual puzzle there, like connecting the pieces to the environment, or speculating what happened to cause the changes you're viewing. Could see some chocobo racing type mechanics for running away from stuff or something. Could do an ace attorney style press and present system for interrogation, overall things could really do with spice at this point.\nThe presentation and graphical updates are doing wonders, these are some of the best environments we've gotten in FFXIV history and the ambient music in these areas is phenomenal. The people who inhabit these lands are also diverse and interesting, though there's an odd lack of voice acting in comparison to previous expacs. Overall the presentation is generally amazing.\nOverall Dawntrail is a step up in some regards, and a step down in others. It's not a tumble like some are saying, but it would be good to examine it's shortfalls (especially in regards to zooming out the story a it), and improve going into the patches.", "timestamp_created": 1720137968, "timestamp_updated": 1720137968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169015949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116535484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I came into Dawntrail with low expectations.

Wuk Lamat being the most centric character shows incredible exploration and changes over time.\nThe two new classes play very fluidly, they're extra enjoyable.\nThe changes in graphics are positive, and they show off as much as possible. The amount of zooms on your character is proof of that hahaha\nNew areas are incredibly interesting, full of things to watch and explore, and if you enjoy tidbits of story hidden behind doors, this is also a wonderful expansion for it. Everything is novelty.\nThe dungeons and bosses are significantly harder than other expansions. Not to the point of being unplayable as new players, but it does feel as if the game understands that at this point, you should know what to do.\n\nCONS:\nAs wonderful as the story can be, some places feel a bit stretched out. Especially the parts between levels 95 and 97 (not the dungeons), were a bit... Hard. \nMultiple old classes feel a bit left in the dust, just getting a continuation button as new identity and calling it a day.\nIf you do not like Wuk Lamat, this expansion will feel extremely insufferable.\n\nStory bits \nThe story can easily be divided in two parts. The WOL goes on a holiday and becomes a bit of a side character. The pretense is Wuk Lamat requesting our support for her coronation, and in turn, we become her personal Merlin, guiding and showing her off how to properly understand her kingdom and people.\nThe second part is... Quite wild. Cannot really explain without spoilers. For Main scenario enjoyers, it is a delight. Grabs bits of lore and content you already knew, develops them into something new. \n\nSPOILER AREA. FULL MSQ SPOILERS!\n[spoiler] While knowing some characters for very little time, some such as Gulool Ja Ja have a great impression. All four of the participants in the rite of succession have very interesting evolution, although Zareel Ja has that take very deep inside the story, maybe a bit too late. He does feel irredeemable as a villain... And that is okay. Not every enemy has to be someone we cry for while beating them. [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] ... THAT SAID. Sphene's end was devastating, as she was someone whom all the time we just wanted to have switch sides, but it was completely impossible. She was, ultimately, a complete villain, ready to commit mass murders left and right, even if it was for the sake of her people, but in a similar way as Emet, she causes complicated emotions. Without going into the realm of phylosophy and opinions, she was a wonderful character, and her relationship with Wuk Lamat was something that definitely carried a lot of weight during the entire second half and end of the story. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall? 9/10. Some things never change, there's always some sections that feel forced, slow or uninteresting even, but the expansion promised a different experience, and delivered on it. It was not an epic like Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but it also just, does not try to be. It's its own story.

I genuinely thought this DLC was going to be very middle-of-the-road jaunt into the West. Maybe my lowered expectations had something to do with it, but I was genuinely surprised with how good this was! Some points from me:\n\n- I expected generic pacific islander music to match the themes, and instead I got some big bops from Soken, especially in the latter half! Hooboy all the Zone/Dungeon/Trial music has been absolutely incredible! Soken Blessed us once again!\n\n- The new zones are super fun to explore and travel in, full of rich lore and history of the people there, and while the zones were pleasant to the eye, I didn't expect the variety of zones we got in the latter half of the game - it was honestly pleasant to have my expectations to be subverted in such an insane way, especially for the last zone!\n\n- Combat is still combat, but I'm enjoying my level 100 abilities, and so far all the jobs feel pretty much like EW, but with some changes. Most are good, some are okay. But nothing bad that I've noticed yet, will probably change my mind once I get them all to 100.\n\n- Graphical update has been a GODSENT my eyes are blessed with such good visuals! Character models/textures look amazing, and I love it! Some bugs are still in the game, like Miqo'te hair clipping with headpieces, but I'm sure devs will fix by now.\n\n- Story started off a little bit predictable, and I honestly didn't know how I'd feel about all the new characters we meet. I was personally interested more in seeing Krile's & Erenville's side of the story more, but I found myself rooting for Wuk Lamat as she got less brash and more self-aware of the world around her. Her arc might have been predictable, but I enjoyed traveling with her nevertheless, and overall I think she's fine as a character. And then the 2nd half of the game hits and HOOOOOLY I LOVED THE 2ND HALF TO BITS ALL THE WAY DOWN \u2665 BEST PART OF THE GAME!\n\n- I've seen some angry comments about the WoL babysitting Wuk Lamat, but I feel its a bit of an over-reaction. FFXIV is a very character-focused and character-driven game where you travel with various companions from all walks of life and their own lived experiences and personalities, while the WoL just [i] Smiles and Nods [/i] at everything while slaying insurmountable foes. Only this time, they introduce Wuk Lamat, a totally inexperienced little kitten trying to roar like a lion and act like she gets it, when she really doesn't. She's okay. Not as good as the other Scions, but becomes more admirable the further you go. Krile and Evenville arc was definitely the best part of character-driven story for this DLC.\n\n- This DLC isn't about a world-ending threat, or a looming force over your head that needs to be stopped, like ShB or EW. Its an adventure, a vacation, a summer trip to the Western Islands to see the sights, enjoy the food, and learn more about the big world. With that said, its not without its own foes to defend the realm against, a threat that only the WoL can have any chance of stopping. Its a good mix of adventure and tension with some funny bits in-between.\n\nEndwalker DLC ended the final chapter of the Light vs Dark saga for the WoL. Dawntrail is like a start to a new chapter - its fresh step into a new journey and the discovery of the star. Its not Shadowbringers/Endwalker level of epic, but I feel its great as a \"Part 1\" into this new chapter.

There are more cutscenes than actual gameplay it seems this expansion which can be cool but not this time. I dont care about my 30 minute cutscene of Wuk Lamat being plucky to a fault and be silly.

E por isso o enredo \u00e9, naturalmente, mais lento do que o comum. Bons novos personagens, e bom desenvolvimento de alguns que tiveram pouco destaque anteriormente (Krile e Erenville). As duas novas Jobs s\u00e3o muito divertidas e foram bem recebidas pela comunidade. A trilha sonora continua impec\u00e1vel e maravilhosa, j\u00e1 \u00e9 uma tradi\u00e7\u00e3o do FFXIV.

Esse cuidado foi muito possivelmente gra\u00e7as \u00e0 atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o gr\u00e1fica do jogo.\n\nO destaque excessivo de um personagem prejudicou um pouco no enredo. Muitas miss\u00f5es que envolvem apenas di\u00e1logo podem ser massantes dependendo do jogador.\n\n[h2] Minhas considera\u00e7\u00f5es [/h2]\nMe assustei ao ver a m\u00e9dia de an\u00e1lises como neutras. E apesar de concordar com alguns pontos, n\u00e3o acredito que seja m\u00e9rito para determinar a expans\u00e3o como negativa. Dentre os pontos levantados, em especial, \u00e9 o protagonismo de uma das novas personagens: Wuk Lamat. A personagem tem muito destaque, chegando a ser excessivo, tirando um pouco da fantasia em que a hist\u00f3ria gira em torno do jogador. Na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 ben\u00e9fico que o jogador perca um pouco de destaque em prol de outros personagens, para que se desenvolvam e tenham alguma \"ag\u00eancia\", ao inv\u00e9s de tratar o jogador como Deus onipotente. Por\u00e9m, nesta expans\u00e3o, eu concordo que foi passado do ponto.\n\nOutro ponto destacado foi a quantidade de miss\u00f5es que se resumem a conversas. E apesar de ser verdade, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um ponto que me incomodou em boa parte da trajet\u00f3ria.

I\u2019ll try to be fair, thorough and concise. \nStarted off cautiously neutral, maybe a little optimistic. By the time I got to the end of Act 3 I was pretty positive on the expansion overall. Act 1 and 2 I rank somewhere just above Stormblood, but after Act 3 I\u2019d say it ranks somewhere near or above HW. It\u2019s still far below ShB, but it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s a decent start to a new storyline with the ending opening the gates to more places to explore. After EW this kind of lower stakes story was both inevitable and necessary. I don\u2019t know if people expected this expansion to live up to Endwalker standards, but that was never going to happen. \nThe two divisive factor for the community seems to be Wuk Lamat herself and WoL playing second fiddle to her, so whether you like the expansion depends entirely if you find her endearing or likeable. I think she\u2019s fine, kind of like Lyse 2.0, hence the comparison to Stormblood. I\u2019ll talk more about her later.\nSome say that the story is slow, or at least that the first Act is slow. I don\u2019t share that sentiment. At least not when it comes to the first playthrough. I can imagine it feeling slow as hell if you decided to replay it. I\u2019ve played through SB twice and hated the second go of it. I can easily imagine feeling the same way about Act 1 on a second go.\n My problem with Acts 1 and 2 was different. A problem that forced me to create a way to describe it. I call it the \u201chacky but plausible writing\u201d factor. There were quite a few events in the story that felt like hacky writing, but were plausible enough to just move on. Some resolutions to problems were a bit too convenient, too easy, too contrived. At least one of them was created by the need to insert a trial. Then it was resolved with no consequences. And that\u2019s an example of the hacky, but plausible factor. If not for that, I would\u2019ve rated Act 1 and 2 higher.\nThe First Act is an archetypal journey of The Fool to see the world. All the classics are here. I considered naming the tropes but realised it would spoil parts of the story. It\u2019s not a bad thing, as far as storytelling goes it\u2019s a solid foundation and a decent choice when considering how it\u2019s now necessary to lower the stakes and start anew after Endwalker. Following up events about the fate of the entire universe is tough and either you have to raise the stakes and go save the Universe 2.0 or you need to find a way to lower them to acceptable levels. After all that, making the WoL now do small errands and participate in Eorzean petty squabbles after all that would be silly, so a setting in a distant land as an assistant to an heir to the throne is a fine idea.\nWhat do I think of Wuk Lamat? My initial impression was neutral-positive-ish since we\u2019ve already met in the previous patch content MSQ. Over time she grew on me. She is the Fool in the archetypal journey story. She\u2019s rash, hot-headed, foolish, clumsy, insecure and a bit dumb. All she has is a big heart and willingness to learn. She loves her father, her country and the people of said country. There was only one point where she really annoyed me greatly and it was in the very last trial.\nThe music didn\u2019t let me down. The locations range from okay to amazing. \nI said I was going to try to be fair, so this is the part where I get harsher:\nA couple of very obvious flaws, such as the villains not being very fleshed out and Gulool Ja Ja (The Wise Old King) being really grating to listen to in English. I don\u2019t know what that accent is, but to me it sounds like my bad impression of an American when I\u2019m trying to make fun of Americans. Or when Gintoki in Gintama would try to speak English with an American twang. The ridiculous way he talks doesn\u2019t gel at all with the serious things he says. It\u2019s like if you took the Final speech from the Great Dictator and added *honk honk* between every other phrase. I\u2019ve considered switching back to Japanese VAs just because of him.\nNow, I like the fantasy/role of being the hidden ace, the badass background character in a story, which is what the WoL is in this expansion. But the problem with that is that it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. There are ways to mitigate that and it\u2019s to give the WoL way more opportunities to shine. The occasional acknowledgements like \u201coh that one\u2019s trouble\u201d and \u201coh don\u2019t worry, the scary adventurer won\u2019t pull any tricks\u201d don\u2019t really amount to much. I know they\u2019ve tried, they really did. There were many instances of \u201cyou\u2019ve already dealt with it?!\u201d but as a substitute for actual heroic deeds it doesn\u2019t work. \nAs part of the previous flaw I found that there was TOO MUCH Wuk Lamat. I say that as someone who likes her as a character. And yet there was way too much, I\u2019m completely all Wuk Lamated out and don\u2019t want to see her at the forefront of any events in the near future. Let her stay as a side character ruler like Lyse or Aymeric, who occasionally pop up to say a thing. \nDoing two new DPS at the same time was a mistake. It would\u2019ve been much wiser to have 1 tank, 1 healer and 1 dps, so people could level them at the same time and fill all the roles in the queue. As is, it\u2019s incredibly congested and there\u2019s a constant severe lack of tanks and healers (the second partially due to the \u201chealer strike\u201d). Another reason is that even for those that do want to get their tanks and healer to 100 asap, that\u2019s only 4 jobs on each role and 10 levels. There are other reasons, such as fates, but overall the conclusion is clear, releasing two DPS jobs without tanks or healers was a mistake. \nI\u2019m not super happy about the class changes and additions this time, but I\u2019m not going to rant about that.\nMy conclusion is that I\u2019m positive about the expansion, but in a lukewarm kind of way. I hope it serves as a decent foundation for things to come.\n", "timestamp_created": 1720108080, "timestamp_updated": 1720108080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168981683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090837236", "num_games_owned": 1490, "num_reviews": 351, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice expansion overall, the bigots are hating it because of Wuk Lamat having a trans person as voice actor which is a good reason to buy it and promote it, TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\nAnyway, the new story line is nice, the graphical rework is wonderful, love the new jobs, i recommend it to everyone except the bigots that hate the LGBTQIA+ community for no reason in general, touch grass bigots and let people enjoy the expansion :3", "timestamp_created": 1720107466, "timestamp_updated": 1724300602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168980831", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131645747", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7806, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this so so much!!!

That's it. I don't know who she is, but I am sorry, she ruined it. To me this is the ONLY part where FF14 Dawntrail FAILED to deliver.

her love of peace? okay, but that's also exactly what koana wants. and not be funny, but wanting everlasting peace isn't something that makes someone a good leader. she isn't exactly a coward, so there isn't an arch of her overcoming fears, she has these little quirks like getting sea sick or liking tacos that don't really substitute for a personality. she is, however, nice! and reckless, and likes to get to know people! so it's not that there's nothing, but if you dont find her quirks endearing (i didnt, looks like a lot of people didnt) then you probably aren't going to particularly like her! one of the main themes around dawntrail is this idea of cultural unity, which makes esne, as well as understanding and respecting tradition. i was worrying throughout that they were going to tell me that wuk lamat would make a better leader over koana because of her respecting traditions, over koana wanting technological influence. if that HAD been the case, then dawntrail would have sucked! because that would've been, ironically, a really conservative message! thankfully i do think it treads the line correctly by oberserving the culture of these myriad groups while allowing koana to rule alongside to usher in a new age of progress. i will say, for as much as i found wuk lamat quite frustrating, i did engage with this story, and there is merit to that. it would've helped had we had any significant interractions with the scions at this time, but we're ALWAYS going with wuk lamat. i hardly noticed krile, alphinaud, or alisae at all in the first half of the expansion. after the succession ends, we get to do cowboy hijinks with with erenville which is fun. then the tension starts! dawntrail is very much a two-halfs kind of expansion, and the second half felt like i was playing FF14 again. heritage found, solution nine, and living memories are much more what we expect of this game at this point. there's still some cheesey stuff that doesnt' really make sense, but it works mostly. galool ja overhearing that we want to kill his dad, running away, and then saying, \"actually I want to get to know you\" was all very easy, wasn't it? you introduce a character like otis and i'm like \"this motherfucker gonna die\", same with galool jaja. the cliche of older dad figure who is a warrior HAVING to die is so frustrating. i wish this game didn't lean into cliches as often as it does with character beats, but its fine. galool jaja clears. bakool jaja also clears. discussed with my fiance a lot about how the last three expansions have all had their final areas be some kind of simulation of a memory, as it pertains to grief and death. and while i hope 8.0 abandons this theme for its final area, living memory still worked for me. i respect CBU3 for having the balls to go \"we made this absolutely beautiful, lovely area with gondolas and rides and ice cream... and you have to permanently delete it\". that really rings through the theme of what you're doing knowing you can't* undo it. i particularly enjoyed the stuff with erenville's mother here. and because graha and alisae were actually saying and doing stuff, i didn't mind wuk lamat anywhere nearly as much! her jumping in at the last minute of the final trial to main character the final boss DID annoy me though, like, c'mon, it's the final boss! \n\nuhh gameplay. the instances in dawntrail suck! honestly shocked at this. THREE of them are fighting a two-headed mamool ja, and thats the same one in two of them! the fourth instance is a really annoying ad focused one in solution nine where the tank doesn't group them together so it doesnt have the same cohesion as dungeon combat, so just feels worse? the boss of that  instance summons ads, then the second boss summons too many ads that you're forced into not being able to beat them all. learned helplessness can be cool but when it's just some random creature it just kind of sucks. boring! the dungeons are fine? the only one that really stands out is alexandria, but even then it's not the best or anything. i like the trials! i think it's very cool that zarool ja joins you as a party member for valigarmanda, but then IS the second trial! that's cool! i will say it annoyed me to no fuckign end that you can have NPCs for Valigarmanda and zarool ja, but NOT for queen eternal? i get we use the Azem Crystal but like, you can just make NPCs be wearing the job gear so they feel like generic heroes... like as a someone did this expac as DPS, being able to do all the content instantly, then having to wait over THIRTY MINUTES to get in to the final trial because you decided for some arbitrary reason you can't have NPCs for the final fight is absolutely bonkers. especially in an expac where you released two new DPS characters, so DPS queues are going to be horrific at launch! i just... cannot fathom this decision at all. \"we want to make the game more approachable for solo players... except on this one trial, fuck you idiot\". i think it's also time the MSQ design got a rework. the first half of the expac having us talk to random NPCs to gather information, pick up objects, slay random enemies, i don't know, the formula is running pretty thin here isn't it? surely there's a better way to get us to explore areas without all the meandering involved. especially with the amount of big voiced cutscenes that make these things take a lot longer. i actually skipped cutscenes for the first time in the MSQ. the pelupelu bartering bit was some of the most dire, soul-shatteringly boring gameplay this game has had since ARR i think. sorry, sue me!!\n\nlooking forward to the post game. the two optional dungeons both went VERY hard, easily the best dungeons of the expac. significantly harder casual content this time around which is VERY exciting for the upcoming normal raid and alliance raid series. i'm looking forward to whatever comes next for FF14, i just hope that whatever new characters we get don't get superglued to us again", "timestamp_created": 1720083864, "timestamp_updated": 1720083864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168956175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066032369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "you should play this, it's pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1720083601, "timestamp_updated": 1720083601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168955699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022097954", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 317366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.", "timestamp_created": 1720083067, "timestamp_updated": 1720083067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168954781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027804401", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "possibly the best battle content has been in an expansion launch ever\nalso kbittyyy", "timestamp_created": 1720081967, "timestamp_updated": 1720081967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498575508594512939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168954483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301843832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "different than previous expansion, solid entry into the new series", "timestamp_created": 1720081647, "timestamp_updated": 1720081647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168954312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047451096", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun story, and wonderful voice acting!

Taking your time going through it instead of rushing through is the bread and butter here. If you go into Dawntrail expecting it to be like Shadowbringers or Endwalker you'll be disappointed. Because it's not. I'm kind of surprised hearing that Dawntrail's got mixed reviews because the writing is excellent as usual. CU3 writers do not miss. Dawntrail has so much rich worldbuilding to experience and read about in game. And for once we don't go in another new expansion expecting to kill another elder god or whatever.

A lot of people complaining about the game being to \"shonen\" or even \"woke\" sound like the people getting outraged in 2020 finding out their favorite band RAtM is socialist/communist after listening to them for 10 years. What's worse is some legitimate concerns are getting drowned out due to this such as Jobs feeling to familiar still (which I don't agree with but can see) or end game is to focused on the two minute window (I can see this especially if I still did progression content.)\n\nEDIT: I will add, if you truly finished the 7.0 story you would know it's relation to one of the best FF's, but I can't say more without spoiling it. LOL. It's been killing me that I can't talk about it without spoiling it.\n\nEDIT EDIT: After being able to reflect on it and run it on my alt, there are some moments that are very \"eh?\" Possibly 3 moments. 4 if you include music from one scene (IYKYK) which isn't the music is bad but simply doesn't fit the theme the xpac is going. A major critique is pacing and I will agree with that. Out of 100 MSQ quests, it is roughly 50/40/10, and if it stayed 100 it should of been closer to 35/50/15. The second \"eh\" moment is a 4/10 moment for me. It didn't ruin the xpac, but it was a low point. Mike from Preach Gaming called it a GoT S8 moment for him and I can see that. It definitely does not drag the xpac to not recommended but once you hit it, you understand a bit of the frustration from the community. For me a not recommended is a 5/10 game or lower and Dawntrail is way better than that. Without the story the xpac is amazing. The story has 10/10 moments but there are definitely some 4-6/10 moments there with that last \"eh?\" moment just making me sigh.

As long as you are willing to sit back and watch a tale unfold and not be the center of attention, then this is a lovingly crafted story of growing as a person, adopted family and being true to yourself under great societal pressure.

It starts out with a nice change of pace, as the lyrics to the theme say:\n\nSo, grab hold of today with all your might, The sun is rising. Savor life without rushing, Every single day.\n\nSome of the best \"main series\" dungeon and trial encounter design in the series so far.  Interesting game mechanics.  They stepped up the challenge. Game play 10/10. I don't think I've heard a single complaint about this part of the content.\n\nWhen it comes to the story - I enjoyed it a lot. I think this is what a Beach Episode looks like for the Warrior of Light. She goes on an adventure that is much lower stakes (at least to start) - Dawntrail is how the WoL relaxes. The stakes do change halfway through the expansion, obviously. You aren't driving the action, you are acknowledged as the most powerful person in the room and you are providing support and mentorship to Wuk.\n\nWuk is our constant companion  and she is big orange cat who absolutely loves and wants to see the best in everyone, to a fault. She doesn't start out knowing her own power and is a lot more sheltered - it takes time for her to realize what she is capable of and build her confidence. It's a training arc, in a lot of ways.\n\nIf you enjoy this kind of character and that kind of arc, say if you are a magical girl anime fan, you might just love this expansion. If you absolutely hate that kind of character, you might just be in this expansion for the gameplay and everything except for the MSQ. Heck, she wins with the power of friendship at times.\n\nThe second half of the expansion was when it really got good to me.

Great, even. I'm biased though, I really wanted to explore Tural and they delivered on that front. However the backend of the story shows a trend that has started on patches 6.5, in the sense that instead of a larger plot and story we see episodic adventure jaunts that connect with the reflections of the source, and said plot tends to be condensed to be fully solved and stand alone.\n\nThis expansion was supposed to be the thing to prepare us for 10 years and all I can read as a major plot beat is that.\n\nThis game story thrives on character moments (still present on Dawntrail)  memorable moments (still here) and on going antagonistic forces with arcane plans that slowly peel away. That last one is present still, but rushed to be all neatly done by the end of the base adventure.\n\nWhen it comes to plot, I feel the crew got less ambitious for the next ten years. And it saddens me because even though I enjoyed what I got, it doesn't show the promise to ever get us to the highs and payoffs of a Shadowbringers. Even ARR, the base game story which I like way less than Dawntrail's, had a better set up for the future. Let's hope they fix it on the patch story.\n\nHere's my thoughts on everything else:\nIt is modern FF14 refined, with two fantastic new classes that have amazing gameplay and enjoyable stories. The new battle content I experienced was better than average and I'm impressed how beautiful the new update looks.\nIf you are a long time fan, its an easy recommend. Just manage your spectations for the MSQ.

TLDR first 4/5ths of the MSQ is about an 8, maybe a 7. Last 1/5 is a 3.\n\nI enjoyed my time with wuk lamat, touring Tural and meeting the locals. That part of the MSQ is fun and interesting. It takes a sudden turn for the worst around level 98 in the MSQ and things get ... bad. I enjoy scifi more than fantasy, and all too often people put them together and I don't like it. Really don't like it. And that's what happens at that point. Suddenly scifi, suddenly bad scifi. I won't go into the story but it's rather tropey and the only interesting part of it is krile's backstory. \n\nThen there's the city/zone design. The 2nd city is sprawling and empty. Extremely empty. Tulliyollal feels like there are complete parts of a city put together, the 2nd city doesn't have that. And the final zone is even worse. It's like Azys La but with melancholy music and I hate it. And don't get me started on the guide, I hate her character.\n\nAs for gameplay, the dungeon fights and trials are all pretty great, probably the best FF14 has had. But as a dragoon main, they fucked that shit up. I have gone from 3 jumps in EW to 2 jumps in dawntrail, the rotation is now a spam fest of procs that I try to weave in on ogcds instead of being a coherent rotation that, admittedly was long and had no variation, but was easy to muscle memory. This shit makes me feel like I'm playing dancer for 10 seconds every 30 seconds and then it's back to the regular rotation and I hate it. They gave me this fast move to mob ability and it just feels ... bad ... compared to a jump. Give me my damn class identity back.\n\nAs for music, it's mixed, some good tracks, some good tracks used in places that doesn't feel right, and some stuff I didn't care for. VA performances are great, Wuk Lamat is a big bundle of energy and I can see that grating on people but she's fun.

The expansion DOES hit the nail on the head with some really good dungeons, trials, and raids, so the post-MSQ content that you'll likely be sinking a fair bit of time into is still just as good as the post-MSQ content we've gotten from other expansions. Overall, I do believe Dawntrail to be a good expansion, but if you go into it thinking you're getting something on the same level as ShB or EW, then you're likely going to be somewhat disappointed.

Not amazing, not bad...just good. In terms of lore significance I believe it will serve in the new arc like A Realm Reborn and Stormblood did. That is, advancing the plot by introducing plot points and new lore and not through massive revelations like Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Those with even the smallest media literacy know this; worldbuilding is extremely important when you are building up a large story that seeks to build upon said worldbuilding.\n\nThose comparing this story with the prior two expansions, at least story wise, are simply being disingenuous or dumb. Yoshi P made it very clear what this expansion was going to be, so much so that it was a meme - 'beach episode expansion.' Despite setting that expectation and it being MORE than that, people still complain that it is filler and boring.\n\nThis exposes a large issue with Final Fantasy XIV's community. That being, many of them want constant payoff because most players entered the game when the story offered for the ability of such all whilst completely forgetting that the game has been around for more than a decade and had the means to build up to the payoff that Endwalker had bought.\n\nI would rant that many of XIV's audience are Shonen-heads that can't compute what actual storytelling is but I ain't gonna get started with that.\n\nBesides the story which has been the main point of contention among those that have played it, I think universally the combat content has been loved. I agree with this. The dungeons and trials that were released in the 7.0 patch have been among the greatest ever introduced in the game. The areas too are some of my favourite in the game.\n\nMy main complaints about this expansion are, like many, Wuk Lamat's voice actor, who struggles with yelling and any tone that isn't 'happy.' As a character I quite enjoy her, but I really do think that she is just a better version of Lyse. That meaning she's kind of forced and unlikeable for some reasons. I completely understand the critiques of her. I get its her story, but man. It really is a lot. As for a real critique of the story, a certain small arc in it could genuinely be filler as it serves nearly no purpose to the wider story.\n\nOverall I'll give Dawntrail a 7.5/10. I hope that the 7.X cycle gives more longevity than the 6.X cycle did.\n\nOh yeah and a mandatory note that Soken kicked ass this expansion.", "timestamp_created": 1720056732, "timestamp_updated": 1720056732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168934071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063099180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I very much enjoyed the Dawntrail story.

She has been described as a \"shounen anime protagonist\" due to how the expansion focuses so heavily on her development. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing; she's well written and her voice actor does an excellent job, and as a story about a warrior-princess learning to be a ruler it succeeds with flying colors. However, players who are more interested in stories that focus on their own Warrior of Light or on other characters they've already grown attached to may have trouble appreciating an expansion written with the goal of presenting something entirely new. I can completely understand the viewpoint of those who got tired of her by the end even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nOn the plus side, Dawntrail's scenarios are some of the best the game has ever had. They have complex encounters with novel mechanics and excellent theming, and the soundtrack never fails to get me pumped for combat. I can see myself enjoying these dungeons and trials long after Dawntrail's release. Even if you find that you don't like the plot, you'll get plenty of enjoyment from what the new battles have to offer. \n\nThe new jobs, Pictomancer and Viper, are fun spins on caster and melee DPS archetypes.\nPictomancer uses GCDs (spell casts) to \"paint\" different weapons or effects and then can unleash them when the time is right. They also make use of hotbar buttons that change with each cast on a cycle, rather than having 3 separate actions which is a nice QOL touch. Overall, it has the feeling of playing a slightly more complex Black Mage.\nViper, following in the tradition of other melee dps classes, chains together instant skills into combos to do different attacks. Their main draw is that they can use certain abilities to unleash a burst of damage by combining their two swords into one polearm for a couple combos. It ends up playing as something of a \"chase the glowing buttons\" game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but may lead to it feeling underwhelming after the initial novelty.\n\nOverall I give Dawntrail a 9/10. It doesn't rank above Shadowbringers or Endwalker for me but I would still highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game.

You truly feel excited to get into these dungeons and trials and the solo duties (at least imo)\n\nThe graphics update is amazing and my dragon girl looks cuter than ever 10/10 \n\nThe TILTING MECHANICS are beautiful I love it. \n\nThe music is pretty nice for the zones but there are a few times the scene music just doesn't fit.

This'll take a bit to explain.\n\nThe previous expansion was a climax to a nearly decade long story. This is a proper de-escalation, going back to \"Just Being An Adventurer\" like the start of the game's main story. It builds back up in the second half, but expect it to be overly positive and upbeat for the first 1/3 of the story until the level 93 8-player trial. This could be as much as 20 hours of playtime where the plot is put in low gear before things begin building up for a climax again.\n\nTo translate that into Dragon Ball terms, that would be like Kid Goku who fought bandits growing up, killing Freezer in space, then coming back to earth to fight bandits again. This wouldn't be done in Dragon Ball, but it's certainly done here.\n\nI wouldn't describe this re-entering High Gear until level 96-97 thereabouts, which could be about 40 hours into the story depending on how you play.\n\nFor myself, an individual who LOVES the idea of you being an adventurer, a nobody, taking on the mentor role to Wuk Lamat's journey is PERFECT (IN CONCEPT, not execution). It's just that it really does dilly-dally getting to that first trial. I feel that they could have punctuated those first two zones at levels 90-92 with more local threats, specifically combat encounters to make you feel like you are done a lot more than talking.\n\nBy the time you finish with the first main story arc with Wuk Lamat and you enter the \"save the world\" portion of the story, it doesn't give you sufficient time to get to know certain new characters to make a true emotional connection with them. That second half feels a little rushed. I can't help but feel like that story arc in the second half got rushed in order to give Wuk Lamat's journey in the first half some extra scenes.\n\nThat said, taking the critical cap off for a second, I enjoyed the entire thing and would like more of it.

The story is a well-executed reset, where we put down our \"main character\" hat, and instead get to be party to someone else's trials, triumphs, and failures, mentoring them along the way. Conversely, going into this expansion wanting even higher stakes than the previous one will lead to disappointment. The writers have decided that they want to shelve the old, and slowly grow a fresh new take on what it means to be a Final Fantasy 14 story, and do it in world in a way that respects the legacy of those that came before.\n\nThe work they've done on the technical side of the game to improve quest design makes this expansion easy to enjoy. The artists took full advantage of the new graphics update, featuring a high level of detail in the outfits, facial expressions, and foliage. Prior to gaining flight, the zones feel even larger and more real than they did before, because they're able to use the denser foliage to make it feel as though you're actually winding through a forest, or a mountain region. And while a lot of maps have already featured impressive verticality, the new foliage means that those long-distance vistas are full of interesting things to look at, with different perspectives giving new appreciation for the map design. A tower set among a set of trees simply looks impressive from its base, but then its function in the nearby community becomes obvious when you're up high on a cliff, and see it set into the wider landscape.\n\nThe combination of low (or localized) stakes and the wide variety of music, landscapes, and cultures, makes it feel like this is a summer vacation, where we were invited by the locals to come hang out while nation-wide cultural events take place. It's such a refreshing change of pace from being constantly in fear of the world-ending problems, and possibly losing any companion at any moment.\n\nThe new raids have yet to release, but the existing selection of combat encounters have also been extremely creative. It's nice to see the developers try completely new things, even if they don't stick long-term. It's also nice to see that the new combat encounters give you much stronger negative feedback when a puzzle isn't solved correctly. It all adds to the thrill of exploration, discovery, and learning!\n\nIf there is one thing they could have improved, it would be that they could have done a better job integrating the \"long-term\" plot points into the individual side moments. There are many moments which are ultimately essential to the story, but in the moment feel like they are not yet connected.

Story is actually really good if you play the role of mentor/tourist but falls very flat if you want to play the role of 'international hero'. Dungeons and Trials are literally the best they've ever been, and the music is boppin' as always. Most (not all) complaints are shallow and superficial. There just isn't as much hype to drown them out this expac because an arc isn't concluding.\n\n[h2]Full Review[/h2] (spoiler free):\nI don't normally write reviews. I generally don't care what others think about what I thought of a game, but it saddens me to see this expansion being received so divisively when it's actually good! It's just not avatar-centric like the last few have been. So I'm going to add my voice to the chorus of those who are happy with what this expansion is doing.\n\nThat said, I want to make sure no one going into this is under any misapprehensions. \n\nThe Dawntrail expansion of FFXIV is written with the intent that you will take it slow and immerse yourself in the cultures you visit. If you are impatient, or just want to get to the part where your character does cool stuff, you will be underwhelmed, not because that stuff doesn't exist, but because this story actively punishes that kind of impatience by denying those players meaningful stakes beyond 'stop obviously bad thing from happening'. If you are patient and like world building/travel and don't want to be the super special chosen one for once, you are free to enjoy this expansion, I promise. If you aren't, well, the dungeons and trails are all A-tier at the very least. If that is ALL you care about, you'll probably like it too. If you want a cool \"you're the hero that saves the world\" storyline, you will not find it here. Your role in this expansion is as an advisor/adventurer/tourist, and there are plenty of opportunities for us to fulfill that role and flex our knowledge or prowess, but the only time we're ever treated as say, the only hope the world has, is at the very end of the expansion.\n\nIf you came here looking for some good Scion VS Scion content, you won't get much. But maybe that's a good thing. The Scions (both individually and as a group) really do take a backseat this expansion. Your major characters are Wuk Lamat, Erenville, Krile, and then you. Alphinaud and Alisae are with you because they're needed for trust dungeons and also THEY are the ones doing the truly menial dirty work that people often complain about us having to do while the scions advance the plot. This time, we're pretty much present for the entirety of the plot advancement, even if it advances slowly for the first third of the story.\n\nThis expansion is best thought of as two separate stories, one a sequel to the other, with an intermission in between them. Like what Stormblood should have been rather than its nesting doll of plot threads. You will begin with the advertised rite of succession, on a quest to find the city of gold. The second half of the expansion only happens due to the outcome of the first half, and while I won't spoil anything, I'll admit that the intermission between the two stories goes on for longer than it should, and that the transition into the second story is jarring when it really could have been built up better.\n\nThe second half of the expansion, again without spoiling anything, explores the duties a ruler has towards a nation, and shows how easily those duties can be ignored or abused. There's a bunch of lore drops planted in this half of the expansion, which I assume will be what we follow up on in patch content.\n\nI'd argue this expansion is most like Stormblood, but better paced (not a nesting doll of nonsense) and with more thematically appropriate villains (though I'd hesitate to call either of our endgame villains compelling, an unfortunate similarity they share with Stormblood's big bad, at least as they appear in Stormblood). In fact, our endgame villains are a real low point for me personally, and why I rank the second half of the expansion lower than the first half, where all the villains are much more interesting.\n\nDespite what the not recommended votes may say, you can and likely will enjoy this expansion. Even if the story isn't to your liking, the dungeons and trials certainly will be. Unless you're a complete world-building nerd like I am, it probably won't be your favorite, but it's a solid and enjoyable story that's easy to get immersed in. Something to play for say, half a zone at a time and just chill with. It's a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n(I may or may not come back to edit this for patch content, but I'm fairly confident mine is a take that will endure.)", "timestamp_created": 1720034935, "timestamp_updated": 1720034935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485829949378967285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168908960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020321511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Is Dawntrail as good as Endwalker?

It doesn't reach the heights of Shadowbringers story-wise but it was a very fun and refreshing adventure.\nIt's main \"issue\" is that the story hinges heavily on if you like Wuk Lamat or not, and if you don't, you might have a hard time connecting to the story. Which can happen, Stormblood had this issue with Lyse. But I think it's done way better here.\n\nApart from Wuk Lamat, the themes of understanding and discovery of other ways of life continues from previous expansions, with a lot of South-America inspired cultures, which you rarely see in RPGs, so it felt fresh. And the true theme of the expansion, I won't spoil, but I think was treated fairly well, was emotional and well written.\n\nGameplay-wise it's a continuation and refinement of what Endwalker brought, which might not be enough for some but is overall fine by me.

Combat feels genuinely interesting and engaging, not like a thing you can sleep through which if you ask me is a good sign for things going forward. Furthermore it has some awesome quality of life improvement that feel really good to have now.\n\nThe music has been alright, maybe not as memorable as some of the other ones but it did for good ambiance and a great climax during the third trial.

Endwalker was epic in its scope in trying to give a proper send off the the Zodiark/Hydalen arc. If Yoshi-p had tried to force feed me something with that pacing and scale again so soon, I may have taken an extended break from FFXIV. Instead, we get a much more cozy story with loads of development into the Turali people. Personally, I love that the WoL gets to take a back seat and not have all of the focus and pressure on them every second of every quest, That is just exhausting, whereas DT has been a breath of fresh air. I find Wuk Lamat to be a genuinely likable character and I was invested in the rite of succession story.

She is extremely bland she is just a fun side character at best imo. So even though the take in the scenario where we are in a mentor position is good I just find Wuk Lamat is not a good disciple for WoL.\n\n- Besides that graphics are just the way I'd love it, new textures lightning and style of choice brings your characters so so so much needed life into them! I wholeheartedly believe that. Even though this game is no where near realistic I swear to you, your characters will look photorealistic in certain angles and lights. Like it's really amazing to they managed to create this much life without tempering with the essence of characters. I love the new glams as well very subtly detailed nothing crazy over the top design choices, just simple beauties.\n\n- Lastly the gameplay, I've so far cleared the first new dungeon only and can easily say there are improvements in the challenge of the mechanics in a fun way without making it unnecessarily harder. It seems to be just as yoship described them which is something I highly appreciate. Pictomancer is just as I imagined pure fun gameplay with a unique playstyle. I'm still leveling my viper but thats very fine too. \n\nThere is not much more review needed, new areas, gameplay, graphics are tons of fun with other detailed side content and some I guess not bad but not good story this DLC doesn't falter behind the previous DLC's. Next DLC must obviously increase the tension more hopefully but like I said this is a good pace change.", "timestamp_created": 1720014431, "timestamp_updated": 1720014431, "voted_up": true,

This makes a review to dismantle some of the nonsense of no-recommendators a bit more difficult. There will be very soft spoilers in here, but nothing that isn't obvious by the other reviews and by trailers or the late Endwalker-Patchcontent already.\n\nIgnoring the usual, bi-annually whining about technical issues a new expansion often has unfortunately...\n\n...the whinging about Dawntrails story is hilarious for one simple reason: Some of the negative reviews in this regard are so early on in even the early access period, that they DEFINITELY did not actually watch the cutscenes nor red the questtexts or they would not be able to say anything about even 30% of Dawntrails current content. Even funnier is, that as someone who is through the story, i can tell by what they are saying (and not saying) with absolute certainty, they wrote their hogwash complaint before being through half of it. \n\nDawntrail is two stories. While one obviously is tied to the other and the second act cannot exist without the first, it is a vastly different experience than what those crybabies describe here. And i figure most players, and i assume even the players who finished the expansion and did not enjoy it for other reasons, laugh about these morons and its very justified. They should be made fun of.\n\nThe same goes for people who describe your role in Dawntrail as \"Cameraman\" like some poor fool who i use as a stand in for all the others wrote. In fact you are not the main focus of the story for a majority of Dawntrail. Wuk Lamat is, as the Endwalker Patchcontent already clearly tells you. But its also not like you are not extremely important to that whole storyline. \n\nIt seems like the people complaining much about Wuk Lamat as a character are the people who get tearyeyed about their gross insult to character design, basic-bi* humunculus not being center stage of every cutscene for a spell... That jealousy for attention of story-senpai (uwu) is in my eyes also the only way to explain why a few people describe her as a Mary Sue, when she is really clearly not that. She begins as a rather weak (reading side-character-that-isn't-scions strong), extremely stupid and guillable character that slowly grows upwards (admitting: Slowly for the span of an expansion, which might still feels quick even tho the expansion tries to tell you it takes place over the span of multiple months) to be stronger and thats only thanks to you and the other people helping her out... which is acknowledged multiple times by Wuk Lamat herself.\n\nDawntrail is fun. Its more relaxed than previous Expansions for... a large part of it, because its not an End of the World Scenario as Shadowbringers and Endwalker were... Thats exactly whats on the box, tho, from the first trailer on...\n\nSo don't worry about the negative reviews. Most of them are pretty big nonsense... Its good! Its not the best, clearly. But its far above Stormblood easily and fun to go through. Also the new classes are both pretty cool to play, even tho they make finding dungeongroups a bit lengthy as both are DPS...", "timestamp_created": 1720012043, "timestamp_updated": 1720079354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517647087574005127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168877250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998625608", "num_games_owned": 1086, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 388741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 395, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "great story, great characters, great music, great locations and incredible dungeons and trials. can't wait to see what's next.", "timestamp_created": 1720011528, "timestamp_updated": 1720011528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522340655326843262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168876935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995349647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "MSQ - First half: 3/10\nMSQ - Second half: 6/10\nMSQ Dungeons: 8.5/10\nMSQ Trials: 8/10\nFinal Trial: 10/10 - probably the best normal trial ever\nLevel 100 Dungeons: 8/10\nExtreme Trials: 8.5/10\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\n\nIn general, the story is okayish; this is definitely a filler expansion in terms of the story (Stormblood 2.0).

I wanted to jump in and elaborate that this story was never going to be on the same level as Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Those were solid 10-year build-ups, and DawnTrail is a break into a new storyline after coming out of such insane world-bending highs in those previous two expansions. People who expected more from this going in are kidding themselves, because matching that for a third time in a row would be incredibly difficult.\n\nI also want to say, that if you're a chronic cutscene-skipper like me, this is shaping up to be a fantastic expansion in terms of challenging content. The dungeons and trials have been a VERY grateful step up from the rather dull, casually-oriented battle content of Endwalker.\n\nIn terms of story, it's expectedly better than Stormblood and Heavensward for me, and VERY expectedly not as good as Shadowbringers and Endwalker. The biggest problem I've had is the pacing and how story issues are conveniently solved immediately without build-up, along with a few confusing story elements - overall though, this entry elaborates on some fascinating world lore, has phenomenal new maps, and was a lot more enjoyable than expected. That's saying something for me - I've been playing for 10 years and didn't start paying attention to any story until Shadowbringers, as I found ARR, HW and SB immensely boring. \n\nI moreso play for the mass of interesting and challenging content available than story/lore, so I was pleasantly surprised that I could [mostly] pay attention to learning about the new worlds we find in DawnTrail. Remember, it's okay to skip cutscenes here and there if you're losing a bit of interest. You might miss a couple things, but I'm sure there's plenty of people to fill you in, if there was even anything important there in the first place.

This story will be liked by some people, but for most, it aint for them. It reminds me of old school Disney movies, with for some reason an ending song that would be in The Greatest Showman. Overall, the story is fine. There is more bad than good, but I would still recommend it for those who can deal with the writing. Wuk Lamat is a fine character too, but I do agree that her growth ended too early. The first half of this expansion is your cliche royalty succession story, which has been done over and over by many manga and anime. The second half of this expansion though, is a lot better. There are still some problems, but the music slaps, the cutscene fights are chef's kiss, and the dungeons and trials are amazing too. I will recommend this expansion, but its definitely on the weak side compared to the most, probably experiencing a Stormblood 2: Electric Boogaloo.

Let me just say, I'm a massive fan of story, so I will speak there first.\n\nIndeed, the rumors are true, we definitely take a backseat to this, but they do give us moments to kick ass and take names...even if I sometimes felt like even those moments were...how do I saw...Wuk-ified? \n\nBut, I honestly don't think it ruined it for me, this expansion is the ARR for the new story line after all...We aren't going to do too much epic cool stuff...This expansion thrives off small moments of satisfaction rather than an overall compelling story line. (I stand by that last statement the most)\n\nCharacters? Loved all our old buddies...did i miss not having \"the group\"...yes. But it didn't ruin it for me, even if i was left wanting. New characters? I say I liked them, nothing felt too odd except for random...growth lets say. \n\nDid it give me emotions? Yes. It did. The theme of family is hit or miss, and here, I think it was a well aimed strike. If you don't give a s*it about family, get ready to not understand anything. Read between the lines or grind your teeth in frustration...\n\nOkay...Battle. First, let me clarify I am a tank, so while I didn't die, I definitely felt a increase in difficulty, especially on the first trial. (i did it once with npc blind which was fine...but with other players? How did it all go so wrong?)\n\n I enjoyed the mechanics thoroughly and never felt bored...minus tank dungeon pulls always, as they ever have, seemed a bit mind-numbing, but it was remedied by the dungeon bosses! I did each duty with npcs first, no issues overall. Then did some with people...and boy do you someone with call outs if you got all new people.\n\nFor most, that's the basics of a ff14 review, and so, you may wonder, do I buy it? I'd say yes. The story is engaging enough, probably equal to Stormblood. Should you skip story? If you do, only do that for the first half, as the second gets *so* good, chills, if I'm honest. (We get to be badass, and that vibes with me.) What about battle? Love it, npcs didn't fail me, even if people did, but it was all in the good fun of ff14 wiping and a desperate healer lb3.\n\nFinal results? (i want to rate the story in...first and second chunks for the story skippers.)\n\nStory part one: 5/10, babysit and fetch quests that are equal to ARR in tediousness even if the story is still good in my opinion.\n\nStory part two: 8/10, While we still follow around, we are badass, kickass, and save others, as the Warrior of Light does best, (with some unsettling and tear-jerking in between)\n\nCharacters old: 9/10, only problem was we...didn't get much from them, I feel...not even Krile. They were side-lined as much as us...\n\nCharacters new: 8/10, some...how do i say...convincing arguments were made and kind of just....accepted. Which is boring...I found myself begging to beat some people up and never given the satisfaction...But I did enjoy the characters overall in the end, but definitely not as much as other expansions (Looking at you Shadowbringers....Endwalker...) but it is the ARR of the new arc, so i gave it a bonus 2 points.\n\nBattle: 10/10, Equal to Endwalker, I feel...might be even better if I had more to cross-examine. Makes you feel big brain, no boredom, music is epic, satisfaction overall. (But! I will say Endwalker's story for the battles is more compelling, same with Shadowbringers. But that's not what my \"battle\" score is based on)\n\nAnyways, thanks for listen to me ramble about one of my favorite games. If you get it, again, please don't skip the 97ish content and on, it was worth it. And...enjoy!

Not only that but we're joining someone else for [i]their[/i] story. So while it may seem like this is someone's \"self-insert\", I'd like you to at least see that for every other expansion, [b]we[/b] were quite literally the self-insert for those stories, which is why I see this argument as silly.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the story is fairly slow, which I have to ask; Did you play the other expansions? Did you not see that the other expansions [i]all[/i] had world building too? Personally I loved the first half of Dawntrail and how much world and character building we had, especially since we were thrown into Tural, a new continent completely foreign to us, with new characters [b]and races[/b] we haven't seen. I loved seeing the different cultures, and learning about all the new people and how everything ties in to the overarching story. If anything, the only complaint I have with the story, is that the second half of Dawntrail felt too [i]fast[/i], for reasons I obviously cannot disclose here.\n\nOn top of everything, I think a certain level of expectance was had when it came to DT's content, [i]especially[/i] because of the things that were shown in the Live Letter. If you don't want spoilers for locations or certain characters, do not look at the Live Letters of course. My point is, I think because of these Live Letters, certain people were far more interested in seeing some of the later-game locations (for reasons all too obvious if you've seen the LL), and because of that I feel that some were too eager to get to the end and how the story unfolds with those later areas, rather than the story we have at the start that centres around Tulliyollal. \n\nOverall, I think this expansion is one of the greatest chunks of content introduced to FFXIV.

The second half picks up somewhat but the moment Wuk Lamat makes her entrance it all goes downhill once more.\n\nThe best zone in this game is the western inspired one \"Shaaloani\".. and the only reason for that is because Wuk Lamat isn't present. You actually feel like your character matters again, and the story told in that singular zone about a random bandit leader was more engaging to me than the entire first half combined.\n\nThe story of Wuk Lamat is basically just Lyse, the difference however is that Lyse's character arc in SB was just a small part of the greater narrative of resistance against Garlemald. \n\n+ Combat great\n+ Second part story somewhat good\n+ Zone design amazing\n+ Music = Sokken\n\n- Wuk Lamat\n- First half is just Lyse arc but furry\n- Character writing is worse, nuance in conversations lost\n- Tone somewhat schizophrenic, going from \"Pray cook a dish\" to \"We sacrifice hundreds of children\" without warning in about 2 hours.\n- Once again very formulaic expansion content plan (might be a good thing for some)\n- Power of Friendship and Talk-nojutsu (and food) basically ends every conflict in this expansion.*\n- Despite the marketing material making it look like you are going on an adventure this is not the feel I got, more like working down a laundry list of tasks Papa Gulool gave us.\n\n* Power of Friendship and to some degree talk-nojutsu have always been a part of FF14 but not to this degree. Power of Friendship moments in previous expansion were earned and in some cases literally written into lore how they are possible. Talk-nojustsu was used sparingly as well. This expansion gives no shits and just goes full hog on this. Wuk Lamat *will* get her way no matter what.\n\nTL:DR\nDissapointing story with good combat. Haven't tried all classes yet but the ones I have seem well balanced and fun to play\n6/10\n\nThe reason why I still give it a thumbs down is because Wuk Lamat is so unbearable she somewhat soured the battle content for me...\n\n\nEDIT: [SPOILERS]\n\n'ight I'm dropping this to a 4.5/10. At the time I wrote this review I wasn't entirely done. But after the dragon scene I had to stop playing (literally alt-f4). \n\nWhy was that scene necessary? Oh, so you are telling me Tural, a place that didnt have much connection to the outside world suddenly enters and alliance with Rhad-zhat han mere moments before the final battle? You are telling me Vtra who's people still suffer from the effects of the final days, is willing to abandon his people go to the other side of the world and fight an enemy he knows NOTHING about without a SINGLE scene to build it up? And the cherry on top the fucking Endwalker trailer music? Why? It had nothing to do with the scene. \n\nI don't know who greenlit this scene but fcking hell it sure feels like the writer himself wasnt confident about this expansion so he needed to take from the previous one.\n\nComplete miss CBU3, fcking hell. :(\n\nEDIT\u00b2: [SPOILERS]\n\nThe last zone is absolutely gorgeous.. still doesn't make up for the rest of the story though.\n\nEDIT\u00b3: [SPOILERS]\n\nThe last zone, specifically the conversation between Krile and her parents and everything that comes after adds a lot of plotholes unfortunately.\n\nThe Milalas are from the Source and during the 5th Umbral Calamity they fled to the Alexandrian reflection... then why is Krile's Soul Source level dense? The denseness of a soul isn't hereditary, else Varis *Emet Selch's son* would have been Ascian level powerful but he wasn't. \n\nMeaning Krile's soul should be as dense as that of a reflection's soul but it isnt else Y'shtola would have realized that by now. \n\n*IF* we take this as a retcon to how souls work than it's still wrong. The Milalas left during the 5th Umbral Calamity, as such they are 5 times rejoined while the rest of the source now is 6 times rejoined, again Y'shtola should have seen a difference...\n\nEDIT ^4:\n\nI'm changing my review from negative to positive.

The second half picks up the stakes and certainly comes off stronger for it. Being an all-new area and such means there's no pre-existing investment like there was with Endwalker, though, so anyone expecting the same level or amount of payoffs will probably be disappointed.\n\nBoth the normal difficulty and extreme bosses are some of the most interesting in the game, gameplay-wise. Even some of the regular dungeon encounters had things happening that took me by surprise and the main story bosses felt much faster-paced and exciting from a gameplay perspective than Endwalker's.\n\nJob changes seem to be a mixed bag. Having only really played Monk and Gunbreaker so far I appreciate the removal of damage from GNB's gap closer so that it can be used to close gaps without feeling like a waste, but Monk feels like it wants a finer pass, as there are some odd quirks from the changes to the numbers, such as Tornado Kick being useless before you get Phoenix Rising and AoE as a whole being weaker because of the removal of Disciplined Fist despite single target being stronger.

While it is by no means unique, I personally have needed a sweet and simple story like this in recent times. One area where I think the messaging needed improvement was how heavy-handed it was. The time spent repeating the same message to hammer it in is time they could have spent better, like spending more time with underutilized characters. \nThe focal point of this story is the character Wuk Lamat and you spend most of the MSQ with her. I personally liked her as a character but I still think that the time alotted to different characters could have been split slightly more evenly. If you do not like Wuk Lamat, then you will probably not enjoy MSQ too much. Another group I think is involved too much is the original cast of the Scions. While I expect that every expansion is still going to contain them to some extent, I was hoping that them disbanding would mean they would show up as individual characters in a bigger cast instead of as a group. However, this was already advertised before launch so I expected it.\n\nNew Areas\nI really like the new areas in Tural. They are very varied and colorful and I have had fun exploring them. I do not have much more to say as of now as I have mostly focused on MSQ.\n\nNew Classes\nI have decided to play Dawntrail as a Pictomancer after previously mostly playing Red Mage through all expansion MSQs since I started playing last year. I have enjoyed Pictomancer quite a bit. While Red Mage is mostly a relatively straightforward and fun class in terms of building resources and spending them as well as great freedom of movement, I have found that Pictomancer requires a bit more forethought. All oGCDs and all GCDs with no cast time are tied to building resources. You either have to have your Canvases prepped for the Muse spells or have built up Paint from continuing your filler GCDs. Both are required for good burst phases AND for situations where you may have to be consistently on the move, which are more common in Dawntrail.\nI have not had the opportunity to try Viper. I only have one criticism: Adding two DPS classes has made queue times rather long. I ended up playing mostly Duty Support both for leveling and MSQ.\n\nNew Dungeons/Trials:\nThe basic dungeons and trials have more hectic mechanics in the sense that there is a lot more time based overlapping aoes or special aoe patterns you need to remember. It's honestly fun even though some of them are a bit of a pain because you can get insta-killed easily by some of them if you make mistakes. All that is naturally a part of learning the patterns and such so that in itself wasn't really a problem. However, it can be quite boring on Duty Support, if there is a specific mechanic you are struggling with that has you restart the fight over and over.\n\nOverall I would personally recommend Dawntrail. However, if you do not think you will like MSQ based on what you know now, and if the other points are not big selling points for you, it may be wise to wait until future patches before purchasing.", "timestamp_created": 1719994648, "timestamp_updated": 1719994648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499843001365661621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168859135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244683362", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't cried this much at a game in a long time.

Each zone was unique and stood out from previous expansion in a way that you can tell which is which despite some looking the same (great detail to vegetation).\nDungeons and Trials are easily the best in the game.\nGreat challenge in the Trials. Yoshi P was being serious when he said he wanted it to be less stress free. Got multiple party wipes in the second trial despite doing with other players.\nWuk Lamat feels a very natural fit for the story. What she learns in the first half, she continues to use them in the second half really showing her growth and the story is mostly about her. Definitely doesn't feel as shoehorned as Lyse in Stormblood.\nSecond half is the strongest part of the expansion in the story. The stakes feel just right giving me Shadowbringers feels.\n\nSome of the valid criticisms I've seen are:\nWuk Lamat is with you for a bit too long, especially during the second half.\nMore voiced cutscenes.\nRepetitive MSQ patterns that probably needs newer or improved styles (given area, find and talk to these people).\nSome things that could've been solved easily if our WoL didn't just stand there, especially after all the things we did in our journey\n\nMy own personal nitpicks (Very very light spoiler):\nI didn't like how the two trials I've done had NPC Trust to do with. It removes the uniqueness that was the second trial in Endwalker and the emotional and gameplay impact I had. I think this is also where I felt that Wuk Lamat was there with you for a bit too much. Having the WoL show their power would feel much more satisfying in showing their strength to Wuk Lamat and other competitors as to who they're competing with.\n\nBasically for me it's like this for me now\nSHB > EW > HW = DT > SB > ARR\n\nA great expansion, knowing the fact that it won't reach the heights of EW and SHB only because it's the start of a new journey.", "timestamp_created": 1719985551, "timestamp_updated": 1719985551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827164173126221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168851799", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066079720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The Story is basically ARR but a Dash of Stormblood, Anyone thats complaining that we are not getting a Deep storyline as Endwalker and Shadowbringers after ending a 10 year+ storyline probably don't know how starting arcs that deep work.

I'm not fully through the story yet, still in the 97-98 range, but what I have played through has compelled me to comment.\n\nFirst off, this expansion's story is a huge shout out to RP'ers, both those who publicly rp in the game, and those who simply tell private stories with their friends. The arc of the WoL as a protagonist, from ARR to now, has gone through so many twists and turns, bumps in the road, sorrows and triumphs, that the fact that your character is not the primary focus of the story feels... RIGHT. Last expansion was literally an end-of-everything style apocalypse plot! There was no where left to go in terms of insane power creep save for falling down the same mistakes that so many stories plotted without an end do, introducing the next \"Bigger Bad that was Totally The Real Threat All Along\" ad nauseam until the playerbase faded away. \n\nInstead, the story sits down and acknowledges your accomplishments. Even while going to a distant land that your character is a relative unknown to, the dichotomy of newcomers meeting and sizing you up for the first time, and those who know you and what you have done, makes the world feel immersive and real. Rather than forcing your character to contend with ever larger and more ridiculous narrative threats, it examines the sole hero narrative, placing you before trials that you, the Warrior of Light, Savior of... well, everything, can absolutely take head on, but pose a threat to others who are not legendary heroes in the same way. You are one person, and you can't be everywhere at once, no matter how powerful. But you aren't alone. \n\nOne of the main focuses of this story is on the connections that people forge, even where walls of culture, technology, and social standing rise between them. The supporting cast in this expansion is some of the strongest yet, reoccurring characters displaying the years of development they have received, and your character taking on a mentor role to newer characters joining us for the first time. These characters, old and new, look up to you, both as a supernatural and terrifying force of destruction that you must be as an MMO protag with over a decade of content behind you; and as a person, one who has been through all the hardships the world has thrown at them, and come out scarred, older, wiser, and most importantly, choosing to remain kind. \n\n(Obvious caveat to the above, the story is written with the assumption that the story in your head matches, or at least follows the major beats of, the story being told by the game. It is an MMO, there can only be so much variation/branching in the story, so it may feel a bit off if you are writing your Warrior of Light as LordDarknessEdgeMurder. But that's not really something the writing team can account for :P)\n\nChanging streams of thought, the gameplay so far has been excellent. There has been a total of 1 new dungeon I found a little lackluster, while the lvl 97 dungeon is easily one of my favorite in the game as a whole. The one trial I've done was a blast, especially going in blind and playing in voice chat with friends. The graphics update, while not strictly connected to this product, is beautiful.\n\nOverall, a big recommend from me.", "timestamp_created": 1719977513, "timestamp_updated": 1719977513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168844802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091792127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "okay i will admit my first review cam after a day of reading the text. so let make my opinion claer. the story is great in the first place. second  mid is okay. the last part is great. still working on after story stuff so got nothing to say. proably need more voice cutcenes in future dlc, both viper and pictomacer are worth it.(in my opinion). but rember this story is right after endwalker so can hard to beat that story in full", "timestamp_created": 1719977501, "timestamp_updated": 1720118721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168844591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078326840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um \u00f3timo primeiro passo para uma nova jornada em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com A Realm Reborn.\nNa primeira metade da hist\u00f3ria, o ritmo \u00e9 lento para introduzir os novos elementos de um novo mundo que veremos nos pr\u00f3ximos patchs, e a \u00faltima metade da hist\u00f3ria introduz novos t\u00f3picos para a pr\u00f3xima d\u00e9cada da hist\u00f3ria do jogo, que introduz elementos familiares e interessantes.

I will be going on tangents here, so the review might be super incoherrent - clear signs of my impending dementia and possible shizophrenia. Might contain referencial spoilers but, honestly, by the end of this, due to the questionable structure and obscure writing of this review, you will have forgotten it anyway.\n\nI both like and dislike Wuk. I like her because she is that 'genki' kinda gal that has that 'rush B' mentality but she definitely needed development. Some crisis or deep conflict to push her forward as a character but all her 'challenges' were done and forgotten in 20 minutes, making me believe that she is either deus ex machina or the writers needed to combine all PG-13 shounen protagonists of the past 10 years into one. \n\nWuk aside for a second, lore dumps were real - adventuring was not. The writing literally was offensive. Offensive to my below average troglodyte brain as I not only get the same information presented thrice but, when prompted to do a quiz about it, even get blatant hints (read: solutions) as to which one is correct. I also do not have faith in the average playerbase of an MMO but, for the love of god, it is, as they say and as it was advertised 'A. NEW. BEGINNING.' - Be at least THAT daring.\n\nAside from that, you got \"Empire strikes back\", \"The Emperor's New Groove\", Xenogears, with a touch of Naruto. I'd say El Dorado but they took the fun out of that as people have already seen it, apparently. Every zone is a hyperbolic time-chamber for the main character and by the end Son Goku easily can tank more damage than you, Heal more than you and out-dps you by spamming her AoE-rotation. So much so that, when getting literally kicked out of the Matrix, she wills herself back in and, in turn, even destroys Windows Firewall apparently. The tribal princess is so gifted in a technology she has superficially seen for a total of an hour that she literally did become Hackercat when required. Again, Hyperbolic time-chamber zones... \n\nGerman VAs were nice, Llama Tea included. Towards the end, the janitor got to speak a character which is probably due to funding problems after literally saving Squenix from financial ruin single-handedly. A memorable performance worthy of a 'new beginning'. Speaking of, the entire story might have been written by mediocre movie-buff chat-GPT. Which... given Squenix still holding on tight to pyramid-schemes like NFTs and scams like genAI, the possibility is non-zero.\n\nThere are pacing issues. There are lots of inconsistencies. There is no player agency story-wise and if I had the option, I'd wear the 'I rather be someplace else'. badge with pride. Then again, I would have missed out on Grandpa Cat who was genuinely funny in delivery. It feels like the entire first half of the Expac might have been planned as some kind of Post-expac MSQ with the 2nd half being a very compressed and condensed actual expac. It would explain why the first half feels rushed. It would explain why the 2nd half gets traction but was over before it has begun. Either that or someone cut out 50% of the actual first half and just tacked the 2nd half onto it with nanofiber threads.\n\nPeople also say that this is a new beginning. It is a beginning that wrapped itself up by the end of the expansion. There is one unspecified glowing Bad Dragon toy with weird markings on it that has not yet explained but we essentially did a Tural 100% speedrun, no major glitches. It proves that having some form of Cognitive Dissonance is vital to uphold the status of the absurd and make for a solid peace of mind on shaky foundations.\n\nTo say some good things: Dungeons and Trials are baller. Music is just banger after banger after banger. Classes are fine unless you are a cynical mid-thirties yearning for a time long past - Classic is coming eventually.

There's a whole lot more going on in the world than just Wuk Lamat, and I'll be honest even if the story started off a little slow it snowballed really hard into having a lot of intrigue. Now granted I'm not through the story as a whole yet so I can't say for certain but I can say:\n\nI think Wuk Lamat is a compelling character, I know there's a lot of people who are being pissy about her because the voice actress is atrans woman, of course no one will actually come out and say that. (And of course I'm not saying everyone who has a negative opinion on the game is that way, just there are some people that are like that.) But I think she did a very good job of selling being a likable naive character. I do think she struggled at carrying scenes that involved her appealing to a the larger narrative but when she was in personal conversation with people I could absolutely see the charm of the character.\n\nIt might seem like there you're just babysitting Wuk Lamat at first, and yeah I can see how that can get a little boring, I had a couple of moments where I was bored too. But I don't really agree at all that this expansion is at all bad, Wuk Lamat's story isn't enough to carry the whole expansion, but pretty much from the start they start putting down other plot threads and curiosities for the player as long as you're paying attention. And avoiding major spoilers, the whole Dawnservent side of the story only lasts for about half of the expansion, after that everything starts to open up and those little plot elements start paying off.\n\nSo yeah, overall I can somewhat see where people are coming from, and I do think there are some parts of the story that are boring/underdeveloped/ect. But I feel like there's a good chunk of negative reviews that are just being haters, or just didn't actually pay attention to the story.\n\nI think overall this is a decent expansion, it's met my expectations thus far, and I'm looking forward to playing more.", "timestamp_created": 1719974897, "timestamp_updated": 1719974897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500959694385528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168841291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043214128", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 321207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 374, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bit of a slow start, but much like ARR it's necessary for setting up everything for the future.

A new character takes the main stage and we are as mentors. While imperfect it's very wholesome. It's pretty unique compared to what we've seen so far in 14. I'd say it's quite controversial too. It had a really slow rough start with many issues but it improved massively later in the last two zones. It's not for everyone and I appreciate the fact that they're trying things. They aren't risking much really but it's more than they used to. And for the lore nerds there are so many implications of things that could potentially happen that thinking about it is quite exciting.\n\nThe combat design is massively improved, though fights are a bit spongy and the new jobs are lovely. Overall worth experiencing for new players and veterans alike. \nThe new instanced content(normal modes, to be precise) is greatly improved. The first two trials were lovely with some new and creative mechanics, the leveling dungeons became faster and more engaging, while keeping the difficulty not too high for your average player.\n\n I didn't like the optional dungeons because they were overdone, some fights had unclear telegraphs, at times the camera would be harder than the boss itself, while other just depended too much on their server ticks not being so bad. This one fight in particular isn't *hard* but it's not enjoyable when you have to think about how things would be seconds ahead of what is on your screen in order to clear. It's not a unique thing but the problem is much more obvious with this type of mechanic. Unless they somehow fix that issue I don't believe such a mechanic belongs in the game.\n\nThe new graphical update also improved things quite a bit, while barely touching performance and adding DLSS&FSR, although poorly for now. If fixed DLSS could be a great addition to the game. The ugly green filter is pretty much gone and thank god.

I don't understand the complaints against Wuk Lamat...she grows as a character and that's the whole point of any storytelling. We help her grow and learn more on her journey.\n- The cultures portrayed are rich and detailed.\n- So far the storytelling has been mostly light-hearted and fun which was expected, and is enjoyable.\n- I enjoy the music, I think it's interesting compared to past expansions, there is quite a few remixes of older music, but there is some new jazzy tunes which are cool. There is one specific song that reminds me a bit of Studio Ghibli which I love, it's very calming.\n\nI'll update this review more when I have more to add.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1719955980, "timestamp_updated": 1719955980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168822875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432306901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "DawnTrail is a breath of fresh air from the last two expansions we had.

I highly recommend this expansion for just how much love went into this. <3", "timestamp_created": 1719955947, "timestamp_updated": 1719958360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168822282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007739156", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 208999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1960, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, amazing expansion.

If you're upset you're not the main part of the story: I'm sorry but that's honestly been tiring for the past 2 expacs.\n\nIf you're upset Krile wasn't a bigger part of it? I get it. And that's valid.\n\nIf you just don't like Wuk Lamat, I understand, but also think you're wrong. But I won't say you HAVE to like her (i'll meme about it, but take it in stride, it's like saying someone HAS to hate pineapple on pizza or something. No one takes those people seriously)\n\nThis is our vacation arc, our mentor arc, and our One Piece arc. I hope you enjoy it. And if not, hopefully you'll enjoy something in the future. Sadly, they cannot make EVERYONE happy with the story. There are people who think any part of the FFXIV expacs are bad. I personally hate Heavensward. I think it's the worst. Some people love it. I honestly liked Shadowbringers the best, Stormblood after, and Endwalker after that. And so far, I really like this one. I'm not done, I have heard the ending is rushed, but if it's less rushed than Endwalkers, so be it.\n\nEnjoy yourselves. and if you're not enjoying it, maybe find something else to play instead.

Her story and development are very engaging, and I enjoyed every moment supporting her journey. She will definitely be a pillar in the coming expansions, and I can't wait to see how she further develops. Its definitely a change going from saving the entire universe in Endwalker to supporting Wuk Lamat on her journey, but it is a welcome change. Its nice to only have the weight of a country on our shoulders, and not the entire world for once. It is a very relaxing expansion overall, but with enough actions and drama to keep it interesting.\n\nWhile the amount of new information reminds me of A Realm Reborn, it improves from that in every way.

Even as someone who has a soft spot for the character in question, I won't deny the first... 10-15 hours is an ARR-level slog. Obviously beginning of a new arc and all that, but I think a lot of people underestimated how much of a slog it was going to be, especially if you're rushing through the story as much as possible to avoid spoilers.\n\nThat being said though, the second arc is masterful, and brought me to tears more than Endwalker ever did. Lots of emotional payoff, some tear-jerking moments, and enough character/world lore to keep me theorising for a long time.\n\nAll of this, punctuated by Soken and the sound team cooking even harder than ever before (Who'd ever think Yakuza and Monster Hunter music would go hard in an FF14 fight?), and some of the best encounter design we've had for several expansions. Dungeons are actually spicy now, and every single trial fight currently in the base game would be a top 10 entry in their own right. \n\nIf I had to offer my own personal criticisms, I'd prefer to see more action between the setpieces like dungeons and trials, and I do think the quest design is due an overhaul. I like the heavy emphasis this game places on storytelling, but sometimes it can get a bit tedious when there's nothing to fight for over an hour.\n\nOverall, with all this considered, I'd probably rank it a 9/10 overall, with a heavy emphasis on \"It has a very slow start and takes a while to get going\". Personally clears Shadowbringers for me in terms of story, and Endwalker in terms of encounter design, but as a whole package, I'd probably place it second, below Stormblood.", "timestamp_created": 1719943130, "timestamp_updated": 1719943130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496521264314651489", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168805950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025135408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Early access player here.\n\nIt is never easy to scale back after a big, epic finale. Endwalker saw the end of a decade long saga of loss, betrayal, renewed hope, and worldbuilding. We went from being just another scion to a true Warrior of Light, repelling invaders, ending ancient conspiracies, liberating entire nations, saving parallel worlds, then saving existence. Naturally, we wondered where we'd go from  there.\n\nNone of us thought we'd go on vacation, and help a fledgling princess claim her throne.\n\nThere's been no small amount of controversy over the writing of Dawntrail. It's certainly more comedic and lighthearted, for the most part, than most of FFXIV. While I can sympathize with this viewpoint that we're 'babysitting Wuk Lamat' after a decade's worth of buildup, this is merely the start of a new arc. Besides, the new cast of characters have been nothing short of fantastic and likable. The worldbuilding is wonderful, providing a unique setting among fantasy media. Tural is vibrant and full of life, in no small part due to the graphical updates. And the story has it's fair share of surprises, hidden from view until the end...\n\nIn regards to combat, it still feels as good as ever, although healers seriously need some more attention, love, and care from the development team. I do not feel adding two DPS jobs for Dawntrail was the right call, as much as I enjoy the role. Warrior also still needs a serious rebalancing, a complaint I've held since Endwalker. I understand what the job is supposed to bring to the table, but maybe it should have less tools to keep moving without a healer. And I'm saying this as a tank main, myself.\n\nOverall, fantastic expansion, and can't wait to see where this new story arc goes.", "timestamp_created": 1719943126, "timestamp_updated": 1719983871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491507261991500854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168805531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821661690", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 448198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10975, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "skip the entire story, dialogue is cringe marvel dribble now, u aint missing anything. exs are fun so far and thats really all that matters. if u arent a raider unlucky ig.", "timestamp_created": 1719942805, "timestamp_updated": 1719942937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415998518466949463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168805282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076412661", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 601126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6088, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is mid.

As for the content iself, In my opinion, this turns out to be the best expansion we've had on FFXIV, because even though some leveling dungeons aren't as great as Stormblood's, the Trials are amazing and the Expert dungeons finally feature fun mechanics, more akin to Normal and Alliance raids.\n\nInstead of introducing yet another layer to the original story arc \u2014 which is what Dragon Quest X latest expansions unfortunately keep doing ceaselessly \u2014 we've been granted a broader look on worldbuilding and new side characters get a good amount of screentime. The latter half of the expansion builds a great stage that gives meaning for the characters introduced in the \"adventuresque\" first half, and even antagonists that could easily have been left behind get to take part. The maps are a breath of fresh air, the BGMs are great and the numerous throwbacks to FF8, FF9 and FF11 hit like a love letter.\n\nNow, while this may not be the worst expansion some are claiming it to be, it is surely the one with the most insufferable amount of soulless complaints.

We are just an Adventurer now, albeit a super strong world savior kind of adventurer.

I found the story to be heartwarming at times and genuinely a nice good feelings adventure without a lot of the heartache we've grown to know in the past main stories. It is a fun expansion and very much more like an island vacation.\n\nFor combat and the like, to my disappointment many things stayed the same or got easier. If you look around, its no mystery people are upset with this as well. Though there seems to be a promise of things getting better as we progress to things like Savage or Extreme trials so I'm not going to give up hope in the combat of this game. So far even the normal trials and some dungeon bosses have truly just made me think and thats something I can't say for most expansion bosses. I'm typically one shotting and maybe dying once every other new dungeon I clear. Partially due to my focus on the rotation of the new job Pictomancer, but also because I do think they put care to give us some more interesting mechanics.\n\nAs far as I know, the two main concerns many people have in this story is the main story and how combat is. To my best ability to explain it, its alright. You're not going to be receiving a revolutionary expansion by any means, but you're not receiving a poor product.

However there is some flaws. [spoiler]The dungeons Origenics and Alexandria are 2 such examples, where they seem to close the player off from progression, forcing you to deal with enemies in smaller packs. Also who ever thought up the Origenics Automatoise as an enemy needs mental help, an unstunnable enemy with giant circle AOEs is not fun, but it only shows up once so I'll let it slide.... for now[/spoiler]\n\n[h3]Music | Rating 9/10[/h3]\nThe music here is **Chef's Kiss** Sublime, and I thought it was a treat, only two instances was it well..... I'll leave it behind spoilers [spoiler]The PeluPelu area had some of the most grating music in my opinion, so I will leave it at that, but also as much as I love Tuliyollal's Jazzy music, it made a couple scenes laughable cause as soon as a super serious cutscene finished, I got the hyped up jazz which made me piss myself laughing[/spoiler]\n\n[h3]Environments | Rating 8/10[/h3]\nThe first 3 areas, are as most reviews say [spoiler]Forests, but tbf, most areas in FFXIV could be seen as one environment, rather SE have decided to take focus on heritage and the people's backgrounds, styling there homes appropriately, I don't think people could expect these people to live in Volcanos like the Milalla or underwater like the Kojin. That's why SE had to focus on their homes than their surroundings as a whole. The three after that, are quite the spectacle's and I'm very happy with that, especially since it's a fucking COWBOY AREA! WOOOOOOOOOOO[/spoiler]\n\n[h3]Story | Rating 5.5/10[/h3]\nNow this is sadly where the Expansion loses its charm, we did not expect going into this to be as good as Endwalker, maybe even Shadowbringers, but we had our hope. FFXIV players love these games for story, while others care more for gameplay, I care for both of these things, so seeing the story flop so hard is sad, I won't go much without spoiler tagging it though, just know this, if you only enjoy FFXIV for the story, maybe wait for the expansion to go on sale. [spoiler] Right, let's get down to this, yes the expansion is slow to start, 90-94 quests are slow as the game more focuses on world building, which I get, this is taking the same approach as ARR, focusing on trying to set us up for something bigger and an overall new adventure, and when we're revealed that new threat, I was very excited about it, in fact the story does move at what feels a faster pace, but this faster pace comes with a lot of plotholes, I will put these plot holes spoilered at the bottom, but those are by what I can remember. And some parts did feel like padding, where FFXIV expansions do have padding to learn how people live, this padding was way too much. And I won't dwell on this too much, but the end area, as emotional as it is, I didn't feel as much sympathy as I did for these Memories, I cared more for Krile and Erenville as they said farewell to constructs dear to them, but that's it, my main thing was why  we should do this if we're at risk of destroying the Source, I'm sorry, but lets focus on saving the world rather than socialize. And lastly, Wuk Lamat, I totally get people's opinions on having Wuk Lamat being a secondary Main Character, but come on, we knew that. I do wish we had more time with the other Ex-Scions, but I get why we didn't cause we've had ARR/HVW/SB/SHB/EW to get to know them, so I understand why this was the case, but I would prefer if more time was put into Bakool Ja Ja's Redemption or learn more about major side characters.[/spoiler]\n\n[h3]Plot holes[/h3]\nRight, so there's a few major plot holes I don't understand how slipped by without being thought of how to answer:\n[list]\n[*][spoiler]It is stated that the flow of time in the Dome flow's differently because of Reflection's different perceptions of time. So the problem is, the people of Yyasulani experienced 30 years while in the dome before we showed up, so doing some rough math, it took 2 days for us to repel Zoraal Ja's attack, upgrade the train and infiltrate the Dome, so if they experienced 15 years in a day.... The math goes way too weird, but it causes so many issues I feel need to be answered.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Who is Gulool Ja's mother, and why did Zoraal Ja have a kid when he's made it clear he has no need to have a kid or want to either. Also How did he, they made it clear he's the only Mamool Ja in that realm, so how did he find another Mamool Ja to make one?[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]So the Key Zoraal Ja opens the door to Sphene's realm, but why doesn't it take Zoraal Ja to Living Memory instead of Solution Nine, like maybe Sphene transported him to Solution Nine after, but she could only transport by memory, not body.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Hopes for Patch Content and Next Expansion[/h3]\nSome of these hopes are spoilers so I will spoiler them\n[list]\n[*]Major one, please answer the plot holes above, they feel necessary to be answered\n[*][spoiler]Show a proper redemption of Bakool Ja Ja[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Reunite the Scions against the upcoming threat, I'm sure the next expansion can't be as chill as before (We have no known new threat, but I'd like to see us all back together), so I hope we can get the gang back together, maybe with some [/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Now that Erenvile has the hopes of living on his Mother's hopes to travel the world, I hope he can join the main group, I know he wasn't taught in combat, but it's my hope for the patch content that he starts trying to learn, picking up the bow just like his mother used to[/spoiler]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1719932762, "timestamp_updated": 1719932762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168788973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059170994", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 135220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5312, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "More like Peak Trail amiright", "timestamp_created": 1719931598, "timestamp_updated": 1719931598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496062994003295898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168788679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295464779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "polish", "review": "The story may be slow but it has its own unique vibe.

Not only the story is an amazing refresh from 'world end class danger' to 'lets go to an adventure' (that we have since shadowbringers), but also dungeons/trials has mechanical stakes now (just read the info message on middle of screen / look at arena and you will solve all of it, but if you fail they are finally doing some damage).\n\nMy only two complain are: \n> the scions still appears too much (but since they also sell some volume it was predicted that they would show up), I just wished they showed up a little less and instead give us new characters / new group. \n> While the new bosses designs are fun, I still dont like the 2min meta / homogenisation of jobs on same role\n\nBesides those two complains, everything else felt fresh and its indicates that the post expansion content will be fun to play.\n\n\n\nTo people complaining about MSQ: We finally got an adventure that we were missing since Heavensward (the award winning expansion that we use to sell to new players). If you are complaining because 'my favourite scion didn't had the deserved screen time' or 'the story is not focused around my character' welp too bad, but we already had the last  2 or even 3 expansions like that so its refreshing to just experiment new stuff and get along with it.\n\nTo people complaining about difficulty / battle content: this is a video-game, if even with trust system you are not able to complete a dungeon/trial maybe then you should learn how to play the game (?) or instead just ask for a friend to carry you (?) or even maybe just watch the msq online instead. The thing is, the vast majority of Endwalker patches after the base expansion release was... boring to say at least. You were barely punished for any mistakes and there were barely any new mechanics to learn. Now if you are one of those players that doesn't like video-game or use ffxiv just like a forum (chat all day and don't actually do battle/crafter/gather content), then just wait a month until the raid gear is here and the other players will carry you through the MSQ.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1719926281, "timestamp_updated": 1719926281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498825579881668091", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168779889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080478264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the world building and music!

Has the same pros and cons as before for anyone coming back. Story dials it back a lil bit like it should, while mechanics for group fights are way more interesting this go around. \n\nThe expansion is worth it if you know you like 14 already and can deal with the same quirks. More details below but so far it's been great. I wouldn't say Shadowbringers/Endwalker level but the game has to have a soft reset at some point.\n\nFor people that want more information.\n\nStory: It's a great overall story, but does still have the FF14 problem of a lot of teleport, talk, teleport, talk. One of the new characters also takes a lot of the protagonist spot light and I see a lot of complains about that, but I like playing mentor. Besides that its still your Final Fantasy grand adventure.\n\nGroup Content: The biggest change I've noticed so far is group activities feel far more fun. Granted its still new, but boss mechanics are a lot more interesting. New markers, game has more ways to help you deal with mechanics so it can give you new stuff basically. It's by far feels like this expansion might be gearing to be more game play rather than story oriented. I fell in love with the trails, can't wait for savage.\n\nNew Jobs: Viper and Pictomancer are both fun, but not revolutionary. Viper is great for people that want a fast but easier end class. Picto is harder since you need to plan around your abilities and store your spells basically on canvasses. Both don't feel bad to play.\n\nJob Changes: I've not messed with all the class changes but Astro rework feels great. Sage's new abilities are also sorta what we always wanted. More damage buttons (I think all healers got new damage abilities?) and an AOE Kardia buff that is really fun to use if you like playing Green DPS like me. \n\nZones: Zones are still stunning. You can still expect the same quality in visual appeal to the past two expansions.\n\nPost Game: So far endgame is the same? I've not researched if there is any changes but tomestones are still a thing. Extreme trails still drops weapons and accessories. Crafting feels like there is a lot more gear but I'm only like level 92 on my crafters so. All the stuff you expect is there for expansion release.

Yes, there are times where it's fetch quest heavy, but you're playing a JRPGMMO, which has always been and will always be fetch quest heavy. There will be times where what you are doing feels asinine and redundant, but sometimes to understand the world, you must explore. \n\nWuk Lamat is a character that I relate to on a very personal level. Trying to hide her flaws and weakness behind bravado is very familiar territory and I think a lot of people who play this (and leave negative reviews with no real constructive feedback) miss the opportunity to see what she is: real. She's not infallible, she doesn't have all the answers, but she tries to see the best in everyone, and will do anything to make sure that her dream is realised, but while walking beside her family, friends and people. She is what a ruler should be: brave, determined and kind. \nYes, this game gets political, but the game has politics in every expansion:\n- ARR had the Garleans vs Eorzea. \n- Heavensward had the Church vs State arguments.\n- Stormblood is an all-out war.\n- Shadowbringers has the Crystarium vs Eulmore.\n- Endwalker is basically the Scions vs Sharlayan and then the invasion of Garlemald (even for the sake of peace). \nWe have always had politics in this game, and when people were hyped for Dawntrail, did they miss the fact that the 6.55 quest have Wuk Lamat tell you that she is vying for the throne?!\n\nThe game has it's flaws, much like all of us, but if you give it a chance and look to the deeper messages that are sprinkled through the story, there is so much rich depth in this, the zones are beautiful and colourful, the characters are inventive and funny, and the dialogue and growth is so warming. \nBe patient, this game ages like fine wine, and personally, I'm so excited to see where we go next!", "timestamp_created": 1719919856, "timestamp_updated": 1719919856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168772508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023352806", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 186174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 172, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "(Spoiler free) I would recommend this even for veterans of the game. Viper and Pictomancer are fun jobs, as normal for  XIV. However, one should come in with the right expectations. This isn't going to be another Endwalker, or Shadowbringers. In the words of a certain villain turned ally, the Final Curtain Fell on that play. Now the curtain rises on a new one, with new parts for all to play. Yoshi-P when putting this together understood the stakes couldn't keep rising, there needed to be a soft reset. So the new play needs some world and character building. The Warrior of Light/Adventurer is not the singular focus this time, as the WoL transitions to a mentor capacity in teaching others how they can help others, while still getting to do what they do best. Solve problems.\n\nThat said, the expansion does have issues. Many scenes felt like they should've been voice acted, but for some reason weren't (In the English version at least) and I feel like parts of the story could've used a different perspective. The lower stakes story will feel slow to many also, especially after the mile a minute pace that endwalker had. Something I think some more Adventurer focused moments could've helped counterbalance. A lot of the quests see certain NPC's off on their own while we as players are more or less Idle in a cut scene. I think a lot of the side quests carry the load of the adventure aspect. The sheer size of some places leads to optimization issues that caused frame rate lag, even on a higher end system. While this could also be from sheer population, it is likely related to the huge graphical update.\n\nAll in all, fun expansion, if you're coming in with the right expectations. It's okay to dislike this one, and I get why many do. But at the end of the day, it's enjoyable even with the issues. I'd give it a solid 7/10.

Of course not, we wrapped all that shit up with a tidy bow back in EW. Just like ARR, this is a serviceable groundwork to lay some new rules and establish a new status quo. Moreover, the actual themes in this expansion resonated with me, much like the ones in EW did - themes of 'family' are always going to be pretty rocky, especially since no two families are alike. For me, though? It hit close. Expectations, both meeting them and casting them aside, sibling love and sibling rivalry, parental love and negligence, and all the different forms those can take: I think DT handled it pretty well. Mind you, I'm a sappy sod, so anything with even a hint of genuine emotion and heart behind it can probably get me emotionally invested.\n\nAbove all, though, I went into this expecting a summer vacation arc with little-to-no stakes, and came out pleasantly surprised that it was both that *and* an engaging appetizer for what we had to expect going forward in a post-EW FFXIV where our old plotlines were wrapped up and new ones have begun to dangle.

Personally, I enjoyed her character arc, and I liked her Japanese VA, so it was a good experience for me overall; however, if the main character of the expansion doesn't land for you, then you will have a bad time. \nPros: \n- Dungeons and trials are some of the best the game has ever had. They are very varied in mechanics, themes, style, and the difficulty also feels nice. Here's to hoping they don't nerf them. \n- The graphics update is amazing. Almost everything looks way better now, I've been revisiting older content just to see the improvements. \n- Most of the new zones are beautiful, the last one most notably. \n- I've liked the additions to the classes I play. This is subjective, of course, but I've had fun with my preferred jobs and roles. \n- The last zone of the base DLC is seriously some of my favorite content in the whole game, up there with the best from ShB and EW, not only aesthetically, but they made some really bold gameplay choices that make your character's decisions feel impactful. Really improved my opinion of the expansion. \n\nI think the decision fo making the WoL a mentor for this expansion was going to be a divisive one no matter what, but it was handled well for the most part IMO, so I'll give them kudos for that. I never thought that my character was deprived of agency for what it's worth.\nFor me, Dawntrail is tied with Stormblood as the \"worst\" FFXIV expansion as they both have similar defects and qualities, but I don't think that makes it a bad DLC. I recommend it overall. \nThe FFXIV community seriously needs to understand that something can be good without being the absolute best, and that something can be flawed without being dogwater.", "timestamp_created": 1719904162, "timestamp_updated": 1719904162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168756053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104673470", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10.

Id like to double down on most of my previous review. I did not hate wuk and honestly like her more than I care for either of the twins. The trials and dungeons in this expansion have been some of my favorites ever. The graphical update did wonders for my immersion and the extra dye slot is phenomenal. \n\n My only real complaints are \n1. Not enough y'shtola or estinien. Need more of them, best characters out of the scions by far.\n2. So many of the long boring fetch quests could have just been extended cut scenes. Ive saved multiple planets at this point, why am I delivering Ice cream as a quest and not a cut scene?\n\nBonus:\n3. this isnt really a complaint of dawntrail but ff14 as a whole. these cutscene animations for player characters gotta start catching up with the times. Theyre so stiff, like I get they cant do too much because of size differences but dang dude, some of these animations have been used on repeat since ARR.

I see a lot of people don't like that we aren't really the main character, but tbh I like the change of pace. Though speaking of pace, the pacing of the expansion up until the end of the first major plot point is abysmal. The pacing holds the expansion back from being great, it is definitely the weakest expansion. The first two zones were literally putting me to sleep. Anyway, onto the good in the expansion. The story being told is again one of the weakest, it's good, but it is also building up for the next saga, so of course it has to mainly be build up in similar respects to ARR. The story being the weakest doesn't mean its bad by any means, I really enjoyed the story being told, following Wuk Lamat on her journey to become dawnservant. Wuk Lamat is definitely the highlight of the expansion, she is Lyse but actually good. I find myself actually watching cutscenes with her in them as opposed to skipping a cutscene everytime Lyse appeared during Stormblood.

WoL taking a backseat\nWelcome to the vacation arc folks, we're back to normal adventurer stuff. We're along for the ride again, and that's ok. It's gotta be a huge weight off of the WoL's shoulders not to be the tip of the sword for once. I feel like, in a narrative sense, I can actually take the time to work on side content. Yeah, in Endwalker I knew that the story would be waiting for me if I took a break, but the lack of a sense of urgency is lovely.\n\n2. Wuk Lamat\nIf your main problem is that the person who literally hired you to help her out is taking up a lot of screen time, that's kind of on you for not tempering your expectations accordingly. We've never been to this continent before, she's a native with a lot of investment in what we're doing. Of course she's gonna be front and center. Showing us around, taking charge of quests, and talking a lot. Do y'all remember ARR Cid? Round 2. Regarding her characteristics, think of her position and how she was raised. It's only logical that she is how she is. Having finished the expansion, she's honestly become an excellent character, one who I can't wait to work alongside in future expansions(crossing my fingers). \n\n3. The story itself\nI've already covered the WoL's position in the story, so I'll now tackle the story itself. To sum up: Ishikawa and Oda are gone. This is a brand new team, writing a brand new story. Yeah it's not with a new cast of characters, but comics have been doing this for decades. If you don't like their writing, I'm sorry that their writing style isn't as palatable to you. \n\nLastly, to those of you who are seeing \"Mixed\" [as of 1 AM on 7/2] and are worried, or being convinced not to play it.

I think the twist in bakool ja ja's storyline is really when the expansion became more interesting. it's just a shame it took so long to get there. as for sphene, her motivations were also clear from the beginning, she cares most about her subjects, and the way their culture evolved turned sinister, the only way to sustain their current lifestyles was to kill others.

It's also been complained about the pacing, which, again, is fine.\n \nWuk Lamat is constantly referred to as annoying, but I don't see an issue with her. You see her learn and develop over the course of the xpac, which is the point of her character. She also rambles on a LOT about \"loving her people\" because she stands in such stark contrast to the characters she's having to fight against. The story isn't meant to be about US, unlike previous expansions. The story is about helping a character who isn't used to these kinds of things to grow into their own, which is why, so far, every character has been great (mostly). I get Wuk saying \"FOR MY PEOPLE!\" annoys some, but it's there for a reason, and it shows she's sticking to her Resolve, no matter how bad things get. She's not giving up who she is as a person. \n\nAs for pacing, I think people were putting way too high of expectations on this expansion after a wrap-up of a TEN YEAR OLD STORY. This is the new ARR starting point for future stories. It's going to be different and a bit rough around the edges as the writing team now have to come up with new ways to pivot and expand on what we know. No more Ascians. No more Hydalin or Zodiark. This is new ground we are treading, and I think the team is doing a great job.\n\nExpansion is great so far.

But I'd rather see an insecure person not realizing her strong suits grow than Lyse's seemingly endless trip of self pity. I could have done with some less repetition in dialogue, too. \n\nI'm totally fine however with the story. It was supposed to be light-hearted compared to Endwalker. I never expected it to be as complex as it's predecessor. How could it be? It's just ONE expansion, the foundation of a new story and boy, was the story of the base game boring compared to Dawntrail! I just enjoyed to have flashbacks to all that memories and be right with my theories all the time. Summer vacation. I honestly was surprised that this DLC's story had some pretty dark tones at all.\n\nAlso, many don't like how jobs and roles are handled. As someone who came to hate WoW because they tried hard for betterment and changed everything until barely recognizable I really appreciate the stability of the FF14 core system. There might be some code history issues beneath that. Since you can play every job with the same character in FF14 I totally agree that the differences between jobs should have been kept in place. In other games where you only can play one class per character I always hated these restrictions because they lock you out from aspects of the game and force you to play alts if you want to see them.\n\nWell, with expectations that high after Endwalker I'm not suprised about a mixed rating.

I played all of the MSQ again to get ready for Dawntrail. It's always been this slow. Take your time with it. The job changes are all really solid. There hasn't been a change where I've questioned what they were thinking. (I do miss Spineshatter Dive though 3:) If you're unaware of the Black Mages, there were individuals relying on plugins (which are against TOS anyway) to make an alternative playstyle. No one should be surprised this was changed.\n\nThe new areas are gorgeous, and the side-content as usual is really great.\n\nMy main complaint with the MSQ, especially early on is how it feels the need to re-iterate things that it just showed you. It never overstays its welcome though, it can be grating though. The dungeons are super fun, and Viper and Pictomancer are also super interesting new jobs.\n\nWuk Lamat is also no where near as bad as people are saying. This is a lot more low stakes of a story, and this is less Lyse 2.0, and more, \"Showing a homebody princess that she doesn't know anything about her country.\" It's really interesting when you're looking at it from this angle. We already know Wuk Lamat is gonna win. Peace is her main M.O. This isn't going to change. What is going to change, and does change is why she wants this. It goes from, \"Well, my dad wants peace, so I want peace.\" to \"I love this country, and my people, and I want them to be safe.\"\n\nIt's definitely more simple, and a bit slower than past expansions, but bearing in mind how slow Heavensward and Stormblood were, I don't mind it at all. People are definitely rushing through and not taking time to really engage with it, which I think is super important to do with these games. This isn't a story to rush, much like the rest of FFXIV, it's a game to  take your time with. It's worth it. Not even to mention that it's more FFXIV. I happen to love FFXIV, and I'm pretty happy to have more of it.\n\nPeople got their expectations way too high after Endwalker.

But with this new expansion I feel that I want to share what I felt during it and hope that others who are thinking about getting the expansion will read this as well and understand what I mean. \n\nSo starting off I see a lot of people saying this started really slow now maybe it's because I rushed right in and I was ready and I had everything prepared. But this felt like it was a nice study pace and I think that's what a lot of people are not used to. If we're going to the prior expansion It was very fast-paced It was very much action everywhere and this one did to that eventually but this felt more like a telling of a story rather than an action pack RPG. And I'm okay with that, this was more relaxing and where you start out at it makes sense everything is fairly straightforward. We're going to have a main character who will be helping like in all of the expansions and we will go through a journey of growth with this character as we see in the other expansions. So yes while many people will say this is slow or it's just not the same it's not meant to be the same. So take that with a grain of salt if you are planning on buying this because yes there is a slowness to the storyline but in reality it's just a simplicity and a overall relaxing vibe to it during the first half of this expansion. We are literally doing something for our player to enjoy You know we are working with someone else This is more for our benefit without the whole the world is ending type of situation. And that's all I will say on that to not give too many spoilers. \n\nSecond is the new dungeons and raids and I have to say they have really outdone theirselves I totally play with NPCs the first time around when doing a dungeon or a raid if possible. And I do that for mainly two reasons. One you learn all the mechanics anyone who really has a hard time with that remember if you play with the NPCs you can see where to go and learn the patterns of your enemies far more easier. The second reason is because I want to see what the MP seeds would say in these situations they have unique dialogues for each dungeon or boss they are fighting so it's very cool to see that if you want to get more background on the characters. And this did not disappoint with this expansion, while the new main character that we will be playing with can be highly annoying with their gullible behavior it's because we are meant to see a big change as we progress the story and we do see that to the point that you feel oddly proud of the character if you will as you progress. But to hear the dialogue and to see how they interacted and I'm talking about every month you you will go into these dungeons with if you choose to play with the NPCs does add a bit more touch to it. So the new dungeons mechanics are way harder and honestly I think you will be able to do extreme to afterwards because you have to be fast paced they ramped it up like they wanted to and you can tell. A lot of people commented on that and I believe they are right It feels much more punishing when you mess up in the reaction time has to be fast on your end if you're going to keep up. \n\nSo ask for the story and the gameplay I'm honestly giving it a 9 out of 10. I have my own gripes with the company and the way they do certain aspects of this game so I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a fanboy because honestly they can improve on a lot of different names when it comes to how they present stuff. But as far as the expansion itself goes I would say give it a try maybe not buy the collector if you're really trying to give it a try remember you can get refunds if you buy through here I believe. But I would definitely tell you to try the new areas there's a whole bunch of stuff to do The new weapons are nice, and if anything even if you feel a certain way about the story then new content that was added is pretty fun. You'll have to try it for yourself maybe go watch some YouTube videos if you don't mind spoilers to see this is something you really want to do but for me it was worth the money.

This was a problem in 6.x patches too, and compared to previous expansions, character development is a bit off.\n\nThe story itself without all the fuss was actually good and I enjoyed it. The villain(s) were nothing special, and even though they fall flat compared to ShB/EW, they had their moments. There are also a few interesting side characters which I hope we see more of in the future.\n\nWhat this expansion really excels at is environment and encounter design.

We've spent the past ten years in Eorzea, and now we're in Tural. \n\nOur journey accompanying young Wuk Lamat is one where roles have been reversed, and I say in a masterful way. Where in ARR we were surrounded by mentor figures trying to bring out the best of us, we have become the mentor figure trying to bring out the best in another. This is Wuk Lamat's story, and the foundation block on which so much more may ultimately be built.

It had a completely different pace compared to the expansions following it.\nThat's what you'll get with Dawntrail. It's a bit of a shocking reset in pacing, which is what has led almost entirely to negative reviews for the expansion so far. To be honest, it is slow. Quite slow. It attaches you to completely new characters that you had otherwise not known, especially the main character. There is a substantial amount of buildup action taking place. Square wants you to like the main character and become attached to them, as well as find interest in the new continent, the people and the supporting characters. \n\nBut let's be honest - this is the trampoline for another massive story arc. When I first started playing FFXIV, it was in the middle of Shadowbringers. The ARR story was soooo slow and I decided to buy a story skip. I regret doing that so much! I ended up watching summaries on YouTube about what happened in the story, but of course there are still things I missed. If I could, I would go back and get through the ARR story, despite it being slow at times. At first I was bored of the primary characters - and yet, years later, I love these characters. I came to understand the depth to them that exists and which can only be explored over a much longer period of time.\n\nDawntrail is a reset to FFXIV in much the same way that ARR was a reset. It's a big shift. It's asking for your investment and patience with the story as it tries to start fresh.\n\nExcellent development of characters takes time. Go into the expansion with the mindset of this being a brand new game with a new story and characters you don't yet know well enough to know if you like them. If you adopt this mindset and believe that the end of this story's line will be anything close to the end of the last one, you'll enjoy Dawntrail.\n\nSquare pulled off a redefinition of what an MMO story can be, culminating in one of the greatest endings to any story I've personally ever read or watched.

But I think what determines if you enjoy it is the kinda gamer you are.\n\n90% of the complaints are that the expansion is slow or it takes too long to unlock a dungeon or its people who just started the early access, unlocked the first dungeon or two and think its not challenging enough.\n\nIf you're on this page, I'm going to assume you've played the previous expansions, and we all know that EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. spends the time to layup the story and starts 'slow'. I put that in quotes because frankly I don't think that's a fair criticism. To whine that it takes you too long to get to a dungeon is frankly, ridiculous. The expansion isn't here just to give you handful more fights to do, else they would have just added that on anyway like they always do. The expansion is to *expand* the game universe and give you a story and a *reason* to do the fights.\n\nYes, the cutscense feel quite movie-like but I'd rather that than some rushed, half-thought-out, sloppy mess of a story that's barreled through and has no real purpose. So many games have made the mistake of not letting you see enough background or get to know the characters and then expecting you to suddenly care about them and battle alongside them - so why do we suddenly complain when a game does let you get invested? \n\n'I didn't buy this just to skip through the dialogue' - then why are you here? I, for one, enjoy that I am getting my moneys-worth out of the expansion. I get a rich experience that builds on something existing that I am passionate about yay! If you have a tik tok short ahh attention span, I can't help you. You're probably the type to watch anime dubbed anyway.\n\nThe first two dungeons aren't super challenging, but I still had MULTIPLE randos dying to the mechanics, so evidently its challenging enough for the casual players and frankly, to make super hard content at the beginning of an expansion will alienate a large number of players anyway. Once you get past the first two, the first trial and 3rd dungeon ramp up a bit and it keeps you on your toes and that's what I enjoy. Not everyone wants perma difficult gameplay, there are still semi-casual players about and I don't think they should be excluded. We always get harder content in the end anyway so everyone is happy.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed the expansion - as always there's the running here and there on errands which can be a bit zzzz but the story is rich and the character exploration is great - with each new character having their own issues and resolutions etc - and so far the content is hitting. \n\nIf you're here for the story - get the expansion.

I love the game, but it has serious flaws, particularly in the pacing and design of the MSQ. Regardless of your thoughts on the story itself, the [i]execution[/i] of the story is often very weak, with an absurd amount of time spent walking back and forth to talk to NPCs, complete fetch quests, etc. To be clear, this isn't a problem specific to dawntrail, it's present in the entire game.\n\nWith that said, I think a lot of the complaints about dawntrail are overblown. The story has shifted to a much smaller scale, and I think that's jarring for players who were expecting endwalker 2.0. But I personally think it's a nice change of pace, calling back to the \"adventurer\" days of A Realm Reborn. Unfortunately, that comparison highlights many of the expansions flaws. A lot of what you're doing is done for the sake of world building and tone setting, but could also be described as chores... It really just depends on how much you enjoy a more slow, lore-focused story. I really enjoy it - The light hearted and episodic stories remind me of a Dragon Quest game to an extent. But it's really not for everyone.\n\nGameplay-wise, I'm... mixed. I think the encounter designs thus far have been great, and I love the designs of the two new jobs. But every other job in the game is boring, a problem which was present in Endwalker too. But rather than fix the oversimplification of jobs, they doubled down on it, outright gutting some jobs. Others are largely untouched, but went into the expansion heavily flawed to begin with. \n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the expansion, but it's not for everyone. If you like slower paced, light hearted stories with cozy vibes and simple gameplay, you'll probably have a good time.

How will they react. \n\nI legitimately had to mark myself with a Doritos marker and place down guiding markers for the players that joined me in the final dungeons. And this is honestly no hate towards them, I've been impressed with how many of the players I've paired up with in the dungeon finder thus far have stuck with fight no matter how many attempts it may take. But how will the selfsame healers who were up arms merely a week ago now react to content that requires them to actually know how to play classes as complex as SCH and AST.\n\nAs of writing this I haven't had the opportunity to finish both EX trials yet, and while I may have concerns with EX 2 after experiencing the normal mode, EX 1 has truly dissuaded many of those fears. Mechanics are fast and varied. There are innovative ideas abound, I can't wait to see what sort of Ultimate, Savage and Alliance raids we receive this patch cycle as the very well could be the greatest we ever receive. The short glimpse we have already received of the Arcadion Savage series the aesthetic of an almost Cyberpunk mixed with Dragon Ball-esque tournament set up seems to be nothing short of incredible. \n\nAs a wrap up here I'ma throw some numbers out here to help you make up your mind, if you really want to play what could be the greatest expansion to ever come to FFXIV: \n\nStory: 7/10\nClasses: 7/10\nDungeons: 10/10\nTrials: 9/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nI don't normally review games, but somehow a lot of folks felt it write to leave a review on an MMO's story after playing the introduction day 1. Y'all probably need to address the fact that the two expansions you've claimed to have poor writing are the two where we primarily travel with a female lead.

Why are we here, merely chatting, and why are we spending the first ten hours doing fetch quests? I didn't like the expansion at first, but after giving it some thought... It makes sense in some way... let me explain: [/h1]\n\nThe beginning of a fresh expansion... There are queue times, a new continent, and new trials and dungeons to explore. Aside from the post-game activities and vicious raids, this is what appeals to me about the new expansion. I adore world-building, lore, and character development, but let's be honest:\n\nWe have previously saved the world of Eorzea and the Thirteenth about a dozen times by fighting actual gods, and after Hermes, Meteion, and Hydaelyn engaged in combat with actual gods to preserve the world. After a valiant battle, the Warrior of Light and his allies deserve to relax. The primary purpose of this expansion is to provide precisely that\u2014a break and a holiday. Is it a slow start? Indeed. Will you chat a lot, complete tasks, and act as an errand boy? Yes, and even if the story's pacing could have been improved in practically every way, I don't mind.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3278715289\n\nDawntrail's primary objective is to set the stage for you to discover a whole new continent and globe, delve deeply into historical and cultural events, and aid others. While Wuk Lamat aspires to become the next Dawn Servant, Krile is searching for her grandfather and more info on her earring. You are no longer the focus of this expansion; instead, everything else is. establishing the foundation for future post-game Main Story Quests and gradually preparing us for the impending arrival of another disaster. \n\nPositive experiences will eventually become second nature to you. The expansions Shadowbringer and Endwalker were amazing and featured many highlights, particularly the battle between Meteion and Hermes at the finale of Endwalker\u2014a real-life gods-versus-gods battle.\nThis is more slower, giving you more opportunities to delve deeply into the cultural distinctions between different countries, their populations, and their rulers. If Pizza is your favorite food in real life and you eat it every single day, it would eventually grow boring and uninteresting, even though Pizza is the best right? The FFXIV expansions aim to address this by slowing down and offering you new foods to eat in order to rekindle your excitement for pizza, so please take a break.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3279508604\n\nThe next catastrophe is already at the door, so the Warrior of Light needs some rest. I'm interested to see how the story develops after Dawntrail, how it will grow, and what lies ahead for us in the years to come. This is Dawntrail, a freshly constructed continent that advances slowly yet steadily for your enjoyment. It clearly lacks the grandeur of Endwalker or Shadowbringer, yet it is vitally necessary to provide the groundwork for what is coming in the upcoming years.\n\n[h1] Take a step back, enjoy your vacation and the historical culture of your beloved friends and comrades because sooner or later you won't have the time for it [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1719834517, "timestamp_updated": 1719861497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 154, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668822944164276123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168683165", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983126881", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 544936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1296, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "there was a lot of world building which i expect when we enter a new continent. so it's a little slow at the start, considering all the time-traveling and space fairing we did, they had to dial it back. there are some filler moments, but it's certainly not a deal breaker, i think it's a solid start of a saga", "timestamp_created": 1719832237, "timestamp_updated": 1719832237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168682948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176661614", "num_games_owned": 1064, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 299577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "i love my fellow girlfailure wuk lamat", "timestamp_created": 1719832025, "timestamp_updated": 1719832025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4741097092628479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168682909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121025278", "num_games_owned": 3069, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The updated graphics have made a huge improvement to the scenery.

Main Theme von Dawntrail (Smile) derweil ist auch recht faul, im gegensatz zum Endwalker 2nd theme (Flow) wird hier einfach das Dawntrail Theme etwas umgeschrieben und dann aber mit mehreren S\u00e4ngern, was wiederum ganz nett und mal was neues ist, w\u00e4re aber passender einsetzbar gewesen in der Story.\n\nAnsonsten war die Erfahrung im Spiel, insbesondere zum Ende richtig gut, wenn die Story anzieht, mehr Inhalte kommen, das \u00fcbliche eben, aber Creative Studio 3 l\u00e4uft wirklich Gefahr eine \"Ubisoft Formel\" abzulaufen, wenn sie mit dem n\u00e4chsten Add-On so weiter machen, sie sollten wirklich dar\u00fcber nachdenken der Story mehr Inhalte zu spendieren!!!\n\nF\u00fcr alle die es noch nicht gespielt haben ein hei\u00dfer Tipp um die lange Story mehr zu genie\u00dfen:\nVergleicht die Story auf keinen Fall mit Endwalker, sondern mit A realm reborn, denn Dawntrail ist am Ende des Tages nichts anderes als ein A realm reborn 2, anfang einer neuen Saga innerhalb von FFXIV und auch wenn das die Schw\u00e4chen des Add-Ons bei weitem nicht rechtfertigt, macht es das ganze zumindest deutlich ertr\u00e4glicher, denn besser als ARR ist Dawntrail allemal.", "timestamp_created": 1719825419, "timestamp_updated": 1719825419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492341339588165283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168676582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298530681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "To get it out of the way, if you're primarily a MSQ player your opinion likely will be very different from mine. I'm good friends with my esc key and use it liberally when the story drags, mainly tuning in for the more exciting parts. Truthfully there weren't many and whilst I found the first half of the story the a little slow but otherwise fine I absolutely hated the latter half. When the world is being threatened on a calamitous scale and you're touring farms and sampling local food it just feels like bad writing by someone who has no idea of pacing. Wuk Lamat really didn't need to be in the latter part of the story because it felt like her arc had somewhat concluded by the end of the MSQ and we were being beaten over the head with the same things she learned it the first zone. \n\nIn the end I gave up and sped through to the real reason I love this game: battle content. It's been incredibly refreshing to see the team break free of their shell and try to make fights exciting again. They've made the trial areas more interactive, the new expert dungeons actually have bosses doing more than dynamite and chariot and even the levelling dungeons have pretty much all been bangers. Whilst I haven't done the EX trials yet I'm really looking forward to them as I enojoyed their normal counter parts so much.\n\nI've also really been enjoying pictomancer and whilst melee isn't my thing a lot of my friends are having a great time with it. The visuals are gorgeous and much needed in the 2024 gaming environment, and Soken has hit it out of the park with the music yet again.\n\nI do feel bad for people who love the story but for me it's always been something I'm happy to take or leave.

Yes.\nDo I expect SE to do it in one expansion? No.\nThe nuance is that they have shown mechanical integration in their story more engaging than Fetch Quest 101 but the feedback for those wasn't exactly stellar (looking at you Stalking mechanic).\n\nI somewhat agree with the sentiment of Wuk Lamat being... meh.

As the beginning of a new narrative set in an unexplored world, Dawntrail doesn't quite reach the same peaks as its predecessor, and the stakes feel comparatively lower. However, it's still a commendable effort with lots of twists and turns to keep your attention should you take the time to allow the story to pick up pace. \n\nThe new zones are breathtakingly beautiful, offering a visually stunning experience that enhances the overall immersion. The music is nothing short of spectacular, perfectly complementing the expansions atmosphere. The introduction of new jobs adds a fresh layer of excitement, making gameplay more engaging. Additionally, the new abilities and skills are a significant improvement, contributing to a more streamlined and enjoyable rotation.\n\nOverall, while the story serves as a solid foundation for a new saga, it doesn't yet achieve greatness. However, where others have highlighted faults, I see immense potential and am eagerly looking forward to how the world and plot will evolve as we delve deeper into the unexplored parts of Etheirys. \n\nI also want to give considerable praise to the developers for their work in ensuring queue times were at a minimum this expansion with their thoughtful changes to the AFK timer and upgrades to their server infrastructure, this is the first expansion since I started playing many years ago where launch day and the weeks that followed weren't so overwhelmed that the log-in and region servers struggled to keep up.

If you fall in love with Wuk Lamat and her journey of growth, you will find it enjoyable. If you find yourself disliking the character, you will struggle until the second half of the expansion. Honestly, it feels like an expansion split into two parts, like Tural itself.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe first half is far lower stakes and much more layed back. Sure there is combat and dungeons (with some actual big threats towards the end of the first half) but overall its focused on the growth of both Wuk Lamat and her brother.\n\nThe second half is where the actual scaled gets pushed and we feel like we are being challenged from a strength perspective. I don't want to get too into it since its a really interesting twist (but one I did see coming)\n\nNow I also do have issues with the first half of the story, the pacing until the first dungeon, but Endwalker almost mirrors this point for point, but it has actual stakes during these branching paths where Dawntrail does not. Wuk's innocences and ignorance also does come off as childlike in a few scenes as well but they are more lighthearted; I can see how some would take issue with them. Lastly, I can see how some people may find one of the twists in the first half a bit forced as did I but I was fine with, but I see some players having issues.\n\n[h1]Dungeons/trials[/h1]\n\nI think the dungeons and trials are wonderfully designed. The new mechanics are rather interesting and its fun seeing some old mechanics I haven't seen in a long while return. While my own personal taste is focusing on the story and crafting, these feel like they are pushing my skill forward and think rather than turn my brain off and let my faerie do the work.\n\nThe set pieces are also fantastic and I am looking forward to others thoughts on the dungeon and trial designs.\n\n[h1] Closing Thoughts / other things I missed[/h1]\n\nI wanted to atleast talk about Viper and Pictomancer a bit though I haven't touched them. Pictomancer looks immensely fun and fairly strong with fluid rotations while Viper itself is far more than \"pirate\" themed as I originally thought. It has more going for it but also seems to be one of the simplest dps classes added. No intense thought about rotations other than swaping swords.\n\nOverall, I do see this being polarizing for the opening but I think as people push through and grow to like Wuk Lamat, the expansion might pull around.

The story is a brand new chapter into a new story arc which takes its time to show the new world, its little intricate stories, breath taking sceneries and quirky new characters!\n\nPersonally, I enjoy the main character taking more of a mentor & support role in this new MSQ. Its honestly a breath of fresh air after all the previous expacs where everything rests upon our shoulders, I find it that Meteor's (WoL) journey as a hero is coming to a close at least on this story arc which is all about Hydaelyn & Zodiark and now is taking steps back to enjoy well earned rest.. and of course assisting Wuk Lamat's own hero's journey.\n\nFor once the story takes its time to unravel, which I can understand is not a cup of tea for other people who'd prefer a simple, clear cut, apocalypse now stories where everything is always constantly on the line.\n\nOf course I must state I absolutely LOVE the graphics update, a much needed face lift to bring out even more stunning details forward to make the world of Final Fantasy 14 even more vibrant and lively to be in. \n\nTwo new classes being, Pictomancer and Viper are wonderful in aesthetics wise, they feel wonderful gameplay wise and fit in quite well with the currently existing roster of classes.\n\nNow I'd like to address the other negatives which I have seen in the reviews, all about Wuk Lamat and how the story is boring and a chore.. all of this is by a design.\n\nLets take a trip through a memory lane shall we? Starting onwards from ARR weren't we all bit of a Wuk Lamat at one point? Thrusted into an adventure with only the equipment what we have, new to the lands and what is expected of us both story wise and as gamers. I admit Wuk Lamat can be bit on the nose some times but I recognize the beginning of a journey in her much like how we all had ours, stumbling through the hoops and learning along the way. I find the commentary on Wuk Lamat being simply bad or annoying rather shallow and lame.\n\nAs for the story, it has been stated many times that the great adventure and chapter of Hydaelyn and Zodiark has come to an end and this is merely a beginning to a new one, a new story if it wishes to be worth of any salt or investment NEEDS time to establish its people, a new world and setting proper.

Viper's ability to disengage from the boss at quite a distance and still maintain a lot of damage output if you've built the resources for it.

Negative reviews are given by impatient people with issues to manage expectations.\nThis isn't like we are playing post ARR, Dawntrail feels more like Heavensward + Stormblood. \n\nIt's interesting how stuff works: back in Endwalker, when we travel using the new Aetheryte technique and everyone feels sick, no one complained about it and the fact that Estinien is bad with coins. WHy? because we know those characters for years and it's funny to see them out of place. Who felt annoyed when Alphinaud jumped into the water in Stormblood?  Wuk Lamat is just following the opposite direction, she is way above Lyse and ARR Alphinaud already. She is not arrogant, just childish. \n\nEvery expansion has up and downs: ARR has post ARR, Heavensward has Alexander and Diadem v1; Stormblood has Lyse, weird pacing and Eureka v1; Shadowbringers has volley; Endwalker has lopporits and later on slower labyrinthos.\n\nDuring Live Letters they focused more in technical aspects (new systems and graphics) than anything else (lore) because  they are working on setting up a decent codebase for more 10 years of development.  \n\nMy bet: During 7.x, Dawntrail won't be big in terms of lore, but great in terms of content. Probably better than any previous expansion. If you are waiting for the same emotional damage (built during 10 years), you may want to leave and come back in a few years.\n\nThe lore behind viper makes clear they are looking for simplification in terms of lore right now. What viper do? vipers act as a snake and they hunt big and dangerous monsters, and they like it. That's all. There is nothing magic behind it, no void, no aether, nothing. Just unga bunga. \n\n\nIn short:\n\n+ Animations\n+ Graphics update with modern technologies (FSR 2.2 via mods tho)\n+ Grass sounds\n+ Natural mounts movements\n+ Hrotgals looks detailed and cutscenes really want to show how nice they look like. \n+ No waiting time to log in (servers upgrade promised years ago finally is working)\n+ Viper is an aggressive beast, a nice mixture between Ninja, Dancer and Reaper.\n+ New filter/blacklist works decently\n+ TRUST system is definitely worth it. You can level up viper/picto in a few hours (3-4h) from 80 to 90. \n\n- Lightning update destroyed some scenes where  darkness/shadows plays a central role to feel immersive. \n- Dual channel dye doens't work as intended for every equipment.

The English voice acting of the lead characters (whom I'll refer to as Cat lady & Bunny Boy) is bad, sometimes even hilariously tone deaf. It had me physically cringe a bunch times when the voice I'm hearing does not sound genuine whatsoever when supposedly portraying X emotion. This change has massively improved my enjoyment, although I miss the English scions. \n\n------- Old impression:\n\nI'm almost a day of playtime into this expansion and it's a very weak start from a story perspective. I knew it was going to be a more calm story and that is fine since I was tired of the continuous high stakes. However, instead of going on silly little adventures with the gang (as I expected from the promotional material), we just end up being sidekicks for some really bland personalities.\n\nThese make the main questline an absolute snooze-fest, even if the overall world setting is decent.

Spoilers obviously ahead. Encounter review past that.\n\nThe first half of the story revolves around the fight for succession, where your role feels more like that of a mentor to Wuk Lamat. That means that from lvl 90-95 basically you will mostly spend your time with her, so if you dislike her after an hour, the only thing that really changes is her resolve, basically she is like Lyse but if she actually grew as a character and wasn't handed everything, however she tends to be on the goofier side. I personally don't mind that, after the past 2 expansions I sort of needed a break from saving the world every other quest (even if we sort of do at the end of this one) and I like Wuk Lamat even if she got a bit annoying at times. I also liked how Urianger and Dadcred assumed the roles of mentors for Konoa, after all of these expansion it sort of felt natural here. However I have to say that certain parts felt a bit rushed, Bakool Jaja being at first a third rate villain just to give us some backstory and switch to being a good guy while better than just killing him is still awkward when done so quickly and this isn't the only example of that. Zareel Ja also feels like a mediocre villain, almost like Zenos but not as crazy (so as if they removed the only fun trait). However. once you get to lvl 96 msq that's when things start to pick up and get really interesting. I liked the culture of Alexandria and the way souls felt more like currency to them. And also Sphene finally felt like a proper villain and also character. Overall the expansion has set up plenty of questions just as they have aimed to do, Overall it feels like a new ARR, though it is a shame however that the first half is so slow, since I doubt a lot of players will have the patience to sit through a couple of hours of \"fetch quests\". \n\n\n\nAs for the encounters, the new dungeons are without a doubt better than what we got in Endwalker, majority of the bosses won't recycle mechanics even half as much as in the previous expansions. The formula is unfortunately still the same but the bosses at least especially in post DT, were very entertaining. The trials were without a doubt better, normal versions were far more interesting than the first 3 HW/SB/EW, especially the last trial trumps over majority of trials in the game period. The 2 currently released extremes are pretty good, better than EW for sure. Makes me excited about the future trials and especially raids/ultimates. \n\n\n\nAs for music...  come on, Final Fantasy XIV might have its issues here and there but music remains as strong as ever (though I hate that disney song we got, too cheesy even for me).\n\n\n\nSo tldr -\n\nIf you are willing to sit through a slow beginning, you might enjoy the story as it goes, especially during the second half of it. If not then you'll probably want to skip. Gameplay wise, it is great so far, hopefully SE will keep it up.", "timestamp_created": 1719766746, "timestamp_updated": 1720274282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52323460578918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168618879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031654787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not finished the expansion at the point of writing this, but I feel the need to get my thoughts out in the sea of negative reviews currently plaguing this expansion launch.\n\nFirst things first: If you are a fan of FFXIV and the way it has told its stories up to this point, Dawntrail does not shake things up too much, other than the severe danger de-scaling compared to Endwalker. If you are NOT a fan of the other stories this game tells. YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS EXPANSION.\n\nNow with that out of the way, this expansion has a very strong start with introducing characters and motives, and growing those characters. The action in this early part, however, is very small scale. If you can't stand character building, you will not like the pacing. But It is NOT paced badly, everything feels like it happens exactly when it needs too. \n\nThe quality improvements, both in the story and game as a whole, really make everything feel much smoother than prior expansion. The graphics update, coupled with the changes to armor and improvements on player customization, have a shockingly strong affect on how the game looks. It can be in stark contrast with the items they have yet to update though, so it can occasionally be a little jarring, but they are working on that.\n\nAnd now, for the actual GAME itself. I have only played the new class Pictomancer so far, but it is fun in a very open way, allowing you to slightly change up which spell you cast next, instead of being a purely rigid rotation. They harder fights so far, have actually been significantly harder than similar fights from past expansions, though story content still won't fill that itch for harder content that extreme/savage/ultimate provide.\n\nAs stated, I still have a ways to go before I can have a comprehensive review, I do plan on leveling Viper to comment on that class as well, and I can't talk about crafting/gathering at all yet, but this expansion is off to a bright start.", "timestamp_created": 1719766517, "timestamp_updated": 1719766517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494965404272079468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168618839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029444447", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "A more chill story with much lower stakes, which I really enjoy after the tension of the last few expansions.

She puts on a face of ridiculously shallow optimism because she is crippled by imposter syndrome. And rightly so; she hasn't done anything other than party and faff around with the happy vibes. She desperately needs to make something of herself for a change and find some purpose in life. And her situation isn't helped by the fact that she has no real vision for what to do with Turral after saving it from her brother either. A brother who in in fairness, is trying to speed run the war cycle so no one else will be deluded with thinking it is worthwhile to do so. His folly is he is so fixated on making war a living part of the Turrali consciousness that he surrounds himself with questionable intentions and visions which threaten to undo everything he is working for.\n\nWhile by no means is this 10/10 writing, that by itself is a stunning improvement over the ARR plot of \"invaders with technology equals bad. Also, invaders are manipulated by an apocalypse cult into trying to destroy the world because bond-villain bad guys.\". If you compare the Ascians in ARR to Endwalker, you can tell there was a shrieking tonal shift as they finally figured out what to do with them as the underlying antagonists. Have you done your daily story roulette? It's a daily reminder in how FFXIV used to handle its exposition, and it subsidizes your suffering for 350 tomestones.\n\nThe writing team is trying to reset the tempo. Part of what made EW work so well was how it deeply contrasted with what preceded it. ARR's stakes felt hollow compared to EW's because it had Stormblood and Shadowbringers to ramp up into it. ARR lacked a compelling villain of any kind, and Nidhogg was a singular dimension of vengeance fueled hatred. Zenos made cruelty and malice something real and tangible. Emet Selch made the Ascians complex and impactful. Meteion, while flat and one dimensional, served as a vehicle to describe how nihilism is its own delusion. And given the scale which the conflict had escalated to, that our enemy was less a complex character and more the sum total of a supposition, this was apt.\n\nSo having done a full Gurren Lagann spiral, the script needs a reset back to dusty tomes, weather worn treasure maps, and dungeon delving.

The only fight in the entire expansion, that i absolutly dont like, is the final one tho. \n\nAs far as the new classes are concerned, while i do like the pictomancer generally, it is very underwhelming in the animation department and redrawing your pictures feels awkward. especially the hammer, as it goes *draw hammer* *click button that activates the ability* *use hammer*   feels very weird.\n\nWith the Viper i don't get warm at all. It has several dozens of abilities that you do not drag onto your action bars, instead \"activate\" them by going through various paths between your primary two abilities.  Your jobgauge is supposed to show you, which route to go... but in reality it doesnt realy show a lot, playstyle is way too fast to look at it in the first place, so you go by the thing that is flashing.\nDon't like it, i am a big fan of having my buttons on my actionbars", "timestamp_created": 1719754322, "timestamp_updated": 1720312837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520803451538085938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168601730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125390692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]My personal commentary and review of Dawntrail thus far![/h1]\n[h2]No major spoilers[/h2]\n\nAmazing Expansion, I'm about 3/4 of the way through it already. As far as new chapters after [spoiler] world ending calamities [/spoiler] go, this is a great starting point. Something lighthearted that explores interpersonal and emotional stories on a ground level with the backdrop of one of the most beautiful locations in gaming.\n\nWuk Lamat is a treasure to spend an adventure with, her willingness to learn about others was a prime motivator, bridging the gap and promoting peace. The characters alongside her developing and learning through the story has also been incredible, and well written. I wont mention much on that front because its a deeply personal story about unity, family, pride, change and forgiveness that needs to be played through.\n\nI see a lot of negative reviews about there being 'poor pacing' and 'filler dialogue' from people who clearly don't care to engage with this new location and its people, or their cultures which are a central part of the story about understanding each other and standing united. It's a joke, and they clearly are tourists and dialogue/cutscene skippers just here to complain. \n\nComplaints about Wuk Lamat being naive, or too lighthearted (calling her \"annoying\" when she's bubbly and cares about other people more than herself is crazy) when the central core of her character is being willing to learn and understand other cultures to bring people together rather than just killing them for disagreeing are absolutely unfounded and silly. We should be welcoming that mindset at this point in the story, its a fresh start, enjoy a little peace and unity.\n\nThe DLC isn't perfect (none of the things wrong with it haven't been in prior expansions, like fetch quests, welcome to MMOs people!), or the greatest of all time, but its lovely. The story thus far has been engaging, personal and emotional, and the design of the fights, dungeons, trials and such have been very fun. Definitely excited for the continuing story of FFXIV in the coming years. I hope these negative review people finish it so they can see how wrong they are, and what the story leads toward.\n\nSolid 8/10, up there with Endwalker and Heavensward for me.", "timestamp_created": 1719754205, "timestamp_updated": 1719754205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498751163482666016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168601230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115492322", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 122599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Once you reach the the first trial, the story quickly begins to become more interesting. By the third dungeon I was really interested in the politics of the new realm we have entered, and Wuk Lamat's accession to the throne. I am not sure what the hate for Wuk Lamat is, because IMO she is reminiscent of what we were in ARR and HW, under the guidance of Papalymo, Yda, Kan-E-Senna, Lyse, etc...\n\nNow, I do want to make my opinion clear for the devs- the first quests before the first trial are absolutely and unnecessarily boring... There was really no reason to drag out the tour guide lore that long... It could have been made interesting with maybe some Monster Hunter-esque style quests as we explore the new lands. But, instead we are bartering with NPCs, and doing one-liner interviews with random locals for almost 6 hours... It was boring and I was questioning the expac's quality that entire time.\n\nBut, after completing the third dungeon I am hoping this game play and pace continues that has been set! We now have reasons to care about these new characters. \n\nPROS: \n* New lighting / graphic update is great! \n* Not just the graphics, but equipment texture's have been revamped! Cloth, silk, metals, wood floors, stone, etc.. Fantastic job from the art team. \n* Viper + Pictomancer!

It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. And from what I read it's all just complaints about the story, not the game proper.\n\nThe story:\nFF14's biggest selling point is arguably the well written story (for the most part). This expansion comes after the drama and high stakes closure of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and tires to present a plotline with a lot less stakes, to have us a break from al lthe world shaking threats. It focuses a lot more on worldbuilding, and honestly feels like a coming-of-age story for Wuk Lamat. On a personal opinion, I find this a good choice, as just adding more and more drama is bound to make any story feel pointless and tiring in the long run. We've seen enough of those in other games.\n\nThe graphical upgrades:\nThis is a high point of the expansion. Texture, shadows, materials, hell even the ground got a lot better. You really have to see how the gold glitters, compared to the old game.\n\nThe gameplay:\nMore of the same, though some classes got reworked, so muscle memory can and will trip you up. Healers still don't get any damage rotation. The combat still holds the same pacing, and bosses are constantly trying to get you to pay attention to the animations instead of just the orange markers on the grounds, something that has already been a trend for years now.\n\nIn short:\nA worthy expansion to FF14. After the universe saving of Endwalker we were solely in need of downtime. The new world gives the writing team a much needed blank canvas for worldbuilding instead of having to wrangle 10 years' worth of loose ends. The graphics upgrades are phenomenal, while the gameplay is just what you always expected.\n\nYeah 100% recommended if you have the game itself.

It allows the exploration of themes that weren't possible within the Hydaelaen saga framework and the rigid restraints of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn's mandate.\n\nI have enjoyed watching how initial impressions and the frame of marketing has given away to the truth of matters, and look forward to completing MSQ, whose thematic exploration appears to be in the realm of political philosophy. There is more sophistication and creativity in in-game cutscenes and action segments.\n\nStill, there is a sense that the Scions are present because of their toolset to help resolve events with their specialties and providing a connection to the past with their observations of the New World. It begs the question how they will be involved in future expansions.\n\nSide content and other world-building is still best-in-industry and engaging, with much thought and care put into how the world is what it is and the way characters behave. The new cultures & characters are well-implemented. You come to experience the New World and its people in a way that's authentic to the human experience, with obstacles & conflicts rooted in reasonable disagreements and concerns and solutions in line with the characters and their approaches.\n\nDawntrail upgrades the graphics of Final Fantasy XIV, and it shows. The game is gorgeous and vibrant if you have a system to take advantage of it. Material texture and reflection is the best I have seen outside a trailer for Call of Duty. The new zones are huge in breadth and verticality; they do not disappoint in their design and layout. Legacy areas have changed their look and feel as a result of these upgrades. This new coat of paint refreshes existing content, but some work needs to be done yet as older areas were not designed with this lightning in mind. The new continent has no such issues.\n\nThe two new jobs are interesting. Viper plays fast and hard with more emphasis and attention to positionals. Pictomancer looks intriguing but I haven't put any serious time into it or got a sense of optimal play, but it appears to fit well with all the other jobs. One downside is that the Pictomancer's abilities tend to obscure elements of the battlefield, which is a bit of a theme with this graphics update: the game is prettier to look at but harder to follow. There are configuration options to help manage this issue.\n\nOverall gameplay appears to be entering a new phase; combat is faster, more complicated, and doesn't have quite the same feel as before; different, not worse. The first dungeon I encountered is one of the best in the series and fitting for what is assumed to be an experienced player at this point. Changes to the FATE system adjust incentives and increase rewards sensibly while emphasizing more AOE play with higher NPC counts.\n\nOne sharp criticism I would have is that something concerning has happened with the quality of the US voiceover work. The Scions are all still there along with a cast of new characters, but something seems off in the delivery and sound mixing. I don't have enough knowledge of audio to know what it is. The issue is most prevalent in Krile & Thancred's delivery, it is gut-wrenching to hear given the high bar set by previous entries and makes me think that it might time to discuss passing the torch with some characters if the cast's heart isn't into it anymore. \n\nThe music, on the other hand, is what you would expect from Soken & Co: Excellent. There was constant praise in the new home city due to the jazzy nature of the tunes, it felt pleasant and uplifting to listen to.\n\nI am biased for this game, as my play count will attest. It represents an inhuman amount of effort that has delivered a quality product supported by past investments to insure the integrity of the game both in a technical and creative sense. While reading some of the negative reviews and understanding some of the criticisms, there is so, so much value on offer here for long-time players. You can tell the developers care about this game and want to deliver the best player experience possible. This title delivers on its marketing promise.

Ill be honest, im really not even a beach or tropical area person but this is stunning. Especially the looks of the city is so Aztec-y and ancient. I love it!!\n\nI love that the focus of the story so far seems to be keeping a diverse country stay together and strong and that Wok Lamat is one of the main people that actually want that and would be able to do that if she were to succeed. I'm excited to play through the rest of the story. So far Im seeing a lot of potential and I think the message so far is good. Wok Lamat is a very good character. I didnt think i would like her at first, but she feels very realistic as a person with her flaws and hardened exterior and has such a kind heart.\n\nI love that the vibe of the story is more chill in this expansion since we've already saved the world and are just continuing our lives as adventurers. It reminds me of Frieren a little bit, where the story starts after they've already defeated the Demon King.\nI'm sure something bigger will happen. I can already tell something is brewing.\n\nIf they go in the direction of not going \"bigger and bigger and bigger\", Ill be happy, cos I find that games that do this tend to be stupidly ridiculous.\n\nBuut anyway, Ill update this as I go through the story. Just feel it's necessary to add some positivity to offset the clear foolishness being posted by people who just are reviewing to either post first or just review blindly cos they had thickened expectations and didnt enter with an open mind and just didnt even watch any cutsccenes or read story.

Yes, but I can tell that the developers are setting up a story to be told now that the previous story was wrapped up in Endwalker. Is the story perfect? No, but I still immensely enjoyed it. Wuk Lamat is an absolute treasure and her VA did such a good job with the character. I was super happy having Erenville join our adventures too. Always nice too see some fresh faces joining our little adventuring crew. What I will say is that the dungeons, trials and just overall the music is some of the best I've seen and heard. A lot of work went into them and you can easily notice that. There was not a single dungeon I didn't like and that's coming from someone who has always had some issue or dislike with an MSQ dungeon previously. I will say that the one thing that is the biggest negative for me though is the amount of fetch quests in the MSQ. I felt there was a few too many of them especially early on and some of the later MSQ quests.

Pretty widespread opinions, easy to find 'em, all that, don't need one more church mouse in the choir. But Dawntrail's getting differing opinions so I figure I'll finally toss my hat into the ring.\n\nI won't pretend Dawntrail has been some grand adventure thus far. It's relatively relaxed, and sure you're trying to stop some shitty candidates from taking over Tural, but honestly it has been pleasantly quiet and low-energy after we near-literally ran all over the world to save it in Endwalker, and saved a whole other world in Shadowbringers. The intrigue is low-stakes ARR-tier in comparison. But it's pleasantly relaxing at the same time.\n\nThe cast is what it needs to be. Wuk Lamat is a very stereotypical anime protag, but considering we haven't really had one of those in XIV I'm willing to let it slide. Plus let's be real, she really is a breath of positive fresh air. Hien but Pollyanna basically. The others have all been rather fun, and it's nice to see the rearrangement of who we know and who we don't.\n\nI'm only around level 93, MSQ-wise, as of writing this, but that's enough to know that Dawntrail managed to rekindle a fairly fading ember of being burned out on XIV. The fact that Pictomancer has rocketed to one of my favorite jobs in the game, and the music being amazing...\n\nWon't say it's a must-buy, especially when your dollar needs to stretch farther nowadays when it comes to game companies arbitrarily ratcheting their prices. But if you want a vacation after Endwalker, you could do far worse than Dawntrail.\n\nUPDATE 7/4/24:\nIf I could hammer the recommend button even harder, I would. The bottom half of Dawntrail is positively insane, and I'd tout it as one of the best shout-outs across all of XIV as a whole. It's no Ultima Thule or Amaurot, but as a longtime fan of the series there is something profoundly incredible about what they decided to do for Dawntrail, at least to me.

"language": "english", "review": "People judging a 30-40+ hour expansion main story by the first few hours are absolutely forgetting the classic saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" as they're missing how well SE cooked this time. Sure, the first couple hours might have some characters that are uninteresting to some, and it may be a little trope-y. That's pretty much all within the first few levels though, and by the halfway point things really start to pick up. Frankly, its enjoyable. It might not be some blockbuster finale of a story straight on the heels of a climax many consider the team's best work, and it was never meant to be nor advertised as such, yet it still is a great start to a new chapter in FFXIV. I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far, playing just about every waking moment from the time servers launched, and there is still a bombastic back half of the story that keeps getting better that I have barely scratched the surface of at the time of writing.\n\nWith that out of the way. Graphics update is incredible, with seemingly little impact to performance at least anecdotally. Dual dye channels on gear is a nice long-awaited feature that in some cases looks great, though in others it might leave room for improvement, particularly when the second channel is a barely noticeable button or strap. New classes look and feel great, and most changes to old classes are solid as well, with a few objective exceptions and a few more subjective. Other minor changes like mounts leaning into a turn and certain actions having hotbar replacement options have been good quality of life improvements as well, however the former has admittedly caused some motion sickness in some others, and not having an option to disable it isn't the best design, though I would imagine it might come at a later date with feedback.\n\nOverall, solid 8/10 expansion. Might not replace any favorites, at least not yet, but its better than people give it credit for.\n\nTL;DR: Most people complaining about quality of story have gotten through the equivalent of half a paragraph of the prologue, and don't know the banger they're missing out on.", "timestamp_created": 1719695243, "timestamp_updated": 1719695243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506371617317199707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168530047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180909603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Alpacas", "timestamp_created": 1719693638, "timestamp_updated": 1719693638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168529550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069722212", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 134561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1489, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "As a brazillian", "timestamp_created": 1719693231, "timestamp_updated": 1719693231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168529548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155931712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Praise Yoshi-P for the beautiful Hrothgirls we recieved!\n\nIf you hate Wuk Lamat you're actually cringe try again :3", "timestamp_created": 1719693228, "timestamp_updated": 1719951076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168529082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082816831", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Cannot give the cat scritches 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1719692844, "timestamp_updated": 1719692844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168528728", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969388941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.

Story has the naivete and unsophistication of a Disney movie at times, and is unsubtle and preachy with its themes. I was skipping through cutscenes for the first time in a long time, because I simply did not care about any of the characters, and the story gave me no reason to get invested in anything. Story does get substantially better at the end, however. \n\nI think overall the story is quite cliche, and the execution is very inconsistent. Overall, there is too much telling and not enough showing, and the game feels like a kinetic novel where the player has zero agency. \n\nBut, it does have its own poignant moments that had some real emotional weight behind it. The music and the graphics definitely play a part.\n\nGraphics:\n\nGraphic update is quite pretty, and some of the new zones look quite magnificent. Nothing much to complain here.\n\nGameplay:\n\nProbably the expansion with the worst update to jobs; most jobs get uninspired busywork changes like an extra click of a skill or an increase in buff duration that is basically unnoticeable. Jobs are still incredibly homogenized with no real reason to play multiple jobs; job skill ceiling continues to be reduced with decreased potential for skill expression.\n\nBattle content is noticeably better, though, and it feels like they've stayed true to not making everything too comfy for the player.\n\nMusic:\nLots of cool new-sounding tracks; Soken definitely hit it out of the park with this one. While some tracks feel overused or don't fit the scenario, I appreciate the effort of experimenting with all kinds of new genres. The music in the last zone is especially pretty. \n\nOverall:\n\nFeel like Dawntrail continues to play it too safe, and the game is much more mediocre than it could be. However, the game does have something to offer gameplay/story wise, even if it's wildly consistent. I feel like the expansion is worth playing, and most FFXIV players will enjoy at least some of it, so I'll change to a Recommend (but the Mixed rating is still fairly accurate, IMO, because the game could be so much better)", "timestamp_created": 1719682155, "timestamp_updated": 1720289495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496116429567337036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168514529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128475909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "My catgirl got a graphical update", "timestamp_created": 1719681609, "timestamp_updated": 1719681609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53745192289352417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168513273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007102607", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 810127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 879, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Greet expac.

Too slow, if you ask me, but I've grown used to it. This one in particular, however, feels \"extra\". It takes SO long for anything to actually happen. More fetch quests than ever before, and more backtracking. It's really not the best pacing, although I suppose I can somehow forgive them for that because it's basically the start of a new story and we cannot really build upon past drama and antagonists.\n\nMany people seem to dislike Wuk Lamat, and while I am certainly no big supporter of hers, I really don't mind her all that much. Her personality is funny and her complexes are, to some extent, relatable. I just feel like they don't take enough time to let them truly fester before resolving them, but then again, I am still early in the story, so I cannot really say how it will play out. There are some DT characters I like better than her (her father, for example, fills the Zenos-shaped hole in my heart in his own unique way), but there are also some I like even less. I can deal with it.\n\nThe first dungeons were decently fun to play, but... it's also just dungeons. Gotta wait for raids to truly see what's up. \n\nAs for the new zones, they're beautiful to look at and to traverse. I like the new hub better than Old Sharlayan, which disappointed me in many a way. The new peoples are... basic? At least they (for the most part) made an effort to make individual characters behave differently from one another despite their same-y design and the fact that they are defined by their respective cultures. I am pretty neutral on that one. Could've used more new races, however.\n\nAll in all, a somewhat unremarkable expansion so far. Nothing about it makes me regret spending money, but it also fails at making me as hyped as the ShB or EW opening quests did. Which, to reiterate, might be related to the fact that they have to establish a completely new premise first, thus earning them my benefit of the doubt.\n\nI will give it a thumbs up for now, but I might change that depending on future developments and my continued progress.", "timestamp_created": 1719655923, "timestamp_updated": 1719655923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168480122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176228589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Whoever decided wuk lamats character and voice direction needs to have their job position reconsidered...

After having saved the world several times over and barely living to celebrate their victory, The Warrior of Light goes on what is essentially a Tropical Vacation adventure while honoring a foe-turned-friend's request that they see all the world has to offer so they can truly appreciate the mantle they have inherited. Our Character takes a back-seat for a while in the story, functioning as the mysterious and powerful Mentor character to the next generation of heroes, literally Those Who Walk Before teaching Those Who Walk After as has been sung in Answers for over a decade now. As the story progresses the Warrior of Light takes a more active role as a new threat is uncovered and they once again fight to defend the world they have been charged with protecting. \n    As we progress through this story, Dawntrail offers incredible music, some of the most beautiful scenery the game has to offer, two new incredible jobs, one of which quickly became my new favorite, dungeons and trials that are some of the most fun the game has had in years, sets the stage for a bunch of fantastic new content coming up next, a ton of QoL and visual improvements to the entire game that makes older content look and feel even more amazing than before, and I've never been more excited for the future of this game. I was worried that after Endwalker, the story and content team would run out of steam since the stakes literally can't get higher than that, but they immediately put those worries to rest. Dawntrail is, as I said, the perfect follow-up. The Warrior of Light saves the world and gets to go back to just being an Adventurer experiencing new places, learning about new cultures and people, facing new foes, and continuing to appreciate the world they saved.\n\nThe Mixed reviews at the time of posting this review are already climbing back up as people who actually play the game finish up with the story and come to leave their own review, and in the meantime people like a certain grifters on Twitter will continue to cry about how this game is \"woke\" without realizing FF14 has been \"woke\" since the very beginning. This has always been a game about friendship, co-operation between people and cultures, fighting back against oppression and cyclical violence, and having empathy and compassion for the struggles of others, as Final Fantasy as a franchise has for decades.\n\nDawntrail is an incredible expansion, it surpassed all my expectations, put all my worries to rest, and I can't wait to see what comes next.", "timestamp_created": 1719622696, "timestamp_updated": 1720326877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168448049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026491227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, just re-reviewing to bump the score up a bit.

J\u00e1 a segunda metade da hist\u00f3ria foi o que me deixou realmente feliz e salvou a expans\u00e3o pra mim, a pequena viagem com Erenville e confus\u00f5es no \"velho oeste\" foram os momentos que me remeteram ao in\u00edcio da jornada como aventureiro ,dias mais simples, gostaria que essa parte da aventura tivesse tido mais \u00eanfase tamb\u00e9m.\nSolution 9 e Alexandria foram uma grata surpresa, a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o com modo de vida completamente diferente mostraram que FFXIV ainda pode surpreender mesmo depois de tudo o que j\u00e1 foi visto em expans\u00f5es anteriores e as quest\u00f5es exist\u00eancias e filos\u00f3ficas presentes a partir de Shadowbringers, continuam fortes aqui, tanto \u00e9 que gostaria de ter tido mais chances de interagir, conversar e questionar mais a personagem Sphene que apesar de ter motiva\u00e7\u00f5es e objetivos claros, parecia ser uma personagem muito profunda;\n.

The story in the first half plays out like an adventure anime following a race to the throne with a couple neat twists in there that keep it interesting throughout, whilst I do agree there has been some pretty mediocre quests throughout and some down right filler quests so they could hit that sweet 100 MSQ per expansion mark, for the most part I would say a good 80-90 of the 100 quests are good and keep up with an engaging story.

Engaging story and the new graphics update is a welcome addition. Queue times are being handled pretty well as compared to Endwalker's launch. \n\nRegarding the vocally loud small group of complainers. The expansions story is meant to be less \"high stakes.\" This has been deliberately mentioned every live letter because this is starting a new ark for the storyline. \n\nSome of the writing isn't nearly as good as it should be imo, so I can agree on that, but part of this is purposeful to explain why the center characters are flawed in the story. I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people speedrunning the MSQ and not taking the time to enjoy it. It's only been out in early access for not even three days, this is not enough to full embrace and understand a massive expansion yet.\n\nWhile I agree the story is not at its high point; it is not meant to be. This expansion was even advertised as being an adventure that wasn't out-of-this-world. I also understand the disdain for Wuk Lamut - though take into consideration this character is designed to start out as blissfully ignorant. She was raised as royalty and doesn't understand the world yet. The point of her being a fool is so that she develops, and to further display how royalty isn't always fit to rule. \n\nThe way I see it, this is practically Stormblood 2.0, and is similar to ARR to put down lore foundations, and I'm fine with that.\n\nThe small amount of vocally angry reception is honestly a reflection of gaming culture itself. We should be enjoying media, while critically analyzing it, but not trashing and thrashing about like children.\n\nJust enjoy the video game. It's not like this is Ubisoft releasing trash for $70.

In this expansion, they introduce a new race, two new DPS classes and the content you would expect from any FFXIV expansion: new dungeons, trials, zones, hunts, etc. If you are curious about the content in more detail you can check the 7.0 patch notes from the Lodestone.\n\n\nIf you can't access the new expansion after buying it, go to your Steam library and copy the expansion key.

This shift was much needed for the storyline, and it required a change in my own approach: I took my time completing the main quests, engaging in FATEs and side quests along the way, which allowed me to finish the main story with two jobs at level 100.\n\nCultural Representation and Zones\nThe new zones introduced in the \"Dawntrail\" expansion are a testament to the developers' dedication to cultural representation, particularly of South and Central America. These areas are diverse, depicting various regions such as:\n\nThe Andes, inspired by Argentina, Colombia, and Peru\nIguaz\u00fa, influenced by Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina\nAmazonia\nThe Caribbean and Mexico/Texas Far West\nAs an Argentinian, I could identify numerous cultural, political, and habitual references that made these zones feel authentic. The graphical updates, enhancing shadows, lighting, texture materials, and character models, further enrich the experience.\n\nCharacter Development\nThe expansion wisely gives characters like G'raha Tia and Y'shtola a break, preventing overuse as plot devices. Instead, we are introduced to new characters like Wuk Lamat, whose naive charm is reminiscent of Sora or Tidus.\n\nNarrative and Gameplay Issues\nHowever, \"Dawntrail\" inherits a persistent issue from both Final Fantasy XIV and notably seen in FFXVI: an overreliance on filler cutscenes and missions that simply move the player from point A to B after epic moments. This old model of storytelling can be tiresome. Other RPGs, such as FF7 Rebirth, NieR Automata, and FFXV, integrate lore and world-building more seamlessly through in-game dialogue and dynamic interactions.\n\n\"Dawntrail\" lacks engaging gameplay outside of dungeons and trials. It would benefit from utilizing the instance duty system more effectively, incorporating lore-building dialogues during combat or exploration. Additionally, improving exploration speed is essential; while the zones are vast and beautiful, both players and their mounts feel sluggish.\n\nTechnical Enhancements and Drawbacks\nOn the technical front, the graphical updates include improved animations and lip-sync during cutscenes, significantly enhancing the game's visual appeal. However, the DLSS implementation is subpar, lacking preset choices, a dynamic DLSS option, DLAA, and causing issues during cutscenes such as blurry backgrounds and texture artifacts. An option to increase internal resolution would also be beneficial, as the current method forces changes to the HUD.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, \"Dawntrail\" is a strong expansion that introduces significant cultural representation and technical improvements. However, it could benefit from addressing narrative pacing issues and enhancing gameplay and technical features for a more immersive experience.", "timestamp_created": 1719571138, "timestamp_updated": 1720282475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168392693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000269400", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Make sure you enter the keys for your pre-purchase bonus content/Early Access (same code) in Mog Station.
