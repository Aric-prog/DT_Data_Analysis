But Endwalker disappointed me to no end and was a dull slog to get through. So I gave Dawntrail the \"ultimatum play\". Is this where I cut ties with the game? Or is this where I find my excitement again?\n\nMy excitement lasted all of about 5 hours. Hub city, general introduction out of the way, and into the first zone, and the theme was set for the expansion. Boring chores while relegated to sidekick for a somewhat monotone protagonist of the story. Villains literally boiled down to trash \"I was sad once, I just wanted to play on the playground\" motives. I could deal with that, not the instant \"But I forgive you for all your sins :DDD\" attitude after. Wuk Lamat isn't a strong enough character to carry the plot. The performance is also a bit flat and monotone. (No childish crap hate over the actress being trans. Trans rights are human rights. She's just a rookie VO receiving meh directing)\n\nDawntrail was a slog to get through. Attempts at cultural showcase felt more like bad tourism after a brief wikipedia skim. Class design that overthrows previous classes because they're new and flashy while complexity isn't rewarded. Soken's weakest performance yet on OST (it's still a solid 7/10 OST though.) and an overstated, overshowcased graphic overall that you ultimately only really feel if you're a gpose addict, and they're modding over all your improved textures anyway.\n\nThe only part I enjoyed was the lil corn dude looking to help the hungry in each area.\n\nIt was bound to be meh because it suffers from \"new arc expansion\" issues, but I didn't think it was this bad. \nNot that you, reader, might care about this part, but I think that's it for me, XIV.

Moments that are supposed to be extremely sad just feel like she is not in a good mood, and happy moments feel like she\u2019s exchanging pleasantries.

But when you have to go through this garbage MSQ, it just becomes not worth it. It\u2019s a shame considering the MSQ has always been an enjoyable part of the game.

It became interesting only within the last few levels and around the last zone for me.\n- The voice acting is very weird in this expansion for some reason? Especially the Wuk Lamat art direction. I don't have anything against her VA, she's just doing her job, but clearly the directions she's been given by the higherups were terrible. She's become a meme in the community because of how emotionless she sounds most of the time. Sfeeeeen lissen to mi.\nBut it's not just her, other NPCs we know and love have some problems too (from the top of my head Y'shtola having poor quality mic, Thancred speaking in weird hushed voice most of the time he shows up).\n\nNot everything is absolutely terrible about it of course. But sadly the only good thing I can think of so far is:\n+ The quality of the first raid tier (so far) is great.

They hover on the periphery, all surface and nostalgia, like cameos designed to remind us that we once cared.\n\nIn this parade of tropes, the world begins to feel strangely small, its ambitions stifled. The gesture toward Latin American culture, while vibrant in palette, feels about as grounded as a travel ad. It\u2019s there for the eyes, not the heart, offered up in a way that evokes the sheen of familiarity without delivering the pulse and intricacy that could have truly made it part of Eorzea\u2019s world. It\u2019s as if the worldbuilding, once grand and unified, is now assembled from the patchwork of focus groups and market-tested designs.\n\nWhat remains is the persistent sensation that something vital has been lost, that Dawntrail is a dream of a story only half-remembered, an impression more than an immersion. The story unfolds like a modern series pitched to entertain briefly and then pass away without much trace, a glimpse of something that was once more than the sum of its parts. It is a long way from the epic tapestries that made Final Fantasy XIV what it was, and, if anything, it is a reminder that the soul of a story lies in what it risks, not in what it repeats.", "timestamp_created": 1728537969, "timestamp_updated": 1728537969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600957095623016357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176704895", "author": {"steamid": "76561199530250350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "ARR if ARR got worse, had terrible story, and made no impact or gave us any kinda setup for a long lasting story.\nI don't know what new era this is meant to start when there's nothing left for the future expansions stories to connect DT to any new stories arcs like ARR did leading to Endwalker.

I probably subbed 9-11 months of the year after that, with my longest break being in Endwalker.\n\nDawntrail is what killed FFXIV for me.  Unlike what a lot of reviews will say, I didn't particularly dislike Dawntrail's story.  It's basically a shonen anime story mixed with some common Final Fantasy themes.  I don't think it's a *good* shonen anime story, but it functions.  I skipped most of the non-major cutscenes (and went back and watched the ones that I later learned were major cutscenes), but I began doing that late in Endwalker, too.  That kind of arrives to my major problem with DT and why, after thousands of hours, I'm done with FFXIV for the foreseeable future:\n\nSquare-Enix does not put enough effort into innovating and improving their game.  After ShB, EW, and now DT I can say I am quite frankly sick of the \"really bad visual novel\" way the game tells stories and all of the numerous limitations that the MMO engine and design place on what the story can do and where it can go.  I ended up playing WoW Dragonflight during the EW lull just to see what the other half of the coin is doing and while I'm not going to claim WoW is ever going to be a game you play for the story, I think the *way* it tells its stories is just head and shoulders above what XIV is and has been doing.  Because WoW keeps evolving and trying to improve, while XIV hasn't changed at all since ARR/2.0 except for gradual improvements to smoothness of animations in cutscenes, better voice acting, and so on.\n\nBut, honestly, I'm more of a gameplay player than a story player.  I enjoy a good story, but I can also slide through a passable story as long as the gameplay is engaging.  And this is another major flaw in XIV, in that the gameplay also hasn't changed.  The gameplay of XIV's main story quest barely qualifies as \"gameplay.\"  Go to this marked location, do a thing (usually talking to a marked NPC), repeat.  Sometimes it will spawn a couple of monsters for you to kill, neither of which is remotely threatening and requires no effort to kill.\n\nThe moment to moment gameplay in XIV has always been a sore spot, and I just can't have patience with it anymore.  A low level Warrior in World of Warcraft's Season of Discovery mode has more going on at any given time than a high level Warrior does in FFXIV - how does a game that's fundamentally a month shy of 20 years old at this point somehow have more varied and nuanced gameplay than a game that just released a new expansion?  There's just no reason it needs to be this way, other than (for whatever reasons) Square-Enix simply refuses to even try.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin, for me, was a surprising lack of anything to do after completing the Dawntrail story.  I did the \"expert dungeons\" a few times each, and enjoyed them.  I did the two available \"extreme trials\" several times each on different roles, and had a lot of fun there.  I did the normal raids a couple times each, and had fun.  And I quit literally a day before the savage versions of those raids arrived, because I just... didn't really want to grind gear in party finder, logging in only to reclear savage raids each week and occasionally visit my house to refresh the demolition timer (another black mark against Square-Enix), and otherwise not really playing outside that.  \n\nI didn't care for the mounts I wouldn't use, from the extremes.  I didn't want to grind dungeons for rewards I no longer had any need or interest in, because that quickly devalues whatever fun they might have held.  I'd long since done most of the soloable content from previous expansions during the COVID lull in Shadowbringers and the exceptionally long delay between EW's final patch and DT's launch (and that's even with not having been subscribed for over half that period.)  I might have been able to find some groups for the remaining group content I was interested in finishing, like Bozja or the last few Blue Mage raids I needed for the mount, but with savage days away and with many people not even done with DT's story, pickings were slim at best.\n\nSo I called it.  I want to keep playing XIV.  I enjoyed the setting, I enjoyed the players (something I can't say about WoW), but I just can't justify the subscription fee for a game where the developer just seems too complacent to be willing to put effort into innovating and improving the game.

The new dungeons are really good, but I'll never get them outside of the three I can get in expert roulettes.

We just pray to find new people to play with cause it's something to do. \nDawntrail, unlike Endwalker at least sounds like they are pulling everything out for it. Hopefully the exploratory zone is good because right now it's the only thing in FFXIV's pocket with somewhat enjoyable grind.

Later on they tried to give center stage to Lyse in Stormblood and people didn't like that too much, so I am surprised they doubled down for Dawntrail on that aspect.\n       Wuk Lamat could've been a good \"main character\", however not only is she annoying and poorly constructed but the writing doesn't help either, she has \"secondary comic relief\" energy BUT  we see her almost ALL THE TIME, there is barely any screen time for other characters from our group, and when there is, they rarely add anything of value (More on that later) with the only exception being Erenville who I did like. Basically, my main problem here is Wuk's screentime, it's just too much, it's just so tiresome, gets boring FAST and besides, this is a \"ROLE PLAYING GAME\", are we in the wrong if we expect to also play a pivotal part in the plot rather than sit and watch Wuk Lamat do stuff? If I (The WoL) wanted to take a backseat I'd just play any other videogame, so, what's the point of being a yes man to ONE NPC for 40 to 60 hours?\n\n-\"You wanted less of the Scions? Too bad, they are here! You wanted MORE of the Scions? Too bad, they do nothing!\"\n\nA double-sided problem that has many layers that also intertwines with game-play to a degree. So, here they are, \"some\" of the scions in your group...but they add NOTHING of value, they are non-characters, they might as well not be here AT ALL, even Krile, her arc and some of her story happens off-screen and she gets a  very small focus despite her \"main focus\". They should've gone all the way and have only Krile come with us and make up a new party that consisted of people from Tural...but sadly both gameplay and \"fanservice\" get in the way, we HAVE to have the Scions for the \"TRUST\" mechanic, so good luck having a non-playable race party member in the story, but they are also here because they know people will cry if they are not present, in the end, we end up with the worst of both worlds, the usual characters but they are just cardboard cutouts of what they used to be...and don't get me started on \"how we faced Urianger and Thancred\" in the contest (This never happens, so it ends up being a waste).\n\n-\"You just hate learning about new cultures\"\nCredit where credit is due, I am from LatAm and I really loved seeing aspects from my country and food in there, but sometimes I do think the society ends up being a little too \"idealistic\" and ends up a little uninteresting in the end. I've seen people say \"how boring, we gotta cook some mexican dish in MSQ \", but that's not the issue, the problem is that the story is poorly told, we go around talking to NPCs and learning about it... but they prepare the dish off-screen which was a total bummer, it's supposed to be an audio-visual medium so why not take full advantage of it?. Rinse and repeat for almost every challenge, Wuk Captures her Alpaca off-screen instead of it being a fun minigame or something, it's just uninteresting. I DO want to see more of the cultures... but they mostly only \"tell you about it\" and you don't really get to experience it in any interesting way.\n\n-\"You just hate that the stakes are now low\"\nNot really, no, besides, the stakes end up being HIGHER than every other expansion (Other than Endwalker, maybe) as if we fail it means the eventual erasure of every other shard, that is way worse than the \"rejoining\" if you ask me.\n\n-\"Don't be too hard on it, it's basically ARR again, they are cooking!\"\nFirst of all saying ARR was bad is a bit of revisionism considering it was highly praised on release (Mostly because it was compared to 1.x) and then it slowly took a dip in popularity because... the expansions following it were even better (Which is... a GOOD thing), that doesn't mean ARR is now suddenly bad. It did have actual lower stakes for sure (Personally, I find the post ARR MSQ the ture boring part at least up until you reach \"The Keeper of the Lake\" but it does have a LOOOT of optinal dungeons and content to take a break from the cutscenes). It also offered something other than MSQ, and that was freedom to explore most of the map after the first few hours, getting lost, discovering an optional dungeon, etc..  it ACTUALLY felt like and adventure, not like a guided tour in the Americas. It is not a fair comparison. Also, MSQ should be good on it's own ON RELEASE, not good in retrospect because they will deliver some cool payoff in 10 years.\n\nI could say more, but I wanted to tackle these usual things people in defence of the game bring up. I hope I HOPE they return to their previous quality in MSQ in the next patches at the very least. I DO love the game, story and characters, but they were mishandled this expansion, very sad because I wanted to love this game that finally tackles the culture from my country.\n\nFinal note on game design, I really wanted them to take a risk in terms of how the story goes, like being able to explore at your leisure and discover things on your own, something to shake up the fomula in both gameplay AND story, because having to babysit an NPC is hardly a good \"risk\".", "timestamp_created": 1728356605, "timestamp_updated": 1728623885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489134311676025391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176581857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198949096953", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 80904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6617, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Might fully elaborate in the future.

However, I do really enjoy the dungeons and I've been told by many the endgame is where the fun is at.\n\nWithout spoilers: We assist Wuk Lamat in a contest to be the next king/queen of their nation. We are on Wuk's team against her 2 siblings and 1 other antagonist. ALL 3 of the other are written better than she is. Each character has their own policies for the nation. Wuk's policies are \"peace and happiness.\" Peace and happiness isn't a policy you dumb cat! I would have rather assist one of the siblings instead of Wuk. Her character is just annoying, a try hard, weak, truly has nothing going on in her head, and just wouldn't shut up.... just give me a random Khajiit from TES and that would've been a better character. I lost my freaking mind wasting 45 mins getting a saddle to catch an alpaca for a quest while her brother rolls up already completing the quest with an alpaca... (if you played you know the alpaca!) Toward the end of the contest all the work you did became pointless with how it played out. There is a few good moments where the story would pull me in for 5 mins then I was checked out again for hours until the next big event pulled me back in. When I finally got a break from Wuk, it felt like I was thrown into a horrible filler season of an anime where the anime gets canceled after that arc. When the arc ended I was dealing with Wuk again...\n\nIf I were to rank the expansion it would be Shadowbringers > Endwalker > Heavensward > Stormblood > Dawntrail > ARR.\nThe ONLY reason why Dawntrail is not at the dead bottom is because ARR was so slow setting up characters who have been with you from the beginning and the setting of the world. \n\nI'm still gonna dump my game time into FF14 because I do love my community and have been enjoying the game greatly apart from the Dawntrail MSQ. Square Enix, do better next time. I've seen what y'all can do with maximum effort. This wasn't it.

About 2 years ago this game started inching towards becoming a waiting room for a new good MMO, which is now fully the situation. This game does not let you have any real choices of any kind, or make your character truly individual, and there is nothing in the game that involves or relies on skill. The dungeons have become boring aquariums with glass walls on either side and an obstacle-free path in the middle. 85% of typical random ingame chat has vanished off behind Discord. If you're looking for fun you're going to have a hard time finding it here. Devs have neglected the game for years, or at best had the wrong ideas and priorities, especially PvP, where the devs have allowed a cheat meta to exist for countless months, and also setting up a host of intricate job action macros will give you a decent unfair advantage (but only about 5% of players bother, enough to steal match wins though). The game was going to a good place, but the devs took a few wrong turns, were then informed by the community about the wrong turns, so the devs then took more wrong turns and refused to turn back. Dawntrail's controversial story quality, which can be banged out for an alt character in just 3 afternoons (unlike prior expansions), is the least of their problems. The screenshots shown on the Dawntrail store page look great but are not properly representative of the experience, and the zones you visit have become no-reason-to-go-back questing backdrops more than ever.\n\nI would almost recommend the free trial so you can play A Realm Reborn- but they did nerf  and tamper with the two final main plot dungeons of ARR and made them less impactful, changed/removed scenes and dialogue (some were voiced), and reduced the amount of players you do them with from 8 to 4, making them just the same as any other dungeon.

The pacing was rough and though I'm glad we spent time with great new(ish) characters like Wuk Lamat and Erenville, FFXIV has established a precedent thus far, treating at least one of the twins as deuteragonists all the way from ARR to Endwalker, while allowing new and recurring characters some time to shine. I didn't care about the second half of the story or its stakes whatsoever and found myself missing our typical cast of characters. The post-Endwalker content held strong and excited me for what was to come, but having finished Dawntrail and being forced to sit with the quick epilogue that happened immediately after the final boss, without a chance to resolve anyone else's stories, save for Erenville's and Wuk Lamat's, I'm a bit worried for the future of the game, as it's built a reputation for it's strong and emotional MSQ.

I found myself skipping most of the cut-scenes after about an hour of being over exposed to the expansion's spotlight character. \nBe prepared for some new and well designed zones that evoke a sense of narrative storytelling that would be superb.... if it wasn't completely overshadowed and trivialized by the main story. This might be forgivable if the main story was engaging... but instead you're playing chaperone and second fiddle to Wuk Lamat. \n\nWuk Lamat is an incompetent and often times insufferable character who feels like a writer's pet that escaped from the realms of fan fiction. The character in small slices would be just fine, but she fails in depth to provide any means of connection to you as a player which is horrific for a character they have framed as the expansion's main protagonist. She is a self centered, virtue signaling, shallow character who should have been little more than a quest NPC or perhaps a recruit to the long stale Scions at best. None of these facts have anything to do with the character's VA, who has been inserted in the usual drama whenever somebody from a particular community receives any measure of criticism whatsoever. \n\nContent wise, the game is in many ways at its peak. But lets be real; that is not a very high bar and its gated behind the most banal story campaign they have written as of yet. We enjoy ff14 for the stories it shares and allows us to experience with our friends. When you fail to deliver engaging narrative in ff14, you essentially fall flat.  14 has had its moments where it was weak (ARR and stormblood) in the past, and recovered with some of the best (imo) MMO storylines I have ever played (Heavensward, Shadowbringers). \n\nHopefully they listen to the feedback and don't hand-wave all their dissenting criticism as toxicity, however that seems to be the industry trend. I will ultimately NOT recommend the game during Dawntrail, however if you're considering this game as a new player there is a feast of content leading into danwtrail that will keep you engaged for months.

bring was perfect, but until Endwalker, This game Got one thing other games and MMOs don't have, EPIC STORY.\n\nFor some reason, The dev team decided to go full retardation mode and give us the worst story in the entire MMO & RPG history, They advertised this expansion as a Vacation for the players, while the PLAYERS NEVER ASKED FOR A VACATION. \n\nCons: The lazy writing, stupid story, stupid characters, Bad English VA, and no build-up; all indicate that this is a Vacation for the Dev Team and not the Players.\n\nHow to solve it: Bring back Koji Fox and Natsuko Ishikawa, At least they never fumbled like the current writers and localization lead.\n\nAll I ever wanted was to pick up from the end of the Hydaelyn and Zodiark story arc into a new one without cutting ties with the previous one and have more solo duties like end-walker and shadow-bringers, which give deeper meaning to the story.\n\nBut for some unknown reason, the story had to be a fully infested DEI expansion, writers Gave the focus to Woke Lamat and made the MC (warrior of light) sit in the back seat, this is an intention move since the partnership with SBI is still going, and yes I will not believe that Square Enix cut ties with SBI just because SBI removed SE's name from the website. (I am not stupid like your DT lead writers)\n\nGreat dungeons and Trials do not mean Good Expansion / DLC, This game lost its core which is the story, and Yoshi-p to come out after months of the release and say he anticipated the mixed review is a terrible sign that things will go even worse, if you know your product does not meet the quality criteria of the previous, why release it? Why give the reigns of the story to first-timers without you supervising every point and step? You admit that you allowed this to happen despite seeing the Bad writing, and you dare to still call yourself a producer & Director?

I loved Stormblood, I have a lot of history with Latin America and loved seeing how the zones incorporated different regions (even if it wasn't exactly perfect). I love side characters, cultures, and zones (which is why the Ruby Sea and Azim Steppe were able to carry Stormblood for me), but the characters and story just ended up being ankle deep. Plenty of cool concepts, but the only characters I really liked were [spoiler]Gulool Ja Ja, Koana, and Sphene, altho Sphene really is just on the list because I do like her concept[/spoiler].\n\nI feel like I was pretty much the ideal audience for a lot of this, but like, let me spend time with the people of the separate cultures (as with Kurenai, Sadu, Magnai, Hien, Gosetsu, etc), I don't need Wuk Lamat editorializing everything and forcing me to experience everything through her [i]interpretation[/i] of these other cultures and characters. This is a common pitfall for a lot of writers who focus on empathy: substituting someone else's experience with their empathetic [i]perception[/i] of that experience. Empathy is important, but it's often inaccurate and generally doesn't capture human complexity. A related pitfall is reducing all conflict to misunderstandings--empathy does not cure all evils. A good deal of conflict arises because people are (appropriately) passionate about conflicting values or because victimization is complex and restitution to one victim damages another victim's chances for restitution.

All that said, Dawntrail is one of the worst story experiences I've ever played, and I don't understand how they could get it so wrong. Going into the expansion I already had my expectations set so low, and somehow they managed to under-perform even those. EVERY moment I felt like I was going to find something enjoyable in the plot it was undercut moments later. Your characters duty as \"mentor\" to the new main protagonist is relegated to standing to the side and clapping as she overcomes all obstacles through the power of love and delivers one horrendous speech after another. When the stakes rose to their highest I still couldn't find relief from the inane \"walk around town and ask people about their feelings\" drudgery. Even to the very end, when I finally thought I would get some relief from the absence of the walking, talking void of charisma that is Wuk Lamat, she LITERALLY breaks through the walls of reality to remind you how little you are enjoying the game. I have no issue with the idea of relegating the WOL to more of a side character role and focusing the story on another character. I thought they did quite well with that in the Endwalker post MSQ.

Endwalker was okay too. I warmed on it gradually I think, I felt lukewarm about it initially but I grew to be reasonably satisfied with how it ended - especially after the Endwalker alliance raid series, and ESPECIALLY after THIS nonsense.\n\nDawntrail is the worst expansion I have played so far, by a lot, purely speaking of the story. I am not referring to gameplay here, which has been good. I think it's great to play at least, like the other expansions are as well. No complaints there.\n\nBut this is just going to be a review entirely of the Dawntrail MSQ because, I haven't played Dawntrail since I cleared the story and I don't know if I'll even continue to play for the rest of this expansion, I am kind of just disgusted by the game right now. I intend to avoid spoilers in this 'review' if at all possible, I'll be vague about the twists and turns it takes.\n\nIf you are reading these recommendations, or played it yourself, you probably know Wuk Lamat is something of a divisive issue. For my part I don't think I so much detested her because of the characterization of her, which is fine really, but because I think that as a character, she isn't that interesting to have to tolerate for the 70 or 80 hours or whatever this expansion was. She's just not that interesting and I didn't really like her vulnerabilities, quirks, or... and this is a bit in the weeds, but, I think that the way she gets the WoL into the story is kind of outrageous?\n\nThis is technically from Endwalker, the setup, so I don't mind talking about it here. Politically speaking, it seems pretty ridiculous to me that you, comparable to a divine entity in POWER LEVEL alone at this point (who is still just a humble adventurer), is being asked by Wuk Lamat, to win... a power struggle. In her home town. Halfway across the world. And the stakes are fairly minimal. I don't want to get into all the hypothetical 'what ifs' there but it bothered me, and it's covered up by one line \"it's okay I was told I can bring whoever I want\".\n\nOne of your friends in the game asks you in Endwalker, \"did Wuk Lamats offer sound interesting\" and that was the wrong time to ask me because I instantly said no, no it does not, and he's like well that's okay, WoL, maybe you'll change your mind after you go there.\n\nI was strongly bored for most of the story and was not engaged by just about anything that happened. There were VERY rare moments where I felt like I liked a character here or there, such as Koana or Gulool Ja Ja, but for the most part I was... simply BORED. And that's impressive, I think. I ended up being so bored that eventually I could not take it anymore, and I grew horribly frustrated with the story, which has never happened with this video game before. \n\nI have sat through a LOT in Final Fantasy XIV, but this is the expansion - and in the MSQ no less, not even optional stuff like the entire Hildibrand questline which is also apparently divisive - this is the MSQ series where about 60% of the way through I completely lost my temper with the game and just was shouting at the game OKAY, I GET IT. MOVE ON PLEASE.\n\nThis may sound extreme but I'm serious, I was just so done with it. \n\nHalf of Dawntrail is green jungle and the other half is a purple nightmare, and I couldn't stand either half. I ended up hating the second half more because it was so different that it didn't even feel like I was playing the same game anymore. I think they took it way, way, WAY too far. Certain other parts of FFXIV's optional content have also... basically pushed the envelope a bit, with the setting and the look of the world and such, but THIS expansion, went WAY too far.\n\nOh, and the writers once again showcase plainly that they really have no idea what they are doing with Krile. So why's she here? Same with the rest of the Scions - their character arcs are over, right. Why not make way for new characters...? We had a perfect jump-off point for them somewhere after Endwalker, but instead, in this expansion it's \"Avengers Assemble!\" again, basically. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I LIKE all the Scions. But they have nothing to do in this expansion's story! They are just kind of there.\n\nI had a ton of random little niggling problems with this expansion that annoyed me throughout and I could not stop thinking about them for the entire duration and many of them weren't fully answered and there were a lot of things that I saw coming for instance calling exactly who the 'real' bad guy was and so on and so forth. It was just so rote and uninteresting, and most of the locations... I mean, yeah I know Central America, it exists. \n\nI know about Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas. I am familiar with these things. I know Machu Picchu. I know em. The game sort of just presents these and expects you to be amazed without hardly dressing them up at all. Dawntrail says 'these are tacos mezcal and mate tea' and I go, yes. I know those. Am I meant to be effing impressed??? It felt for things like this, on the level of a tiny child that just learned of them on Wikipedia and is just showing .jpegs of them to adults at a get-together. Very good, tiny child? I'm not sure what you want from me.\n\nThere's alpacas in this game too, and while I have never really been a big fan of them, they're okay I guess, in this game they felt especially like, they kinda were just there as a clumsy appeal to people, it didn't feel like... they belonged. Like what happened to chocobos? I thought this was Final Fantasy.\n\nIn this fashion and in others, Tural seems to often forget that it is still taking place literally as an island in the world of FFXIV. Most stuff should be pretty much the same, right? Especially since they do a pretty poor job of explaining sheepishly that, oh yes Tural has always existed 'over there' and has definitely had some trade sort of kinda with Limsa, or something, it's vague about it because they don't want to address the fact an entire continent just materialalized out of nowhere basically. I can look past that somewhat, but like I said it's real strange that Tural basically comes off like an alien world for no good reason at times.\n\nAll the races, that we know as Miqo'te etc. also have weird names here. It made sense for Shadowbringers. It does not make sense here to my mind and it doesn't seem to have been necessary. I never understood why they did that. There are 'small differences' between some of the beast races (who are 'allied societies' now) in this expansion and those from others, but, I don't know. Was it literally just an excuse to not have to go back and HD-ify those old races...? I don't know? I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt there somewhat, but...\n\nThen there's also some of the other things. Hrothgar females I think don't have many hair options, I don't think they can wear helmets still, same with other races, still. Lots of work yet to be done in 'modernization' of the FFXIV engine and armor assets, textures, and so on. A lot of people are upset about those things. I am too, somewhat, just that it's 2024, a couple expansions on now... there's still stuff needs fixing.\n\nSo yeah, I found Dawntrail an abject disappointment. I was not expecting THAT much.

It's the exact same garbage formula every single expansion, and the massively requested improvements to basic game systems made back in A Realm Reborn are still absent 10 years later.\n\n[h3]List of stuff that absolutely sucks:[/h3]\n\n1. WoW back in 2004 had a massive world with little to no loading screens. FF14 still has instanced zones that are freaking empty. There's nothing to do in them aside from collecting freaking aether currents to unlock flying. The world in this game sucks. You don't explore it, you just teleport around for 100 hours to complete the garbage MSQ and then never go back (unless you waste your life mining nodes).\n\n2. Classes feel like absolute garbage to play. Rotations are needlessly convoluted because the devs can't figure out how to make anything matter. Melee DPS generally have 3 freaking separate abilities that function as an AUTO-ATTACK. It's filler for when you can't do anything else, and it takes THREE WHOLE BUTTONS. Then another 2 buttons for your AoE filler. That's besides all the buttons you use ONCE in a 20 minute boss fight. I have freaking carpal tunnel now; thanks game.\n\n3. The dungeons, although the bosses within are good, suck. It's a straight line through, no exploration or anything interesting. You get a few trash pulls and then a boss, rinse repeat. The big issue is that trash pulls are incredibly monotonous, unfun, and have ridiculous HP. It's just designed to inflate time, just like every other freaking mechanic. In many dungeons, you can't even pull all the trash at once because there are \"gates\" that separate you from the rest of the trash.\n\n4. Trials, although the best part of the game, have insane queue times if you are DPS. We're talking 30 minutes AT LEAST. You only get rewards for doing a random trial once per day, so no one does them. The best part of the game no one wants to play. What the heck. Give repeating rewards for these so people actually queue for them.\n\n\n[h3]List of INEXCUSABLE gameplay issues:[/h3]\n\n1. Glamour is freaking terrible. This is the system that allows you to customize how your clothing/equipment looks. You'd think games like WoW or GW2 have freaking NASA scientists working on them with how good their systems are by comparison. For some reason, FF14 can't figure out how to make this system even somewhat bearable. It shouldn't be difficult, but it is for them. You'll spend 30 minute spans sorting through equipment on a regular basis because of how bad this is.\n\n2. No chat bubbles? HOW IS THIS STILL NOT IN THE GAME?!\n\n3. The MSQ still wastes your time like its life depends on it. Establishing shots for areas you're already in, waiting around for talking animations to finish after you've already skipped the dialogue, waiting for your character to finish their talking animation even though THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LINES OF DIALOGUE. Go here, go there, go back, go back, go there, go fi- no... don't fight just yet... talk for another 40 minutes. Oh, you're close to the next objective? Let me teleport you to the middle of nowhere. IT IS BUILT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.\n\n4. Tanks can solo dungeon bosses. This is just stupid. DPS exists to do damage, healers exist to heal DPS. Tanks exist to be immortal and do damage. Dungeons would go faster with 4 tanks, the balance is atrocious. Watching tanks solo a boss after you die is the worst thing ever. It takes like 20 minutes, but they can do it. This game design and balance is dog tier.\n\n[h3]List of inexcusable non-gameplay issues:[/h3]\n\n1. If you buy the game, you can't download it without first paying for a subscription despite there being an infinite free trial. Depending on your internet speed, the first day of your subscription could be wasted downloading the game.\n\n2. They are freaking greedy. Paid expansions, paid monthly subscription with additional fees for extra in-game retainers, cash shop far worse than its competition (paid character appearance change, exclusive mounts, clothing, emotes, level boost, story skip, etc..). Even freaking WoW, made by the most sunken company in the history of companies has better monetization than FF14. WoW's cash shop is less egregrious, and you can completely change your appearance for free whenever you want. WHY AM I PAYING YOU MONEY, SQUENIX?!\n\n3. Servers ALWAYS have queues. Increase the freaking capacity by a bit. When there's heavy traffic (expansion launch, etc...) the game becomes a freaking nightmare to log in to. And for the love of all that is holy, KICK PEOPLE OUT OF THE GAME IF THEY ARE AFK. It makes no freaking sense that people AFK for hours are taking up server space.\n\n---\n\nThere's loads of other stuff that I'm just forgetting. There is a decent game here buried under mounds of complete and utter garbage. Boss fights are really good, and probably the best in any MMO, but what you have to do to get to them is unacceptable. The new player experience is a 500 hours visual novel FOR A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION.\n\nThis game sucks.\n\nImprove it.", "timestamp_created": 1726506319, "timestamp_updated": 1728065830, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459729850292205811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "175032730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000423644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The \"FF14 formula\" is just not working anymore.

The battle content has improved and it is fun and enjoyable! But the problem with that is that you NEED to slog through the story to get to the fun parts. Yes, you can skip, but it's still very much a chore. There is so many \"speak to 3 npcs in the area\" quests, there's so much filler and time wasters... it was really a slog. It could have been condensed but for some reason, it needed to be the length of Endwalker, which is.. questionable. One is a finale of a 10 year story, and one is a low stakes, new adventure. \n\nAnd another thing that spurred me to write this review is the job design. Job design is so messy and all over the place right now, and it hurts that we have to wait 2 years for them to make changes, which it may not even be good in the end. Every class feels kind of stale right now with just an extra finisher without really changing the way they play. Some jobs had their interesting quirks snipped off because the devs want to make them easier to play. Which, well, yeah it helps newer players but there is nothing for veteran players. The developers are trying to please everyone, without their own set vision, and it's starting to hurt the uniqueness of each class.

I felt that Krille or Erenville had a more compelling story and arc to explore but instead the writing team went with a new character that does not have enough presence to carry an entire expansion. \nGiven the position of the Warrior of LIght, it would be hard to continue the story without escalation sure but to put the player character in the second seat to a very uninspiring character makes the story absolutely drag along. Dawntrail is the first time ever that I felt compelled to skip scenes during the MSQ and realistically I have felt that the scenes I have skipped were largely inconsequential meaning the writing has taken a pretty bad dip. In prior expansions, cutscenes had reason and purpose thus it was important to pay attention. These scenes, I feel add no depth or narrative insight. In addition, from a gameplay perspective, the questing system at the moment is grossly outdated. It could be okay if the story was compelling enough but the actual moment to moment gameplay is quite bad. Most of the time, one does not get to use the new abilities as they level up or even have varied quest experiences. The dungeon and raid fights are well done and some of FF14s best. End game does have some credence there and i applaud the team for their work but to get there is a slog and a real shame to someone that really has enjoyed the story. Lastly, with class balance, the newest class viper became horribly gutted which was quite a shame as well which disappointed me as well. Overall, a pretty poor expansion that is carried by the endgame dungeons and raid fights but the story which is where most enjoy is poorly done.

Ap\u00f3s o sucesso estrondoso de Shadowbringers e Endwalker, a expectativa em torno da narrativa era imensa, mas infelizmente, ela n\u00e3o entrega o mesmo n\u00edvel de qualidade. Embora outros aspectos do jogo, como o combate, a m\u00fasica e as melhorias gr\u00e1ficas, sejam excepcionais, a hist\u00f3ria deixa muito a desejar.\n\nUm dos maiores problemas \u00e9 o excesso de tramas que o jogo tenta desenvolver e resolver dentro da mesma expans\u00e3o.

Essa falta de equil\u00edbrio prejudica a imers\u00e3o e torna a hist\u00f3ria menos envolvente.\n\nAl\u00e9m disso, a centraliza\u00e7\u00e3o excessiva de Wuk Lamat como protagonista da expans\u00e3o acaba relegando outros NPCs importantes a pap\u00e9is secund\u00e1rios.

WoLs robbed of a vacation-themed story with yet another universe-ending threat.  Scions shoved into the story for trust filler and robbed of plot relevance.  WoL robbed of their one singular spotlight in all of the MSQ during the final trial by Wuk smashing her way into the arena and singularly out-dps'ing the entire party to the sound of a disney theme song blaring in your face.  At best, the story is slow, padded out, and meanderingly directionless.  At worst, it's infuriating.\n\nAn idiot-ball plotline where everyone was holding the ball, where major events happen because the Scions act out of character and the fully capable WoL stands still and unmoving as important plot events happen, culminating in Wuk Lamat patting you on the back at the end and calling you a cool dude.  A story where all characters involved with exception of Wuk Lamat had no compelling reason to be there.  I'm not expecting to be the chosen-one loved-by-everybody main character, I hated that about Endwalker; just give me a reason to be there.\n\nThe \"It's a setup for future expansions\" angle is bullshit given what was accomplished narratively by Dawntrail could have been done more adeptly with a different, better executed plotline such as the vacationy Tomb Raider vibe initially advertised.  As someone who didn't even really like Endwalker, finally finishing Dawntrail was both relieving and depressing.  Post Shadowbringers content included, I've had to live through over 4 years of bad story.  How much longer do I need to wait until I can play through another Heavensward or Shadowbringers?\n\nAll that said, if you're a FFXIV player then you're going to buy this expansion and play through it anyway due to the nature of the main story unlocking all future content.  My only advice is, for once, not to be afraid to skip cutscenes that seem uninteresting.  There's not much you're missing out on this time around.  Forget the vacation-vibes and themes of exploration, \"El Dorado\" was discovered before you even arrived.

But soon I realized that was just a boring build up leading to a boring ending, and the whole story line started to feel like a replicate to previous expansions, while I promised something completely different.

(tl;dr at the bottom!)\n\n...Which is a baffling and horrendously boring experience. I don't want to cherry pick particular moments in the MSQ for critique because honestly this wasn't a death by 1000 cuts scenario, but instead it's a big, bland, block of stale bread that you need to slowly chew your way through to experience any of the gameplay content. And that's even if you're skipping cutscenes.  \n\nFinal Fantasy XIV's MSQ has always been a major event and something to really look forward to, and conceptually this expansion had a ton of potential coupled with a cool premise for a fun, breezy, action filled adventure to kick start a new saga and introduce us to a brand new cast of characters. Instead the campaign is told in the most aggravatingly slow and meandering way possible, and seems to buckle down on FFXIV's worst trend of never actually committing to anything happening to it's main cast in a meaningful way, including the player character. The consequence of the poor MSQ is how it exposes just how terrible and tired FFXIV's actual questing and progression experience has become, the crutches in it's writing and over reliance on familiar tropes and established characters.\n\nOften RPG stories are full with short scenarios and side stories that all build up and lead into the overarching plot, for all the shots taken at Stormblood it was full of character moments for the player and main cast, fairly exciting action set-pieces, and had... new characters, things happening to them, hooks, even! Dawntrail instead chooses to focus it's attention largely on it's new main character Wuk Lamat, who rather unfortunately is a victim of some of the weakest of Final Fantasy's trope heavy writing and who has about 2 character bits that get repeated, and repeated... and repeated. This is conflated further by what I think is probably the largest problem: The Scions are here! Again! Despite having their character arcs neatly wrapped up at the end of the last saga and finished... they're back! For some reason! They've got nothing to do, nowhere to go, and basically stand around to remind you of things they've learned from your previous adventures and hold the narrative hostage. \n\nI understand the writer's desire to spread a positive message, but that alone does not make for a compelling story with morals and ideas that stick the landing. I hope the development team takes the right criticisms on board and fix the predictable, and boring pacing issues for their future updates and expansions, and are more bold in their storytelling next time.  \n\nThanks for reading! If you're on the fence please read other reviews too, as this expansion has many people who have enjoyed it.

I love this game, as my time played on the main game should be testament to. However, to be frank and blunt, Dawntrail deserves the thumbs down. The expansion isn't Horrible. There were a lot of things that it did okay, or even well. But the number items where the expansion just missed the mark is much higher. \n\n>> The story itself is, as many have said, fairly 'Mid' or 'Meh'. I could have genuinely accepted that and been okay with it as the start of a new arc, but Square Enix went *Hard* on promoting it with the image of a 'Vacation Expansion'. To the degree that they literally had a fake 'travel website' set up. And instead we start off on one path, and then get pulled hard into a wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey storyline that asks you to suspend your disbelief, forget what you know about established timelines and lore (that they Might? explain in future patches. Or just forget about), and face down Tron-esque Super Robot Soldiers and Almost-Literal Star Destroyers that we defeat with the power of friendship and plot armor. \n\n>> They made a big deal about some upgrades graphically, which were nice, but a lot of the game's systems are showing their age and/or outright horrible to deal with at this point. Including but not limited too: Combat / Classes (Especially for Healers), Gearing (Overmelding and it's RNG are cancer & the Tomestone Grind still has no alternative gear acquisition options), Housing (Despite the Island Sanctuary from last expansion using the same resources that generate Housing interiors), and more. There are also a number of systems that, while not inherently problematic, have just been picked up from one expansion and put down in the next with little-to-no love and just a fresh skin, and it's beginning to get tedious in some places.\n\n>> The Servers. This expansion has highlighted the fact that Square Enix, despite running one of the world's largest MMOs, has the absolute WORST servers in the market. To start it's the 'DDoS Attacks'. The thing with what they claim are DDoS attacks is either SE has p*ssed off so many people that the attacks disproportionately affect XIV as opposed to other similar sized live service games (WoW, Destiny, Guild Wars, whatever) or SE is just unwilling to put the protections in place like a Blizzard or a Bungie Or both! Or, as a final alternative, they're lying about the attacks and their servers are just incapable of supporting their player base. I actually doubt it's the later here, but it's worth mentioning as the 'other alternative'. On top of the 'DDoS' issues, the actual servers when functioning are poorly managed at best. The locking / half-unlocking of data centers and worlds has been egregious to the point that most people I know have been unable to play with their friends from different servers for the majority of the expansion so far.  'Just pay for a transfer then!', you might say. Which people would! Except when they lock a realm, it's hard locked. Even from their PAID services. But don't worry, when Papa Squenix finally does let you move to be with your friends, They'll.... still charge you full price for the chance. Until they lock it again.

Watching your friends play outside through your bedroom window is fun, right?\n\nAll-in-all, I do not hate this game. But the anger from a large portion of the player base is too much to ignore. Don't let the Twitterverse and the hardcore fans on copium fool you, the 'Mixed' rating this expansion has at the time of this review is not 'Because of Transphobes', it's not 'Because of Hateful People', it's not even 'Because Reddit Mad'. It's the culmination of a lot of frustration from the player base that's been mounting for some time. Square Enix can do better, and has in the past. \n\nWe don't need every expansion to be 'Amazing'. We don't need the wheel re-invented every time content changes. We don't need every new zone and character to blow us out of the water and make us fall in love.\n\nBut we do need better than this.", "timestamp_created": 1725640273, "timestamp_updated": 1725645549, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641541659832000732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "174370252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198960884937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the story and characters of this expansion are the most uninteresting they have ever been in this game. The base game all the way up to Dawntrail is enjoyable. For the most part, it appeared as if each expansion wanted to outdo itself, and as you progressed with the story and over the years there were updates to previous areas or systems. Ishgardian restoration, more 'deep dungeon' content, things like that really added to the overall enjoyment I recieved from this game.\n\n  This story , as all over the place as it was, was just not enjoyable. The situations the characters find themselves presented with are all 1 to 2 \"quest\" affairs that are resolved and never spoken of again, until the last 'zone'. That one takes the whole zone to deal with, and in my opinion, ridiculously and not in a good way.\n\n I do not see this expansion as some vibrant kick off point for another 10 year saga either. It seems more like the season people point at as the downfall of a show. They employ the same tactics of killing off a character to try and tug at your heart strings, but the character 'killed' off in this way has none of the appropriate build up a certain elezen or pink garbed woman did. There is little attachment to these characters. What appears to happen here is they show they are capable of presenting a somewhat enjoyable or likeable person for all of 2 cutscenes, and commence killing them, for you to feel some kind of high stakes thing happened.. and it just comes off as incredibly campy B or C movie sci-fi action flick, made by dumb asses. And I feel like that gives incredibly campy B or C sci-fi action movies a bad name.\n\n What are described in basic terms as long standing feuds and disputes are solved by walking through a zone and clicking on sparkly nodes. I found myself struggling on a first playthrough of the MSQ to maintain a veiled hint of interest. Think of centuries long disputes in regions like the Middle East for example. Throw in some modern politician, wearing Native American battle armor and a giant axe that is as loud and obtuse as the main character of this expansion, make them meet with the head of one tribe or another, make them eat gyros from some other tribe and well, hundreds of years of fighting and territorial disputes all fixed. That is the feeling this entire expansion, from the last mission of Endwalker to the last Mission of Base Dawntrail gave me.\n\n I have had personal experience dealing with longstanding disputes myself, and feel like the people trying to write this kind of story either don't care or are not aware of the minor details or feel like the people they want to see this 'story' happen are too stupid or ignorant to understand that resolution is not a happy party festival with tacos and jazz music. Almost like a form of brain damage watching it play it like that.\n\n I don't want to spoil the game or story. i have no gripe with a specific character or cast member, I just feel like whole experience is sour and thoroughly un-enjoyable. There are 'grim dark' moments toward the end of expansion, that have all the emotional gripping power of watching Bozo the Clown read off lottery ticket numbers between Saturday morning cartoons. \n\n Here is bozo himself for reference : https://youtu.be/C3WxRzH7sCg?si=DlzfYOZH9bgZfb51\n\n This in comparison to something like this.. :  https://youtu.be/K1PL9vKum5k?si=F1cZiX8tXlRNElSR\n\n I have had serious detachment from the story of this game for a while, but this expansion kind of seared my ability to take any of it seriously, even in a suspension of disbelief kind of way.

If you suffer through the main story quest line (MSQ) Dawntrail does offer new mechanics in fights, but this early into the expansion these interesting figths are few and far between.\n\nDawntrail is a story about everyone else but the warrior of light: side character more or less replace the player character. This might be interesting if side characters would be well rounded personalities with meaningful story progression... this is unfortunately not the case. Ultimately player spends about 80% of the expansion just wandering around without proper reason to do anything. The beginning part of the expansion is largely pointless and horribly dragged out. \n\nQuality control also failed with English translation. Characters periodically misspell names and places. Also the voice acting causes secondhand embarrassment at times. Japanese voice acting is better but still not great. When poor story design is combined with poor voice acting the result is not what I have learnt to expect from Final Fantasy. In the future when Scenario Skipping Items become available Dawntrail is good place to use them. I'd say that the somewhat negative reception Dawntrail has gotten is well justified and hope this is not the new normal.\n\nWhile Dawnrail trials and raids do offer new mechanics to challenge the player, this early into the expansion there simply isn't much to do.

Easily the worst DLC for storytelling. Everyone already knows how bad Wuk Lamutt's voice is and how her character is even worse. Literally a white person putting on a fake accent. Square must have known what they were doing making the facial animations for Wuk Lamat so boring because it perfectly matches the delivery of her lines. Having the most monotone boring voice you could imagine during important cutscenes of your fanfiction isn't helping your review numbers go back in the positive side. If you still want to sit through the story for the sake of what came before, do yourself a favor and switch to japanese. Easier on the ears that way.\n\nThe story is also worth being called false advertising, as I was told Dawntrail would be a summer adventure with my closest companions and instead got a babysitting session I didn't even get paid for. Half of my friends didn't even show up. Getting sidelined for the writers' OC is not how you sell your playerbase on a narrative. The entire story could have happened the same way with or without the WoL or scions ever showing up because its obvious how much they want you to love Wuk Lamat. She interjects herself into every single conversation and suffers from an incurable naivete. It makes you try and recall if the world that we just saved had any real people or problems that couldn't be solved with a simple pat on the back or a reassuring smile. I would love to see Wuk Lamat try and fail to talk to someone who lost their entire family to Garlemald siege about how they should just shake hands and let bygones be bygones. As well as giving her more screen time than almost every other character combined. Oh and I thought Krile would get to maybe possibly do something this expansion but I guess taking off her hood and grabbing a paintbrush is good enough to the writers.\n\nFrom a story standpoint the DLC is a failure, and while some people focus more on glamour or endgame savage content, a vast majority of the playerbase is buying the DLC for the story. To see what comes next and what will follow. The only argument any of the defenders of the main story seem to have is any criticism of the story or the characters is transphobic. as just a cover for their lack of any real points in favor of this trash heap. They tote around Wuk Lamat as a much needed (never wanted) bundle of joy in contrast to the more mature themes of DLCs past, when that just speaks even more to her inherent naive nature.\n\nOther than the story, the vast amount of additional content that came with Dawntrail is really hit or miss depending on the player. Most people like Pictomancer and enjoy it while most of the playerbase, myself included, didn't like or click with how Viper was put together. Enough so that Square Enix had to change the entire class to something too simple for those who were mastering the job before and ended up dropping it all together. People like their 1-2-3's. The job changes as a whole are a mess to deal with as how the changes are received changes depending on the person. Some people like what their job got, some people didn't like what theirs got, some switched and some stuck with their favorites. It only seems like the new features each job got are a bit lacking. The only changes a numerous amount of the jobs got was just adding another big finisher button to the end of their combo along with some QoL updates (looking at you, Red Mage).\n\nAnother thing Square added was multiple dyes on a single piece of gear. This sounds like a great addition, giving the glamourheads even more customization to make their character look exactly how they want to. But instead for some reason, Square Enix decided to make it so that you don't get to choose what part of the gear get dyed. This leads to many issues of having to settle for less when the perfect gear you got doesn't dye the right way and you end up with not much of a point to adding the feature at all.\n\nGlossing over the other things, the graphics update looks great, but the land and scenery of Tural are a mixed bag. Some areas look great while others are boring, barren wastelands. All the usual departments did their job right. The music is fine and the dungeons are surprisingly great, yadda yadda. Mostly because the only department that got any kind of massive shifts in them was the writers.\n\nAt least Estinien got to have fun and Koana gets to build as many I-95s as he wants all over Tural.\n\nI hope we never have to deal with Tural and Wuk Lamutt ever again.", "timestamp_created": 1725254448, "timestamp_updated": 1725254646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60836714506149292", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "174040297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058754010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "15.5k hours in the game.\n\nI love this game with all my heart, it's been with me for a significant number of years now.\n\nI won't delve into the MSQ much as that has been widely touched on and while I don't agree with all criticisms regarding it It did feel like a slog similar to first run through of ARR honestly (back when it was longer).\n\nIf you exclude the MSQ, I would say the battle content/duties are phenomenal, the job upgrades however are nigh non-existent and while you get some visual changes in some jobs they all play identically or honestly worst given the clunkiness added by the continuation every buff ability received.\n\nWhile I have a more extreme achievement hunting play style, other than the (really good) fun I had in the MSQ dungeons, the fun only actually started when I started doing everything else.\n\nOverall the game has many things it could do better and while QoL things are being integrated seemingly randomly outside of expansions, it eludes to a deeper lack of transparency and apparent developer communication in regards to the now tiring formula of expansions. x number of dungeons, trials at these levels, raids have this many floors etc. That being said I still love many aspects of this game personally and I get my enjoyment out of it.\n\nIf you come for the MSQ honestly, expect to be disappointed if you haven't already seen all the reviews and discussions but keep an open mind, might be for you.\nIf you are here for battle content, while fights I feel are great, you'll probably log on once, twice or thrice a week to basically play the EW jobs and logout.\n\nI'll always recommend trying FFXIV though I'm on the fence with Dawntrail leaning to skippable.

People are quick to bring out Stormblood, but that expansion had some of the most content, some of the best raids, some of the best post patch stories, and the BEST abilities and class fantasy of any expansion EVER. HALF of the story of SB sucked, and people give it shit to this day, now imagine what DT does to the image of this game?\n\n It is SCARY to love this game right now, because if Dawntrail and Endwalker post patches are a trend, this game simply will have less to offer than it did in the past for the next decade. A game that used to have amazing story and amazing gameplay will now only have the gameplay, and thats a problem, because every single facet of the gameplay is tied to story, from dungeons to raids.\n\nNo, its not TERRIBLE. Its just less than it was. Which is fucking ridiculous considering how much time, money and love people invest into this game. This game is literally Squares golden goose that is keeping the company alive through flops like Forspoken, and yet it doesnt feel like any of the PRICEY costumes in the mogstation are being reinvested back in the game.\n\nThis game needs drastic measures to change, and fast. If this is what awaits us for the next 10 years, were truly screwed, and the game will slowly bleed out players as the MSQ becomes a bigger and bigger barrier of entry for new players, as it takes longer to complete, and becomes more and more boring with each passing xpac.\n\nSimply put, they have until the next expansion to fix it, or else im out. I dont think this is terrible or unplayable, but the thing is: Wow was never unplayable either, it just eroded in quality slowly until it became a grey slop that was a shadow of its former self. I refuse to let my love and good memories of this game be tainted by desperately trying to perform CPR in it while begging the devs to bring us back to the glory days, like it happened to other WoW players, who slowly lost their love and beautiful memories of an otherwise amazing game. The same way i refused to taint my beautiful memories of my time in Ragnarok Online, by playing the gacha mobile garbage Gravity releases every year bearing that franchises name, in a desperate, vain attempt to tap into nostalgia and great times past. Learning to let go is honestly the healthiest mindset when it comes to beloved franchises nowadays, and that is honestly kind of sad.\n\n'Twas a grand, glorious dream we shared.\nOf a world united. Of peace and prosperity.\nWe are ghosts, you and I.

Terrible pacing, shockingly bad voice acting, and atrocious, repetitive and laughably childish dialogue that makes me wonder how it ever was greenlit to begin with, and then Wuk Lamat, who is forced upon you at every turn.  I enjoyed Wuk Lamat in 6.55, but her omnipresence in 7.0 is diabolical. I found myself, for the very first time in the ten years I have been playing FFXIV, rushing through dialogue and clipping voiced cut scenes so I could get back to playing the game - which was a struggle in itself given that during the MSQ we're barely presented with the opportunity to actually play the game. It's a mess of \"Talk to Wuk Lamat\" > go here \"Talk to Wuk Lamat\" > do X thing for Wuk Lamat > \"Talk to Wuk Lamat\" > ... you get it.\n\nNormally, I'm excited and on the edge of my seat waiting for the big reveal and finale of the MSQ. That wasn't the case here. I felt bored, impatiently waiting for the credits to role so that I could finally do something fun, like the dungeons and trials which have been amazing so far - a bright spot in an otherwise terrible expansion.  I will say, though, that the level 100 trial was a disappointment for me. I didn't enjoy Wuk Lamat breaking through the ceiling for several reasons, but mostly because I'm tired of seeing that gimmick. We saw it in Shadowbringers (Thancred breaks through during Hades) and again in Endwalker (Zenos/Shinryu headbutting his way in during Endsinger). I am begging Square, please stop. It was awesome the first time, but now we just expect it and it's tired. \n\nWhile the trials and dungeons, and the newly released 8-man raids are very fun, I find it impossible to rate the game higher given that the draw for me and many others is the story, and it was unfortunately severely lacking.", "timestamp_created": 1725205690, "timestamp_updated": 1725205690, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547837495803833008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173997593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130278741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat is in poopcrap tier", "timestamp_created": 1725204692, "timestamp_updated": 1725204692, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474748432636260986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173994384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052708539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "EVERY.....SINGLE. .......

After the whole trial non-sense part was over, I felt this is where the story starts to really fall apart, the whole story of Zoraal Ja becoming king, and Sphere was the real villain felt so rushed, everything happend so fast and sudden that I could have no real feelings when Zoraal Ja was defeated nor cared about any of the characters like Otis and meeting his endless version of him.

You have the growth of a leader shown in Stormblood in the first half (Lyse -> Wuk Lamat).

It makes me feel more appreciative of other characters, particularly Bakool Ja Ja and Koana, who express great amounts of emotion in scenes where there is a period of change (Bakool Ja Ja vs. the truth of the blessed) (Bakool Ja Ja's haughty confident ego vs. Bakool Ja Ja feeling good about saving people) (Koana's stoicism vs. Koana's true wants/emotions) (Koana vs. the kidnapping of Wuk Lamat).

great\nTwo new classes are pretty good,\nNew raids are great and entertaining to rerun minus m2 (sorry i just don't like the bee song tbh)\nTwo dyes on some gear look great and look forward to see this expand as long as SE don't drop it\nGraphics updates were perfect and improved the look of the game greatly (for example, my elezen face doesn't have that line on the chin anymore which is perfect)\nMost classes feel good to play\n\n\n-cons\nStory isn't great, might improve in patches but honestly clocked out at this point\nSome classes still need improvements to be fine (drk being a main example)\nExpert dungeons are meh, Alexandria is fine but the other two are lackluster\nSome of the two dye gear was a bit lazy, it's fine for most but there was the odd bit of armour i spotted where i was disappointed\nDisappointed with the main villain, would have preferred a who expansion build up like heavensward, i had the same issue with endwalker so just saddened that they did a copy and paste job in a sense\nMonk still being treated as the class that's never clean by SE, personal gripe \nExpansion on shorting buttons into 1 wasn't expanded further, I would have liked how they did it in pvp to be an option for the main game (for example a classes 1-2-3 combo being shortened to one button to help reduce bloat on the UI)\n\nOverall most of the main content in the expansion is fine but since the game is focused on story I can't recommend it on that currently as i felt it took a continuous tumble since endwalker (in my opinion after the first half of endwalker as they played their hand too early). however if you like to run content mindlessly then by all means go for it since most of the dungeons are great to run and raids are perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1724566924,

dungeons, etc are good. Encounters this expansion have been a little better at not making me sleep. Jobs are still the same and pending changes in 8.x (lol). Enough was said regarding these in other reviews.\n\nNow the elephant in the room:\n\nSquare Enix's bad decision-making and its trend of \"going global\" (read Americanisation) has felt stronger this expansion. The same malign influence that had a hand in the creation of the disaster that is known as Forspoken has seeped into this game. The move to hire English VAs using an L.A studio has made them enter the American ecosystem and suffer its implications...\n\nThe result was an amateur VA (who claims to be of Latino descent) landing the role of the most important character and NPC in this expansion's story. As if the writing for the NPC and story was not dreadful enough, the VA had no range or ability to express emotions adequately and felt incredibly miscast. In fact, it is very much so; the VA was struggling to masquerade as a Latino woman which is proven by the fact that the the VA slips and stumbles whenever the NPC is required to yell or speak loudly. In fact, in the climax of the final battle, just as the player character beats the antagonist, the NPC intervenes just to \"yell quietly\" and sabotage the PC's triumphant moment to remind everyone that the true main character of this subpar story was not and is not the player. \n\nTl;dr: the substandard writing combined with the horribly miscast (EN only), omnipresent, and badly written NPC on which the expansion's story lives on or dies resulted in a very poor and unpleasant experience.\n\nP.S: That same VA has been slandering people on social media and calling for certain voice actors from other video games to \"step down\" for niche and impractical ideological reasons and overall being divisive. As if that was not enough, there is no separation between the VA and the NPC Wuk Lamat on social media, injecting one's personal life and views into a character that is owned by Square Enix and acting as you are one and the same while being publicly defamatory and hostile against the community for voicing their criticism of the expansion is completely unprofessional and endangering the reputation of Square Enix and potentially damaging its assets.", "timestamp_created": 1724542228, "timestamp_updated": 1724542228, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57235950231552124", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173272976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151383327", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "part of the \"certain sections\" of gamers", "timestamp_created": 1724540905, "timestamp_updated": 1724540905, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45416557788848877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173268202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067740953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "bad story", "timestamp_created": 1724535597, "timestamp_updated": 1724535597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522291302680969238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "173264926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065065463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat is the single worst voice actor in the whole game.

It's basically a visual novel (a horrible one) with a few bits of combat in between.\n\nJust avoid the expansion like the plague or skip everything, you're not missing out on anything but the context of why you fight some characters and that's it.\n\nP.S: One last thing, unless there was something I missed about Souls and Alexandria and unless they retcon it in future updates, Sphene is the absolute worst, most unredeemable villain in FF14 and Wuk Lamat is the greatest idiot in existence for forgiving here.\n\nHere's a hint: if you think about it for more than five seconds, you realize that Sphene basically deletes people from existence.

In fact, I even rank it top 3 of most enjoyable, behind Shadowbringers and Heavensward. However, once that initial \"this was fun\" moment for me passed, I do what I normally do and look over the whole story and go \"Was it actually any good though?\" That was when I realized that the reason I enjoyed Dawntrail when I played through it was because I completely turned my brain off to a certain cat girl character before I even finished the first two zones because I knew immediately what kind of character the devs were going to try and shove onto me for the entire MSQ. Unraveling the rest from there I wound up with the unsurprising answer of: \"Wow, Dawntrail's story is abysmal.\"\n\nWhile MOST of the music and the battle content were both quite enjoyable to me, ultimately what gets people playing this game is the Main Story Quest, or MSQ, and the MSQ for Dawntrail is as I stated above; Abysmal. MANY plot holes plague it from start to finish, with many constantly having you ask \"But why?\" over and over and over. Remember Ihih'hana? Apparently nobody else in  Kozama'uka does except Wuk Evu and the Hanu Hanu elder and they just decided to...never tell their village why taking the festival seriously was so important...BUT HEY WUK LAMAT FIGURED IT OUT SO NOW SHE IS OUR SAVIOR!!! \n\nYes, the name has been dropped: Wuk Lamat.\n\nYou're either going to love this character or hate her, and the ENTIRE EXPANSION rides on that single fact: if you love her, you'll probably love Dawntrail. If you hate her, you're going to have an awful time. People might joke she is \"furry Naruto\" but that is actually somewhat correct; if you take away any challenges and growth the actual Naruto character had during their series. Wuk Lamat is insanely one-dimensional. So much so you know her ENTIRE character before you even leave the beginning level 90 areas, and from start to finish through the entire MSQ, her \"Ninja Way\" of \"I REALLY love peace and happiness!\" gets her through literally anything and everything in her path in the most perfect ways possible. Who knew all it took to stop a centuries long eugenics project that an entire species of people have been dealing with was just give them some seeds to grow something other then bananas along with the power of friendship???\n\nEven the CHARACTERS are all made to accommodate Wuk Lamat. A child overhears that you are going to kill their father? Just say you want to get to know them and then share a meal with them and watch as they don't care anymore AND want to be best friends with you too! You like spunky and sassy Alisaie? Well you'll be glad to know she lost all of that and becomes a generic \"Yes Man\" for Wuk Lamat! Remember when the devs hyped up Krile as having a BIG part in this MSQ? Sorry; I hope you enjoy Krile getting a basic nothing-burger story pulled from the \"generic plot\" hat because Wuk Lamat needed a few more hours of screentime talking about how much she loves Peace and happiness and understanding people for the hundredth time.\n\nDespite the story constantly telling us of Wuk Lamat's growth as a character, never once is it shown: from beginning to end, she acts the EXACT same way, and the story rewards her every step of the way for it. Wuk Lamat is the definition of a \"Black Hole Sue\" character, and the ENTIRE story caters to that, constantly making it so everything she does resolves in the most perfect way possible at all times for her, and that all characters either exist to validate her one-dimensional character, or \"build\" her character through \"confrontation\". She even gets her own Zenos AND Emet Selch characters to confront!...One who is literally written to be a Saturday morning villain names Edgy McEdgelord with Daddy issues who is suppose to be her \"big rival\", and another who she becomes best friends with even though she wants to genocide our world!\n\nI won't even dig into the English Voice Acting, but if you want to play but cannot handle the english; switch to Japanese voices, or even the French/German voices, it will make it slightly more manageable.\n\nI could go on and on, about more plot holes and strange music choices and character decisions, but I will just end it with this: I personally enjoyed MY playthrough of Dawntrail. However, my personal enjoyment doesn't suddenly mean all of the issues just vanish and don't suddenly exist for other players. Regardless of how much I enjoyed my playthrough, with both the music and battle content: critically thinking about this entire story, which IS the main selling point for this series, from start to end just shows it is an insult to the players and everything that came before it, and I cannot recommend Dawntrail based on what MSQ story we were given. Even Endwalker, as much as I hated that expansion with both it's MSQ and post MSQ stories, was better then this.\n\nDawntrail is literally a speedrun of \"FF14's greatest hits collection of the past several expansions\" centered around someone's single fursona OC, without ANY of the buildup or payoff.\n\nSo SMILE, and let the rainbow sing...\nBecause Wuk Lamat needs you to talk to 3 more people for her before speaking with her again.

Even if you were indifferent you will feel the fatigue. \n\nWuk is all at once the least interesting person in any given room with the least to say and the least qualified to rule, only the Dawnservant due to pure nepotism, given the one non-relative of the current ruler had to win a whole tournament to compete it's fair to say that it's her sole qualification. Without any actual special skills and a total lack of knowledge of her own lands, despite the other siblings seemingly able to go out and do their own thing it really does seem like they just stared at a wall for so many years. Even most forms of exposition are taken up by Erenville leaving Wuk to speak and say nothing. 'Speak To Wuk Lamat' as a quest objective gave me more dread than 'Return To The Waking Sands'.\n\nThe whole story warps around the black hole that is the cat princess. Other characters who join in on the journey take a back seat leading to their own plot arcs being overshadowed or rushed to get back to her. Krile suffering the most and then some. Wuk's english voice acting is well known for lacking quality direction and a certain line close the ending was delivered so poorly it's become something of a meme. Despite this Wuk takes so much time from others that it ruins others characters arcs. Implications of other Scions competing never truly happens which was a let down to see them interact with some sparring at least or see some development, but that might be time that the audience isn't going 'Where's Cat Poochie?'. If Wuk is the 'Main Character' of the expansion them being so bland and annoying is incredibly damning, and getting Bleach level power ups when the plot demands it through the justification of 'Resolve' does have the implication several beloved characters just didn't want to live as much as this annoying cat.\n\nEven the broader plot suffers from a similar problem Endwalker had of a game of two halves. The front half involving interactions with the various groups of Tural feels incredibly underbaked. Many of them have a whole entire group wide personality trait and their issues get resolved all too quickly.

Everyone knew after Endwalker, Dawntrail was never going to beat it, this was the lull time. Maybe we'll be chilling beach on downtime and finding Krile's grandfather. Nope lol, we're actually npc for this expansion, guess thats one way to chill... just dont have your character in this expansion at all. I've never wanted to skip a part of MSQ ever in any part of FFXIV, not even during ARR. 90-95 you could literally skip it after hearing Wuk Lamat say she wants to use the power of friendship to bring peace because thats all you're going hear for 10+ hours. You genuinely wouldn't miss anything. Did I forget to mention that Wuk Lamat got seasick or airsick again. No, well I hope you enjoy that plot line for 5+ hours. \n\nWuk Lamat drama on her VA, I genuinely couldn't care less about. The VA was done poor, but  I'm more concern with how the character itself directed by the game was done insanely poorly. She plays like a Naruto character that wants to become hokag- sorry Dawnservant that has the usefulness of Sakura and has more screentime than Naruto in Naruto. Statistically if you talk to someone in this expansion there is a 33% chance (147 quest asking to talk to her) it was Wuk Lamat and 20% chance voice acting wise she is talking and a 100% chance she is yapping over someone else's dialogue so nobody else can talk. Genuinely never seen a character in FFXIV get this much screen time. I suppose this is a new idea, but lets not do this again. Send her straight to Lyse gulag never to be seen again so I dont have to see her pop up when the new end of time comes like she's Zenos in final trial screaming about the power of friendship and having it work on the boss. \n\nLike hell even the antagonist go through more growth than her and they got friendship no jutsu out of their entire character, just like how the scions and you're character become her minions that forgot who they are and what their characters were. I swear this expansion was a fanfic because the scions were unrecognizable, they just didn't act themselves.\n\nI don't care that my character ended up being some npc that was utterly useless. The pacing was poor, the screentime for other character was atrocious. I dont need to be the main character, but if you're going to force one on me at least make the character interesting, not some generic main character in Shounen Jump, but don't even commit to the shounen Genre. Pick one.\n\n\nBesides her the expansion was pretty good, she really soured the entire thing honestly which is rather impressive. Not surprising though considering she was 90% of the expansion since she yapped over everyone else and friendship no jutsu the rest. I'm insanely disappointed for the talk about going to battling it out with scions that was discussed end up being a nothingburger cuz suqare enix chickened out of it. \n\n4/10 expansion where 5/10 is ARR cuz at least ARR build stuff up that was interesting.\n\nFinal note let me give you a tally on the yap meter of how much she talks\n7000 words for Wuk Lamat\nErenville the freaking narrator got 2k\nnext closest to Wuk Lamat was 3.5k\nKrile you know the scion this expansion was suppose to be about got barely above 1k words\nAll of the scions combined have less than 3k, so that was including Krile's 1.1k\nSo if we ignored that one character with 3.5k and combined all the characters in dawntrail ALL the other ones, they would have less words than Wuk Lamat.

Between having to have Wuk constantly being the main character (derogatory) and the half-baked graphical update, I cannot in good faith say that this is a decent expansion, let alone an \"okay\" expansion. The areas are too big. Even with flying unlocked, it takes forever to traverse from one end to another.\nI do not understand the point of updating the face models, but leaving everything below the neck extremely polygonal. They updated the body textures too, which is pointless when the models are still stuck in the past. I feel like the tron-esque designs are very out of place, especially considering that it's not too far from the first expansion (map wise, it's very close west). The music is sub-par, and the voice acting is atrocious. Some lines sound like they were recorded from the voice actor's phone. I'd like to talk more about how much I hate the voice acting, but I fear that I will be targeted for wrongthink.\nBack to the graphics, the world textures are barely updated, and looks very jarring when you have a high quality textured table on a floor that you can count the pixels on. The new lighting system is decent, but the shadows are still very low quality. The lighting now passes through large hats, meaning if you have a light directly on top of you, the top half of your face will be lighted and the bottom will be in the shade, which doesn't make sense.\n\nEdit: 2024/09/14\nThe shadows, are actually decent, it's just the \"soft shadows\" setting is very poorly implemented, and that some areas (namely Gridania's market board area) still use the old lighting system for no reason.\n\nSquare Enix said that there's issues with the faces, and the main issue everyone seems to have is the philtrum actually exist now.

Worst and most boring expansion ever!\n\nI've been a long-time fan of FF14. I absolutely loved the world and story of FF14, but I am deeply disappointed. After much deliberation, I've decided to cancel my subscription. Thank you for everything up until now.\n\nThe main issues I had were: 1) The negative changes to the scenery and Hyur faces after the graphic update, 2) Everything about Uklamat, and 3) The boring storyline. The only positives were the music and the novelty of the new areas.\n\n1) Changes to Scenery and Hyur Faces after the Graphic Update\nDecreased Quality of Scenery\nI used to love the scenery in FF14 and often took photos while wandering around as part of my daily life, but that\u2019s no longer possible. After the update, many of the landscapes experienced dramatic negative changes. Not only the lighting, but also extremely unnatural fog and haze effects were added, making it impossible to enjoy the beautiful views anymore. Did the graphics team even check this? Please tell me. How could an update make things so disappointing? Many Warriors of Light have posted in the forums under \"Opinions, Requests, and Discussions on the Graphic Update,\" so please check it out.\n\nDecreased Quality of Hyur Faces\nAlthough Hyurs may be a minor character type, the drastic change was so shocking that I couldn't play for over a month after purchasing the DLC. The strange shadows on their faces, the overemphasis on tear bags, and the discomfort around the mouth and philtrum are very sad. I used to take a lot of close-up screenshots, but now, I hardly do. Once again, what exactly did the graphics team check to determine that this update was equal to or better than before? I demand a detailed explanation.\n\n2) Everything about Wuk Lamat\nI won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but it\u2019s truly awful. If you say it\u2019s because of the character setting, then that\u2019s that, but I cannot stand the appearance, personality, attitude, speech, and motivations. I couldn't empathize with them at all.\n\n3) The Boring Storyline\nI won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but it\u2019s far more tedious than the Realm Reborn storyline.

Unlike the previous DLCs, where I was so engrossed in the story, I was surprised by how overwhelmingly sleepy and bored I was this time.\n\nCan you please stop relying so heavily on cutscenes? Players don't want to only watch cutscenes; they want to immerse themselves in the story. Cutscenes are just a means to an end, not the end itself. With an already poor story that fails to engage, the constant cutscenes were just too much. There were multiple moments where I thought, \"Let me control the character and experience this as a mini-game!\" Instead, all we got was following, following, accompanying, accompanying, and more zoom-ins.

To start of on why lets talk about hte elephant in the room or should i say cat WUK Lamat personally at first i loved her character and was excited to explore the depth this character help but when i went to dive into the deep end i was met with a face full of concrete which is to say Wuk Lamat has the depth of a kiddy pool when i comes to Character growth She starts off as a Peace and Taco loving Cat that is desperate to prove her self and evolved into the NEVER WRONG Peace and Taco loving Cat that Proved herself in no point in the story was she faced with a challange that she couldnt over come with her view of \"if i learn about you past i can change you into someone who becomes my friend\" her hyper positively was OK at first the problem is IT NEVER ENDED even when she faced TWO of the most heart breaking moments where her views SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHALLANGED she instead made a SINGULAR EXCEPTION. when her brother layed there dying he put how he felt out there and SHE TOLD HIM HE WAS WRONG at no point did she try to understand her brothers feelings of being placed with a world of expectations and being told HE WOULD BE AIR TO THE THRONE only for is father to constantly dot on his adoptive sister. (ps just realised this but she was more sympathetic to a genocidal Queen then her own Brother)\n\nI would've been able to over look this if at any point in the story the was a point where we stopped travelling with Wok lamat but the one time we separate from her she re enters the story and takes hold of and doesn't let go i dont know what square enix was thinking when the decided to give Wuk Lamat more screen time then our own character in the MSQ story. I personally feel as though i (As the WoL) could have been taken out of the story and not much would've chnaged every time it felt like something started to need only my touch there was Wuk lamat to steal the spotlight (ie The Final Trail) i can comfortable that the over arching story of dawntrail COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD but in my opinion they pushed wuk lamat way too hard and if the eased off and maybe gave her less scenes and made her struggle a bit she could've been a better character but because they didnt she will forever be compared to Lyse as an Expansion Wrecker\n\nNow to talk about the good in this expansion EVERYTHING ELSE\n\nso ill make this brief as i haven't done too much but the Dungeon environment was so well built i found myself wanting to stop and take in the dungeon itself and they did this for every dungeon. Next Trails and Bosses, HOLY SHIT these things were amazing some of the hardest non-Extreme boss fights to date with amazing battles that kept me on my toes and hooked into the fight at all time i wanna almost say that these bosses were better then some of my all time favourites. Finally the overworld, MAN what else is there to say then this is BEAUTIFUL each area felt extremely unique and large biggest to date if im not wrong and despite their size they dont lack in detail i am definitely gonna spent a few days just exploring these places to find all the cool spots.\n\nOverall this expansion could have been the best even beating out SHB but the writing team really fumbled when it came to the exacution of charatcers and the overall theme of the story i wish we had spent less with Wuk Lamat and more with Erenville and Krile, The ladder being what i was most upset about as i had thought going into this expansion that the ladder half might focus on her looking at the path her Grandfather took and to find out why he was in Tuliyolal but that didnt happen these two character were relgated to the side and only came out to shine very briefly every now and then so with all that said i cant give this expansion higher then a 4/10 and its only better then SB due to how amazing the other content that was added was.

That accent is contrived and disingenuous to the point of bordering on \"offensive caricature\".  His delivery is repeatedly flat and utterly unconvincing.  This abomination sounds like a complete amateur amidst a cast of professionally trained experts with actual stage presence and it's so jarring a contrast as to disrupt the entire experience.  It's akin to trying to stuff some TrashTok clout-junkie into a blockbuster Hollywood feature film and it shows.  Late night softcore Skinemax flicks' scripts were delivered more convincingly and professionally in their heyday.

Dawntrail is Divisive, and I agree.  Spoilers below.\n\nLet me up front with this; the game play for the dungeons, trials, and raids has be wonderful; its the writing for the story and the quality of the voice work and sound mixing that has made this a negative review expansion for me. First off the writing is very \"Shonen-esque\" with new main character Wuk Lamat. Sena delivers some great voice work here and there; no question, but the lines she has to repeat many times either verbatim or some variation of the lines just grinds on you after awhile. I will also admit I that do not care for Shonen anime style characters that are bubbly and naive and the center of attention. What ends up happening is that DT puts all the focus from beginning to end of 7.0 on Wuk, and its just an overload. I will also admit... that her showing up in that one CS did annoy me. Mainly because it was our big shindig and she just comes in... that and now we'll have to see that CS every time it shows up on the roulette.\nSecondly the voice work as a whole is all over the place. Most of the main cast are great and the mixing is fine. But then you get into all the side MSQ characters who have North American VA's - something new with this expac - and their volume levels are so much higher than the rest of the cast. Its very much a mixing issue. One other little issue with the side NA cast is that they dont put any emotion into their lines when they obviously should be. So many lines are delivered flatter than a pancake,  it makes you wonder if SIDE bothered to give them a voice director, or do multiple takes.\nOddly enough for being the expansion with the LONGEST msq it feels the most rushed. In a way its running into the same issue Stormblood has - two stories that should have been given their own expansions with time to breathe. I think this is the cause of my next criticism that has been floating around in my head - Dawntrail just feels so empty or unfinished.\nIn all the other expansions it wasnt uncommon for there to be Yellow side quests that would have followups side plots to spawn new yellow quests to carry on the mini plot. I've done all the side quests in DT and only the blues had their quest chains. The crafter and gatherer side quests in the capital city dont have a capstone quest like we got for the Crystalline Mean or Studium deliveries. If you do decide to speak to the original quest giver he just says something like \"Hi thanks for doing my job. I knew you could do it.\" Then there is the second city Solution Nine.... its more or less empty. Yeah there are some npc's but unlike Radz at Han there is no reason to keep going back except for the raid quests, and that is in only one TINY little corner of the city.", "timestamp_created": 1723609464, "timestamp_updated": 1723648432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497894555330276489", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172084235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135430257", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The Disney-esque song at then end of the MSQ was the final nail in the coffin.", "timestamp_created": 1723605898, "timestamp_updated": 1723605898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48655170202255249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172070582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042105990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen.\n\nDon't play it in English is not a line I thought I would be dropping in this game, at least for this expansion.

I want to preface that this review is for the story elements of Dawntrail alone and that general gameplay through dungeons and trails, new items, graphics, and the music BY GOD THE MUSIC is masterfully done. However the story falls flat and really misses the mark. I found my self saying \"Wow A Realm Reborn had a better story :/\"\n\nThe best recap of what it feels like to play through Dawntrail is that you the warrior of light are a side character to Wuk Lamat. The real main character of the Dawntrail story. Did you want to see your character in cut scenes? Well Wuk Lamat is actually the one reacting to everything speaking and making the calls. Many shots of the warrior of light is just standing silently behind Wuk Lamat not doing anything or reacting while she yaps. Wuk Lamat has a story that could work but fails on execution as her development comes first in priority to everything else in the story including the player. Not to say that the Warrior of light needs to always have the spot light but by playing through Dawntrail my WoL was a glorified NPC as the spotlight was constantly on Wuk Lamat trying to do simple tasks and pouting being upset and trying to be a heroic leader.  \n\nTaking the spotlight away completely from the person who is paying the game was a bad choice. Its ok when a NPC has a chance to develop or we follow their story arc aside from our own for a few quests in fact I think thats important to develop the character but despite every single quest in dawntrail being focused on Wuk Lamat I dont see how she has developed as a character. She only really seems to have gained confidence which makes her character more painful as the more confidence she gains the more talking she does taking more and more time just watching her from the back line.\n\nI found myself actually doing the random yellow side quests in Dawntrail because those small side quests actually had a better story line than the MSQ. I felt I was actually helping or doing something important when doing those quests even if small. The MSQ just seemed kinda goofy just doing everything Wuk Lamat asked for like my WoL was a puppet to the main character furry DMPC. Wuk Lamat cant tie her shoes? \"WoL I have a job for you!\"\n\nAt the end of Endwalker I was actually worried for Dawntrail because I didnt know what or how they were going to improve dungeons or make new trail bosses, but they blew my expectations out of the water. My only complaint is the MSQ but seeing as you have to do the MSQ to do the dungeons and post game content you have to witness Wuk Lamat. Unless you buy a story skip. I hate that I sit down and think that wow I wish I would have skipped this story completely. Ive always advocated for new players to take their time playing and to enjoy the story or any aspects that they like and leveling the classes. I disliked that this almost feels like a way to try to get people to buy a story skip because of how bad it is. \n\nI have to mention that the 2nd half of the story does get better as you get to the end but sadly the first half just ruined my mood by showing Wuk Lamat try to be all sunshine and rainbows yet being unable to really do anything important. The 2nd half has some likeable characters and I enjoyed the last 10% ish of the story but still my judgment on Wuk Lamat ruining the first half stands.\n\nThe FFXIV team is one of my favorite development teams because they actually play their game and listen to the community. I am however pretty hopeful and pretty confident in the FFXIV team to learn from how poorly this expansion was received and make more fulfilling future content. This feels like a slip up for the series and its certainly hard to follow Shadow bringers and End walker but im hopeful that things get better from here. \n\nShould you play the game? Yes even only if to experience the rest of the game outside the story, but as I have enjoyed the story of the game up to here this was a huge letdown and I really hope the next expansion is written with more direction and more focus of the journey of the player of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1723574871, "timestamp_updated": 1723576423, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497225791215896606", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172054572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042245836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Disappointing.", "timestamp_created": 1723568658, "timestamp_updated": 1723568658, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542583465576171875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "172050071", "author": {"steamid": "76561199522068763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Info dumping is not world-building.

We were promised a \"beach episode\" and I was ready for whimsical times with the scions and the newly introduced Wuk Lamat. Instead we got some of the most abysmal world building I have experienced in recent memory mixed with tedious quests, a ridiculous plot, and insultingly phoned in characters.\n\nThe absolute lack of good character writing is the greatest crime of this expansion. Everyone is the equivalent of a cardboard cutout. Even Wuk Lamat, who eats up 95% of the expansion with her incessant preaching of \"peace and happiness\" (with no actual plan to preserve said peace), has the most lackluster and boring character arc. Apparently learning about the people you are trying to rule over is the only qualification for leadership when really that should be considered the bare minimum.\n\nI came out this MSQ with over a hundred questions concerning the world building and plot decisions. Normally I can suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment, but Dawntrail has no respect for your time nor your intelligence.\n\n[spoiler] Galool Ja Ja, a blessed sibling of the Mamool Ja, who has ruled over Tural for 80 years, did absolutely nothing to stop the eugenic breeding of blessed siblings and did nothing to solve their food crisis, which we solved in a day by importing plants (because NO ONE thought of this!!!???) [/spoiler] \n\nOn a positive note: The new zones are beautiful, the music is stellar as always, dungeons and raids are awesome, the new jobs are fun to play, the graphics update is lovely, but the story is just so unbelievably in the trenches it absolutely soured everything. \n\nI absolutely adore FFXIV, one of the my all time favorite games, and I will continue to play it. I only hope that, in the future, more care is given to the world and characters. \n\nI post a negative review, NOT to deter anyone from playing FFXIV, please play this amazing game!

Job rotations and fights have been homogenized and made easier than ever.\n\nThe developers seem to lack ideas for advancing the game, leaving it on life support to generate revenue for other projects. As a veteran player, I find the current state of the game profoundly disappointing, even to the point of disgust. Square Enix appears to neglect this game, diverting its revenue to other endeavors. The lack of investment and care is evident.\n\nFundamental problems persist, such as buff/debuff limits, server tick issues, and slow, unevolved combat. These issues result in restricted fight design, rigid damage profiles, and simplified DPS and healing optimizations compared to past content. The developers seem to be intentionally removing complexity for the sake of accessibility and profitability.\n\nThis expansion has also killed any interest I and many other players had in the story.

You want to enjoy that raised level cap, more gear options, more jobs, more hunts to go on, more mounts to find, and just more things to see in general. If you are wondering if you want to get into this MMO, this expansion will not be the one that likely sells it to you.\n\n\nThis expansion has a lot to prove given the long story arc leading up to it, and so that likely makes some of the negativity it is receiving at least somewhat unfair. I waited to finish the expansion, and I took my time doing it as well. The introduction of mediocre characters does not have to make the story bad, but constantly forcing them into center stage is going to make what short comings they might have all the harder to ignore. Some of the new cast members are there enough to help you get an idea of who they are and what they are about, and then they do not overstay their welcome. Which is a good thing. But I no longer have an overarching story to help give focus to the direction that I am going, instead I am getting info dumped in the first half. The music is passing in some cases or good in others, but if it stood out to me it was for the wrong reasons. It is not all bad, there is lots to enjoy like the scenery or the developers continuing to build on battle mechanics to make them more engaging, but it gets pulled aside and held up too often by jarring interactions or a reminder that you as the player have been pushed out of the position you held for so much else of the story before this so that you can be something else, something less in my opinion.\n\nThese are my feelings after I tried to sit down and make sense of the many times that I felt bothered or simply taken out of the experience while I tried to go through the main story to unlock the content.

I know it also happened before (Secondary character syndrome, I mean) but this time it is insufferable. \nWe as player killed many gods, defeated the literal void incarnated, saved an empire while destroying another, and much more. yet we can't deal with a stupid little lizard with no background or power!? WHY WERE WE ALONE DOING THE OTHER EPIC THINGS. WHY DID THEY (Dawntrail characters) NEVER CHIME IN DURING THE GALAXY-WIDE TROUBLES!?\nWhy do we have to gather bird poop? To avoid fighting but then fight anyway because the narrative is useless since the enemies placement prevent the narrative from working at all.\nTime travel never worked. \nHere's a huge spoiler : I'm warning you the next little paragraph is a huge spoiler: \n\nThe end boss is a secretary turned robot because he was mad his candidate didn't win the election so he sent power rangers to destroy the city FROM THE FUTURE. and THEN he went to the future for the first time and then went back to the past in the future from the future past (BS). And in order to fight him we have to waste our time ruining a cyber-city memory server and chasing a hologram around. Hologram was an android hiding from us because in the past from the future alternate dimension someone told her something and did whatever. then we gather more poop and watch other npc do stuff while we wait for the last chapter.\n\nI am not kidding.\nQoL-wise this expansion is a huge success. New raids, new glams, new functions, more gameplay, more features, etc. Everything from the utility side is amazing. MSQ Duty are better than ever. \nStory-wise nothing makes sense and we are not even needed. The only thing we as player have any agency or worth is defeating the last boss who is SOMEHOW stronger than all the gods and voids combined.... and is a robot from the future-past-future. Everything up until then can be left to the NPC. You literaly can not progress in the story without telling the NPC to do their thing or ask them how to progress and then watch them do it in your stead. Crop issues? Do lots of work toward fixing the issues and then watch an NPC fix it for you instead. Bandits? watch NPC deal with them... and go gather bird poop instead. Weird invasion? Follow the NPC around until the issue is fixed. Out of the 6 or so required solo duty for story, you only have to act in 2 of them, and one of those two is you playing as an NPC. YOU DO NOT MATTER. You are more of a sideline character than ever before.\nIt's great that the story doesn't need a hero. but why do we have to stand there and watch at all? It's infuriating. Wish I could go back and skip everything.\n\nit had so much promises at the start. We were promised a city of gold, new adventures, new exploration, new world.... We got auto-travel, deceptions, same-old, sent to the sideline... And the lore is basically 6 line of text for the whole continent. COuntry bad, new king did this and that, new country good, now need heir, select heir though trials repeating good king story.\n\nWhile the new mechanics and functions are great, I can not in all honnesty recommend this expansion. You are not needed in the story, why would you want to participate only to be told to gather poop as the MAIN QUEST. TWICE!

I don't care that this is a controversial statement to make, it needs to be called out and is carrying similar patterns to other media. \n\nSecondly, the storywriting, which was the main draw of FF14, is not good. \n\nI'll address the main problem first: Wuk Lamat. At the onset of the story, it doesn't seem like she'll be a bad character. However, the annoyances really start adding up when she starts receiving undue credit for other people's accomplishments or ideas, undeserved praise for things she has not earned, or the upteenth time when an NPC recognizes she's a princess. \n\nShe is the main character of the this expansion, not you. The idea could have been novel - playing the mentor to a young grasshopper trying to become a hero in his or her own right. That is not what we are given here.  It is very much in the style of Lyse from Stormblood - in all the ways I didn't enjoy then, either.\n\nThat is the first half of the story.  Don't get me wrong - there are some nice and interesting moments, this story is not good. Furthermore, we were promised larger roles for some other beloved characters that are again pushed aside for Wuk Lamat.\n\nThe second half of the story does not make significant improvements to this. It is very much copying the homework of other expansion packs and does not deliver nearly as skillfully.\n\nThis review is not blind hatred for a particular character. I went into this expansion with measured expectations, expecting something on the level of the better parts of Stormblood or A Realm Reborn. \n\nOn the whole, it is better than A Realm Reborn simply by virtue of the improvements made over years to the game itself.

It doesn't really matter if you like it or not, you're going to end up buying it, because otherwise you're going to be in dead content zones that nobody really frequents. That said, below are my thoughts on the game's storyline and general gameplay additions\n\n\nSTORYLINE - 1/5\nI simply cannot fathom how this game's story made it past a quality assurance team. It's like not a singular person on the development team decided to play their own game to find out if it was actually interesting or fun.\nThe overwhelming majority of storyline quests involves following or talking to NPCs, watching cutscenes, and hearing the primary character, Wuk Lamat, talk like a shounen protagonist in a manga written for kindergardeners. Unless you find it enjoyable sitting and watching a movie while you occasionally get a prompt to walk somewhere and talk to someone, it's simply not fun.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of plotholes that come in a variety of forms. Sometimes you will have scenes that have ominous dialogue that seems to be alluding to events yet to come, that ultimately goes nowhere as if the writers had simply forgotten about it. Often you get plot revelations that don't really make sense given prior context, as if one of the writers quit midway through production and all his replacement had to work with was half-legible bar napkins that contained important story beats, and he blew his nose with around a third of them before realizing how important they were. I am only around 15 hours into the storyline, and this stuff is so prevalent that I have simply stopped caring about the storyline. It doesn't respect your intelligence and it's not interesting enough to turn your brain off to.\n\nI have literally gotten to the point where I don't even want to play through the main storyline quests anymore because they are so boring, so stupid, and so poorly written. I've spent the last two weeks just playing PvP and the Gold Saucer. If you take absolutely nothing else from my review, it should be this; I literally view the MSQ of Dawntrail as a chore, not content that is enjoyable or interesting. On its face, that is absolutely damning.\n\nNone of this is helped by the fact that the primary character the story revolves around, Wuk Lamat, is very obnoxious, childishly written, and is utterly omnipresent. You literally cannot escape this character for more than 5 minutes at a time save for an hour or so in a segment partway through the game. Even after a pivotal point in the storyline where it would logically conclude her presence in the storyline, she finds a way to worm her way back into the story and the writers seem bound and determined to make everything revolve around her, to a degree that borders on satirical. It doesn't help that Wuk Lamat's English voice actor is utterly terrible; a lack of range and emotion makes the character monotonous and strange to listen to, which is again compounded by the fact that the character is inescapable. I don't know where they found Wuk Lamat's English voice actor, but do yourself a favor and switch to Japanese voices. It doesn't help with the bad writing, but at least Wuk Lamat's Japanese voice actress was capable of some emotion in her voice.\n\nIn brief, the storyline of Dawntrail (the actual writing, the character it revolves around, and the actual gameplay of the storyline quests) are shockingly bad. It is an extreme and obvious step in quality below any prior expansion, and after Shadowbringers it frankly gave me whiplash with how bad it was. I was so bored and so begrudged playing through it that I eventually have just started avoiding doing it because it's simply not fun.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY - 3/5\nThe new gameplay elements introduced by Dawntrail is primarily just a new set of dungeons, raids, and a pair of classes, the Viper and the Pictomancer. As I have not gotten to the new raids yet, I won't be commenting on those.\n\nThe Viper and Pictomancer are decent enough additions to the game and are enjoyable enough to play. I have found myself enjoying Viper the most of the melee dps classes, though I don't quite like Pictomancer a lot due to aesthetic reasons, but it definitely has its fans. I can't rightly say they are especially fun or interesting, but they are decent new content and have their own class quests with a mini storyline to go through, which were incidentally more interesting than the main storyline of Dawntrail to me.\n\nThe developers have indicated in prior interviews that Dawntrail's battle content was supposed to be harder than older expansions, but the general dungeon design remains the same as ever. You fight two groups of monsters, you fight a mini boss, and then you repeat this two more times at which point you fight the dungeon boss instead of a mini boss. The mechanics are fun enough but don't come off as particularly unique or hard, at least not enough to warrant praise. In general, it's more of the same. Maybe this is different in the raid content of the game; again, I haven't gotten to that point yet.\n\n\nMUSIC - 3/5\nThe music of the game is a mixed batch. Some of it feels strangely inappropriate; the South American styled city of Tuliyolla has jazz music in it. It definitely has nothing on The Crystarium, Sharlayan, or Ishgard's themes. Other themes are better; the zone music is generally pleasant to listen to, but again, nothing particularly stands out to me. I haven't heard all the themes, but as of about halfway into the main storyline, it's so far nothing to write home about. \n\n\nGRAPHICS - 4/5\nThe graphics update looks fairly nice in general but it's worth noting that it actually introduced some new and interesting problems to older content. For example, a couple bosses in the Nier raids look noticeably worse, which was very strange to see. That said, player characters are almost uniformly an upgrade, and the zones of Dawntrail are generally quite beautiful and very interesting to look at. Overall a few downsides in regards to how it affected older content, but the newer content looks great and characters look better\n\n\nMISC FEATURES - 1/5\nThe advertised 2 dye channel update to the game's dye system is very disappointing frankly. Most armor and weapons simply don't have a 2nd dye channel as they haven't been updated, and of those that do have a 2nd dye channel, a worryingly large number of them only let you dye a tiny and almost invisible part of the article of clothing. For instance, there's a Tonberry outfit in the game; the primary dye channel lets you dye the robe, and the secondary dye channel only affects a tiny string the robe you won't even notice unless you zoom all the way in and carefully look for it. Why even pretend there's a meaningful thing to dye? Very disappointing\n\n\n\n\nOVERALL - 2/5\nIf Dawntrail was its own stand alone game, absolutely nobody would buy it. The story is awful, the characters are terrible, and the gameplay and music is ok but simply nothing special, and many of the features the developers advertised largely aren't even implemented. The graphics are improved and there's new content to do, but that's about all the positives. That said, it's an MMO expansion, so if you are interested in keeping up in the gear and content treadmill, you'll be buying Dawntrail. That is not a recommendation, it's just a statement of fact. \nDawntrail is probably going to be the reason I let my sub lapse.

In fact Pictomancer is probably going to be my main DPS job moving forward forever.\n\nThere are some really cool looking mounts to earn\n\nThe quest areas are beautiful save the last one (you'll call me crazy for saying that at first then you'll get it) and the main cities are well laid out.\n\nCons:\nSpeak with Wuk Lamat. You wanted to hang out with all the other characters you've been getting to know for the past 6 expansions? No, speak with Wuk Lamat.\nYou wanted to learn more about Krile's grandfather who got sent the letter that kicked off this WHOLE STORY? No, speak with Wuk Lamat. We'll cram all that in for about 2 quests at the very end of the story so we can say we got to that but not do Krile's story any justice whatsoever or give it the time and energy it deserved. Which is INFURIATING because for the few moments we get of Krile's story, there are really interesting lore bits which tie back to the scholar's story from ARR, the most recent varient dungeon that came out, and Lalafell history in general which was REALLY interesting and I can't help but wonder what the world would look like if the whole story was like that.\n\nInstead there's an entire 4 hour long quest zone where you learn the cultural significance of a rainbow colored banana. I wish I was joking and I will never let them live that down. But hey, I'd forgive all the forced dialogue with Wuk Lamat if she had anything interesting to say, but more often than not she just has the CW dialogue where she borderline stares at the camera and tells the audience how they should be feeling the entire time. Hell everybody does, it's like they got somebody to write the msq who's only ever written like 3 sidequest chains before... oh wait...\n\nThe whole thing feels like a bad 30 hour long beast tribe daily where all of the characters you've come to love run off on their own and pawn you off with the new main character of the entire story because she's so annoying none of them want to be around her for more than 5 minutes, I kid you not every single quest area Wuk Lamat insists on going with you or dragging you around and EVERYONE is like \"y'know what i'm good I think I'll stay out here/go with someone else you got it tho\" without fail, you never get to hang out with anyone but Wuk Lamat. \n\nWhich stems from this expansion trying to have your character step back from \"super cool main character that everybody loves\" for a while to tell a more low stakes story after going to space and fighting gods last expansion, which hey I get it, and I was REALLY on board at first, but after you get Wuk Lamat her throne, about halfway through the story, and things start to get serious again, they don't let go of her being the new main character and she continues to insist on butting in and being the main character still completely overstaying her welcome for the back half of the story and becoming annoying FAST, and they really thought all of the FFIX nostalgia and fanservice would be enough to distract people and make them forgiving of the absolute slog this entire thing was, I'd say it's worse that Stormblood at points. I won't even touch on how boring Erenville is here or i'd be writing a novel.\n\nTL:DR all of the content is fantastic, the jobs are fun, but the meat of the expansion, the story, is mind numbingly dull and downright annoying. you won't miss anything at all if you look up what the 2-4 quests that actually have to do with Krile are and skip everything else.", "timestamp_created": 1722668783, "timestamp_updated": 1722670281, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524114727973937988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171330151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157413898", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Gaming is fun.\nStorywriting is bad.\n\nIt's just a Yawntrail.", "timestamp_created": 1722654428, "timestamp_updated": 1722654428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569596946239471436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171326177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079003377", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "You know, ever since I was feeling burned out and underwhelmed with the lack of content from the Post Patches for Endwalker, I decided not to get my hopes up very much about Dawntrail that was announced a while back.

That being said, I waited it out for a few weeks past the launch date as I minding my own business with other games until I decided to give the expansion a try and then...\n\n[h1]WTF IS THIS?![/h1]\nFor the first time worth of story and content that has lasted for 10 years from A New Realm Reborn, Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers, Endwalker and then Dawntrail, I was absolutely disappointed with it and [i]I decided to skip ALL of the damn cutscenes to just enjoy the combat side of it instead.[/i] Seriously, I have never seen the writing of this story become this utterly bad and rather a slog with it's pacing which it made me think it was either rushed or could have stayed in the oven longer. Hell, even if I gave some cutscenes a chance, I would literally fall asleep as they are boring as hell which it gave me a red flag by [b]DURING THE FIRST HALF OF IT BEFORE THE FIRST DUNGEON![/b]\n\nAnyway, as much I could have let it give another chance, I just did not care anymore and decided to forget it's story existed as if it remained to be poorly made from start to finish. What pisses me off more is that some of the characters that I knew of from previous expansions were never fleshed out which that brings me another thing...\n\n[h1]The Elephant in the Room, Wuk Lamat[/h1]\nI will be real with you, I did not like her by the time when she becomes the main character of the story and constantly be everywhere by being annoying, lack any real sort of character growth or development and becoming a babysitter. What's even worse is that when she couldn't even give me [b]THE LAST TRIAL[/b] was what made me absolutely despise her. The voice acting is another thing but, I just cannot stand her as a whole and that really says for something as many other people have pointed it out about it. \n\nGod, it makes me miss Lyse since Stormblood. She may be an honest to god moron but, I at least tolerate her to some degree.\n\n[h1]Okay, what about the combat?[/h1]\nFrankly, the combat is an improvement! The dungeons, trials and raids were amazing with more stuff involved and it's significant increase with it's difficulty than the previous expansions. It is a real welcoming change and I do hope they keep it that way here and out since I felt pretty much bored with doing previous combat duties from previous expansions for a long while.\n\nThis is pretty much my saving grace from this expansion and I have nothing else to say about other things than being just as good as I expect to be (especially the music).\n\n[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, Dawntrail is...not an good expansion due to it's story being poorly told, awful pacing and lack of execution. Some people are considering it as the worst expansion more than A New Realm Reborn (Base game) and Stormblood, I personally find very close to it which that's really unfortunate. The combat was still amazing, don't get me wrong, but I just cannot accept what Dawntrail delivered. I hope the post patches may save the last of it but, what at cost? The expense of getting rid of Luk Wamat and flesh out whatever the team had going for this story for better or worse. Maybe the new combat instance (like Bozja from Shadowbringers) in later patches would be my main enjoyment but, that remains to be seen.\n\nThis was not the vacation that I have hoped for and it felt like a scam in the end.

I did not even do this with Stormblood. And this is especially bad, because this expansion marks the start of the next 10 years. If this is the start, I feel worried.\nTo give a little insight before I tackle the story:\n\nThe areas are very big and varied. No 3x desert like Stormblood was. They are huge in size, a little to its downside. The battle content has not been this engaging since the big job rework in Shadowbringers.\n\nBut now the story. First off, my expectations were on the level of Heavensward to ARR. Nothing big or fancy. I was hoping DT would bring up narrative themes, characters or alliances that would outlive the expansion itself. A setup like ARR did, since EW resolved all our threats, Zodiark and Hydaelyn as well as the WoL agency. By the end of 7.0 nothing was built up that seems it will outlive the expansion ([spoiler] only we get a magic item that allows possible reflection travel [/spoiler]. ARR did that at the end of it and all other expansions had a post credit cutscene touching on the existing threats (Ascians, Garlemald, etc.). We as a character do not get a new calling, we remain an adventurer. (ARR saw in us at least a useful tool for slaying primals).\n\nNow the story of DT itself. It consists of 2 halfs that besides playing on the same continent do clash harshly in tone and theme. Since again we have to stories told in one expansion, both are rushed and underdeveloped. We bring up even previous resolved themes again with the final zone ([spoiler]The endless are basically the Ancients reloaded.[/spoiler]) Interesting themes are brought up here and there, but never really followed through. Any theme of grief is quickly brushed aside with something that I could only call as toxic positivity.\n\nThe pacing of the story is all over the place. The start is so slow, that I was thinking of skipping it, then things are happening all at once, then we have a whole area of filler quest and then things need to go fast again.\n\nThe characters feel hollow this expansion, because only Wuk takes center. Even when the Scions are the experts for the situation at present, she is there to take the spotlight. All the others are only there to shine light on her as a character. But by the end...I knew nothing more of her that was not apparent than in 6.55. This is just sad. \n\nAnd it all leads into a credits theme that Disney would use.\n\nFurthermore the voice acting and mixing is bad. It feels often wooden oder badly mixed at best.\n\nTo summerize:\nDT lacks care. Care for a cohesive narrative with its own deep theme that is not \"Friendship is magic\". Care for its characters that are not Wuk Lamat. Care for the voice acting. And care for the next ten years. But at least the battle content has been taken care of. \nI cannot in good conscience recommend this expansion. Only if you skip everything and focus only on the battle. \nMy wish for the future: Create an overarching narrative framework ASAP that outlasts DT, give all characters time in the MSQ and give the WoL a calling again (We are no longer a primal slayer and Hydaelyns chosen).", "timestamp_created": 1722548149, "timestamp_updated": 1722548149, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540698230266571045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171249433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104210137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "CURSE YOU WUK LAMAT!!!\n\nI HEREBY VOW!

Just moves on. \n* Another character meets his mother, that treats him like a pet and he treats her like annoying teenage girlfriend.\n* New father abandons his child, then tries to strangle him, then on death bed spouts some emo grade deranged reasoning that he did that because his father spurned him.\n\nNo mention or introduction of mothers in 1st or last case.

They completely missed the mark with Dawntrail. The new characters they introduced are sloppy and the story is even worse. Up to level 97 the story doesn\u2019t really get interesting and can be described as \u201cnot even being worthy of a side quest\u201d. If you could skip this DLC and watch a 15-minute story video, you would be able to cover everything this DLC has to offer in terms of the story. Furthermore, you are not the main character of this DLC. While this is not necessarily a bad thing. After slaying gods and going to the end of existence, you are treated as nothing more than a babysitter in this DLC. How they executed this was simply not good. The music is good, sometimes not fitting. New Areas are ok and some zones are breathtaking.\n\nThey should\u2019ve shortened the level 90 \u2013 96 quests to simply level 90 \u2013 93 quests and then continue on into the unknown and do your world building. That would\u2019ve really helped this DLC.\n\nThe promise of the golden city was so much, and instead we ended up, wherever the hell we ended up.\n\nThe worst (or better) part is, the side stories (e.g. side quests, but also the level 100 raid storyline) is much better than the MSQ, even the characters are better. And that's not really good for your MSQ if that is the case.\n\nAs the developers already said, this DLC is going to be an experiment, I really hope that they take all the feedback to heart and produce a new awesome DLC next. Or otherwise, I\u2019m afraid this DLC will be the start of the end of FFIXV.\n\nI really miss shadowbringers.\n\nNow for the long version.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s focus on what went well.\n\n[b]New areas/world (B): [/b]\nThe new areas are great. They are beautiful and each area is interesting. You can really be awed by some of the areas, and they come when you least expect it. But there are also areas that are underwhelming. Especially compared to the areas with the previous expansions. \nFurthermore, there are areas which are not used to its full potential, and you spend maybe 4 hours in them before completing everything.\n\nAlso, the way they mixed some cultures/continents together was really weird. One thing you\u2019re in south America, and suddenly you\u2019re in Texas, and then you are in the future.\n\n[b]Music (A):[/b]\nJust like all final fantasy XIV music, the music is great. But I wouldn\u2019t say it was the best music of all the expansions. There were a few areas where I thought: \u201cThis music isn\u2019t really fitting here\u201d.\n\n[b]Graphic update (A+):[/b]\nI never imagined that the graphics update was so needed. From the landscapes to the buildings, to the hair, everything has more detail. But especially the upgrade of the amours. The armours are extremely beautiful now with lots of details.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the bad things:\n\n[b]MSQ (E-):[/b]\nAs mentioned above, for an MMO which is story heavy, the MSQ has to be good. You are promised a new adventure, and for 80% of the MSQ you are merely babysitting Wuk Lamat. The side characters are not memorable as I forgotten some of them already when they came back a few hours later. \n\nWhat is worse, is how they have written Wuk Lamat. As you are not the main character of this DLC (which is not inherently a bad thing), you should have strong companions who could fill that gap. The companion who fills that gap (Wuk Lamat) is nothing more than a baby who is leeching of you and has no character progression of her own throughout the whole DLC. She starts as an irritating baby, and she ends as an irritating baby who eats up screen time. Some of the major side characters have much better character progression and you really see them grow. And to not even talk about how rushed some of the stories where for the main companions, such as Krile and Erenville. \n\nAlso, nothing really remarkable happens until at the very end. Where every previous expension has had it\u2019s memorable moments (like ultimate thule, Amaurot, labyrinthos, Heavensward, etc.). \n\nI can go on about the details, but lastly is the lack of screen time of your most important companions, the scion\u2019s. All the scion\u2019s you love and \u2018grew\u2019 up with have barely any screen time. Instead you are being forced to watch a irritating baby.\n\n[b]Pacing (F-):[/b]\nYou thought the filler in the middle of Endwalker was bad? Nearly half of the MSQ DLC is a filler. To the point where it became really, really, boring. It also went something like this:\n[i]Speak to X\n- Cut scene \u2013[/i]\nWalk 50 meters.\n[i]Speak to Y\n- Cut scene \u2013[/i]\nTurn your character around\n[i]Speak to X again\n- Cut scene \u2013[/i]\n\nWhen a journal is saying 'Speak to X again' multiple times. You're doing something wrong.\n\nAnd this continued on for a majority of the quests. A lot of unnecessary time is waster just having a loading screen of 3 seconds at the end and beginning of every cut scene. \n\nFurthermore, every time you are hoping of \u201cYea, we are going on that train!\u201d or \u201cwe are finally going to do that!\u201d, only to get disappointed by more fetch and talk quests. Never have I noticed that I wasted so much time.", "timestamp_created": 1722454698, "timestamp_updated": 1722463896, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509197354316711426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171174703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024435911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The warrior of light, the savior of worlds, suddenly takes a back seat to a dumb cat who cries when her tacos are knocked down.", "timestamp_created": 1722445201, "timestamp_updated": 1722445201, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56915283203125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171159587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021697729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "[h2]Dawntrail is a massive step down from Endwalker.[/h2]\n\n[h3]MSQ[/h3]\nThe MSQ is filled with boring, unnecessary and badly written dialogue and cutscenes.\n\nFurthermore, this is the Story of Wuk Lamat, your character this time around only plays a side-role. Wuk Lamat is not really a likeable or interesting character. She reminds me of Lyse from Stormblood. \n\nOverall the MSQ feels like a Sidequest with voiced cutscenes.\nI do hope they return to a story written for your character or at least an interesting one like Zero from the Post-Endwalker patches. \n\n(And please let Natsuko Ishikawa write the story again)\n\n// I wanna point out that i don't dislike the voice for Wuk Lamat at all. I think the voice fits her. \nI have heard that there is a vast difference in quality between the Japanese and English, but i cannot confirm this, since i don't speak Japanese. \n\n[h3]Zones[/h3]\nThe first 2 1/2 Zones are very similar with some questionable design decisions that make traversal without flying rather bothersome. Later on the Zones get more interesting but are rather empty. Especially in the 2nd Main HUB you will most likely only find players in one corner while the rest of it is just empty - could have placed more NPCs to make it more lively. \n\n[h3]Music[/h3]\nSame with the Music. At the start very average and partly even obnoxious. It gets better later but nothing that comes close to previous Expansions. \n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\n[strike] I have not yet seen every single dungeon/trial/raid yet. [/strike]\nWhat i've seen so far hasn't impressed me either. Again... Average. \n\n// I have since finally managed to do the current dungeons, trials and raids.\nThe last MSQ dungeon was pretty nice i have to say and the final Trial as well up the point where they [spoiler] literally interrupted the fight for a cutscene where Wuk Lamat tries to... talk to the boss to make peace. Talk about anti-climactic. [/spoiler] \nReally ruined the fight for me.\n\nThe raids are pretty decent. Boss designs are pretty nice, especially the 4th one.\nLocation and Story are okay so far. Not as heavy as previous raids but okay. \n\nThe new Jobs are nice, i guess. It's a matter of taste. \n\nPersonally i don't enjoy Pictomancer too much - it gets very repetitive. \nFeels like a dumbed down version of BLM. \n\nViper is fun, although has some questionable CD phases where you literally cant press a button for 1-2 seconds, which kinda ruins the flow. Apart from your super-saiyan mode the VFX for Viper look a bit hollow as well. \n\nThis is my current opinion of Dawntrail. \nThere are plenty of other reviews that are better at pointing out the flaws of this Expansions - so have a read. \nLuckily, there are a lot of other things, unrelated to the Expansion that remain interesting.\n\nFFXIV still has one of the best communities that i enjoy to engage with. \nAnd a lot of Content unrelated to the MSQ, that i like to do.", "timestamp_created": 1722428256, "timestamp_updated": 1722625693, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528791725635528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171147542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018252107", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 177342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 734, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not here to argue, i grew up playing incredible histories from square enix and this game was one of the best if not the best storytelling in a game i have ever played and i must be honest, when i played the main history for dawntrail i was... angry, wich is an step further than sad because of the poor writing and general plot of the expansion, this is horrible, there is no new cool character, and no character had significant development, i cant believe the team from previous dlcs read this and said \"this will be a good expansion\".\n\nThe rest of the expansion is incredible, trials, dungeons, instances in general and job aditions were on point but i cant recommend it considering MSQ is mandatory and how they butchered it. 5/10, skip and play the content if you want.", "timestamp_created": 1722411508, "timestamp_updated": 1722411508, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520072221755981445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "171128235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056837986", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "This entire expansion is a joke, every single problem is solved using the infamous power of friendship and every adversity that happens could be avoided if the scions decided to do ANYTHING besides staring at the bad guy while they're doing their bad guy speech.

Oh you want to have your only moment of you being cool nope Wuk Lamat shows up at the end and gives you her awesome aura as a literal buff to steal the spotlight from you the main character. Look this is an MMO I come here to play a fantasy game and since the beginning of the game Iv'e been set up as the hero the one who can defy the odds and if the story isn't having my character actually being important in some way then that is a problem. In the Raid series its about your character so Suprise, Suprise its actually good you feel important. \n\nHer character is on screen so much she does not allow any of the much more interesting characters, have any character development, she drowns them in her awesome divine aura as the game puts it in the final fight. She is like a Primal that is tempering everyone around her wherever she goes in the story to loving her unconditionally.\n\nNow that the rant is over the only really good things i'll say are as long as you skip all Wuk Lamat dialogue you have a midcore story that you can probably say is on par with ARR or even below. 5/10 if we ignore Wuk Lamat with her i'd drop it to a 3/10 for story content being one of the worst MSQ they have done hands down the foundation is their with the areas characters but the execution was so poorly done. The new writers need to either be swapped out and let someone else have a go or have the old writers help them out a bunch or both needs to be done.\n\nGameplay and the Dungeons/Trials/Raids are still fantastic. 10/10 this is good cause now we can hope the developers can make adjustments for the post content patches to have little to no Wuk Lamat and focus on other characters who got completely overshadowed.\n\nIn the end this story was supposed to be a Vacation for the Warrior of Light what I got was needing a Vacation from Wuk Lamat.

For context, this was the first expansion of the game I would be able to play at day 1 since I started playing the game around the time of 6.2's(?) release. Overpower was still a cone shape when I started.\n\nI'll try to keep things relatively spoiler free and brief.\n\nTl;Dr: Dawntrail is mid at best and confusing at worst. The antagonists are underdeveloped, and Wuk Lamat is a hit or miss on if you like her (especially given that the writers WILL try and make you hate her with how they handle her). The Scions have no reason to be in this expansion, but hey, we had to have somebody to put on the poster! However, the dungeon and overall environmental design are very good, and the new graphical update is great as well. New jobs are also really fun too!\n\nTo be fair, here are some of the things I think were good about this expansion. I think the graphical update was long overdue and it is very nice seeing the updated textures/models/and lighting with all the new areas. I think the environment design is also some of its best, as most the areas don't feel big for the sake of big like with some of the areas in past expansions. Dungeon and trial design is also a net positive as most of the fights are engaging and occasionally tricky, and the new jobs are also fun to play around with! I for one love Pictomancer a lot... and it is here that my praises end.\n\nFor the sake of brevity I am going to gloss over that the lighting in certain areas of the game has yet to be retooled/adjusted which makes some scenes from older areas/MSQ look a little off. That's just the nature of the beast, and I believe the devs plan to make those adjustments in future patches, so I'm not going to harp on it too much.\n\nNow for... everything else. I think overall this MSQ is the weakest out of every past expansion and ARR. It is mediocre at its best moments and terribly confusing/unbearable at its worst. The first half of the MSQ mostly suffers the crime of being too slow/boring. I enjoyed it to an extent, but once I realized the pattern was basically \"Talk to the locals. Learn their issues. Learn their culture. Solve the issues,\" about 6 times in a row... it became a bit of a slog. While there is some mild conflict between the succession groups in the early game, it's not enough to be truly engaging. There's a few points where it feels like the writers intentionally avoided having conflict between certain characters just to pick the easy route. I can see why most people would find it boring.\n\nThe second half of the MSQ just... uhm, well, it's a mess. There's so many new concepts and characters that get thrown in over half-way through the story and it does not do anybody any favors. A lot of the new concepts introduced, in my opinion, feel disjointed from what we see in the first half of the expansion. It's like learning Spanish before suddenly being given a test in Japanese. It definitely doesn't meld as seamlessly as it should've. The main antagonists' goals, while conceptually interesting to a degree, do not get any true development making both of their arcs ultimately bland. The emotional arcs the writers try to set-up also fail spectacularly for both of these characters because they have nothing holding their characters up. They receive no greater development because most of the screen time has either been eaten up by people we ultimately never see again or is only used to show how mysterious said antagonist is. The allure of mystery is only going to take you so far.\n\nSpeaking of characters, Wuk Lamat. I don't hate Wuk Lamat, but boy, it feels like the writers try really hard to make her as annoying as possible. I don't blame people for hating her. I think what mostly hurts her character is the writing decisions made surrounding her. A light spoiler, if you will: She is with you practically the entire MSQ. The game teases the player by acting like the second half will be you going on a solo adventure. You never get this. You never get your \"Hero\" moment. There is only Wuk Lamat now.\n\nMemes aside, this feels like the natural end result for this kind of character. The devs spent years conditioning the player base by giving them a good, player-oriented experience. It makes the player feel special, feel like a hero. The experience here feels deeply unsatisfying. You truly never get a moment where the focus is on you, the Warrior of Light. Except, I lied a little bit. There is one moment during the final trial... and it gets ripped right out of your hands at the very end. It sucks. While I don't mind the first half of the game focusing on Wuk Lamat, I definitely think the expansion would've positively benefited from her exclusion in the second half.\n\nOn that note, the Scions. They should not have been included at all. the majority of them serve little significant purpose and could be completely cut out and replaced with other characters. Occam's razor, if you will. It feels like the devs thought players would POG at their faves being on screen for 5 seconds, but it made me more angry than anything. If you're going to have a beloved character there, then have them DO SOMETHING. It just felt hollow. I feel bad for Krile, considering the lead-up to Dawntrail marked her as a central character. She was done dirty. Her development felt artificial, especially regarding a certain plot point. It's wild to me that Eureka did more for her character than this entire expansion. I have nothing to say in regards to Erenville or the twins. Erenville was fine, I was never particularly interested in his character, but I think he had the most emotional arc out of everyone here. The twins were chill, though it felt like they were mostly there just to fill out the party sadly.\n\nI've ruminated on a lot of this for the past few weeks, but I do apologize if it reads as messy. I wanted to try and be fair, but I haven't felt this strongly about a game in a long while. I have not felt the drive to touch any of the Post-MSQ content for this expansion, so I cannot vouch for any opinions on that. I gave this expansion a fair shot. I went in with the mindset of wanting to like it, but came out kind of hating it story-wise.

The second half feels very much shoe-horned in and causes the pacing to be jarring while introducing two un-relatable antagonists who have hardly much motivation at all. It ends on a lot of open questions and lore logs feel inconsistent with pre-established lore.\n\nDungeons are interesting but become repetitive quickly. Most bosses only perform a handful of mechanics and some only have 2 possible attacks. Their music and atmosphere is good however the combat and boss encounters felt lackluster. Due to current time of writing dungeons are also not great for experience as you're able to spam an Endwalker 24-man raid with the Azeyma's Earring and level far faster than any dungeon can until 97.\n\nCombat has largely been oversimplified but in a poor way. Most skills are now locked to only be used when you use a major buff skill and this tends to also clip into you cooldowns. Some skills are tied to others with almost no sense (Resonant arrow can only be used after barrage and can't be affected by barrage. Barrage doesn't even work on aoe skills. For example.)\nIt feels largely dull and unrewarding to master you class or jarring to people who played a class for years only for it to be largely overhauled out of nowhere.\n\nThe new classes aren't as fantastic as some of the others. Pictomancer does offer a fresh new take on casters though it can be goofy and cartoony if you're someone who desires a more serious tone. It does have an issue with aggro being generated rather quickly and the motif skills take 3 seconds and do nothing more than \"load a bullet\" for other skills.\nViper, while flashy feels very largely unfinished. The class consists of maintaining a debuff and about 4 buttons while pushing another one in between. It offers nothing but damage and has absolutely no utility. At times it feels this class is also under-performing on DPS.\n\nDawntrail as a whole feels vastly uninspired and unfinished while making nonsensical changes to classes. It feels they gave up on narrative and simply wanted to push content out rather than having quality content.

Usually I'm somewhat on the same page with my character, like, not exactly agree with what's shown on screen but can understand it or can allow it...I've never felt more at odds with my avatar in the game than in this expansion.\n\nSure, previous ones also had their fair share of issues here and there but they were never this numerous and this blatant.\n\nI had set my expectations low...I was shocked to see that I should've set them much much lower.\n\nThe writing, awful VA performances, especially Wuk's, and questionable use of music at times (the train building montage was weird and the use of Smile was even weirder), make this expansion feel more of a chore to finish as soon as possible to get to the good parts rather than the kind of journey it can only dream to be.\n\nThankfully there are good parts...namely, gameplay and music (often used nicely and in and of itself still stellar), so my hope is that the writers for the MSQ are either removed from their positions or compile all the criticisms and learn from them and, if there was someone that dictated certain choices be made, I hope they are fired or never allowed to make choices again.\n\nThe writing and, with it, the pacing are the main issues this expansion has. It really feels like two different groups of writers handled the two arcs of this expansion and it kinda shows in the way that certain characters seem to seemingly change for no reason.\n\nI've also seen many defend this or that decision but, most of the time, it's either \"one thing was said that could be interpreted to mean this\" or \"this could've happened because stuff could've happened off screen\" like, just stop. You are making excuses for horrible writing. It feels like amateurs wrote this and yes, if Square hired me, I feel confident I'd have been able to handle this storyline better than whoever's behind this.\n\nThe players were not allowed a single-moment to rest...except Shaaloani but even that was badly written and short-lived as we were cast back into, in order, a world-ending scenario shortly followed by a multi-world ending scenario.\n\nWe were promised adventure and a vacation...we got none of that. We got something akin to the Ascians but handled in such a naive and unsubtle way that made me start hating how every Scion's personality was nuked, how Erenville and Krile's personal arcs that could've been so so much better got butchered and how an interesting concept also got ruined because it was handled by people that clearly were unprepared to deal with these concepts and couldn't help themselves from shoehorning Wuk Lamat in almost any single interactions.\n\nUsers have compiled the data of all the interactions in the expansion's MSQ, they made memes on it and discussions about it.\n\nSo, to all the defenders of this expansion, I don't want to take away the love you may have for it BUT I hope you can all admit that this expansion is divisive in a way that ShB and EW never were despite them handling themes way more complex.\n\nTo those screeching transphobia at whoever points out that Wuk's EN VA's performance is among the worsts of the bunch, shut up, you have a bias and your fervor doesn't do anyone good. It's perfectly fine to point out what was a major weak point that was only exacerbated from the fact that it was for such a predominant character in this expansion.\n\nAgain, you do have a bias because you can't listen to how she speaks in the last trial and come here and say that it's perfectly fine...it's not. You may think so and that's good but it's just not.\n\nI still kinda like Wuk's character and I hope she gets handled much much better in future expansions but I came so close to wanting to choke her to death just to make her shut up by the time I got my alpaca.\n\nThat's about it.

Battle team showed up in spades\n\n-Pictomancer, feels fresh and is a blast.\n\n-Graphics update, say no more\n\n-Boss music and overall score, it\u2019s good overall\n\n-Environments and atmosphere, some of the zones are rather gorgeous.\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\n-Trope shonen manga story character arc. I\u2019m sorry we deserve better storytelling than this coming from the previous four expansions. It\u2019s just childish given the layers of stories and narratives XIV has excelled in telling us over the years. On top it's not even well told.\n\n-Zero screen time for any Scions. Instead rather, you\u2019re force fed the most one dimensional character CBU3 has ever created who has one point she repeats ad nauseam onto you (and it\u2019s literally just understanding others and the power of friendship). Oddly Wuk Lamat is sort of enjoyable at the beginning, the game just forces her and that message to you to so much you simply want nothing to do with her-and you haven't even gotten to the second trial yet. Expect to cringe a lot. She makes Lyse look like Kate Blanchett.\n\n-Pacing has just gotten progressively worse. Not the first time it's been a negative in other patches. But the excessive length of cutscenes, fetch quests, lack of interactions is just bizarre. So many moments in the story with missed opportunities.  Like when we're on \"that\" train and i was like YES we're going to man the guns millenium falcon style. No dice. One example, but things like that. Never have I noticed myself bored watching my WoL's journey till now.\n\n-Nothing really all that memorable or remarkable happens after it's all said and done. Remember how each previous expansion has some truly unique moments? The Ultima Thule climb, Thancred Metal Gear Solid, that time you found yourself in someone else\u2019s body, Amaurot reveal, Tsukiyomi, All of Heavensward etc etc. This one I got to watch Estinien have fun while I didn\u2019t, do a top chef cookoff (great idea could have been better), and a chance to finally see Krile\u2019s backstory (Spoiler: nope, that one was rushed and cut short in favor of our irritating protagonist's screen time).\n\n-Side characters are completely forgettable. That one Pelu pelu you're supposed to know but they all look and sound the same. That one Hrothgar in the first zone who was quirky, but then every other one since (spoiler, there's like one in every zone dressed the same) all had the same dialogue and responses as well. I took my sweet time through MSQ and I still don\u2019t recall a single name. \n\n-Later zones look like stereotype environments and just feel uninspired. Solution 9 looks like something Midjourney would output if you typed in futuristic synthwave cyberpunk. I normally love that aesthetic, but it's so generic and doesn't feel unique to what that \"world\" would have become over time. Shaloanni \"the wild west\" is the most worthless, uninspiring zone with poorly written and voice acted stereotyped \u201ctexas american\u201d actors. Imagine a western with zero tension. Silver lining is you finally get away from Wuk Lamat for a short time.\n\n-Barely any Krile and Erenville time, the two most people you\u2019d thought the expansion would have to chill and explore with. Especially Krile, she actually has a really interesting wrinkle in her backstory. Instead you only get to touch upon it lightly and at the end. Even in her expansion she takes the back back seat.\n\n-This part will be subjective, but we have to talk music. It is decent overall, it is just not Soken\u2019s best. Usually there\u2019s a strong, memorable theme with leif motifs used throughout and some extended themes. This one doesn't really have any main theme, just a few  smaller subsets with some leif motif light versions used throughout. The problem is all of them together they feel disconnected and all over the place. While that is not entirely a bad thing, the bigger problem is the tonality of the chosen music feeling completely off base in context of the story. The jazz and southern swing together in the city, the 'muzak' of Shaolanni.'  And the big elephant everyone points to... Smile, which has to be one of the worst songs i\u2019ve ever heard from the FFXIV music team, let along FF as a whole. When it plays each time within the story, it\u2019s confusing and jarring in relation to the moment.  Then you have this latin inspired fight music that is lighthearted and whimsical which works (initially) for an upbeat adventure story that this was advertised as. But juxtapose that later on in zones of the game that are grim sadness of it all...  it takes that emotion and makes it all feel like a complete joke when you do . Nevermind also that the vocals in just about every vocal track are rather poor. There are some gems, but just don't expect this one to feel S tier like the previous expansions. It's good in parts, but not the soundtrack I\u2019d enjoy end to end like the others. Soken is mortal afteral.\n\n-Even more cultural misappropriation, and it's borderline immersion breaking. If Radz-at-Han was India, let\u2019s now choose South America this time, but also fuse Mexican and southern US as well. I don\u2019t know but this is becoming a bit less like true fantasy inspiration and now becoming part of their formula. Not sure how I feel about this. I'd like a bit less reality in my fantasy. For example, I don't mind the idea of tacos in this world, but devoting cutscenes to the unique culinary methods of Cochinita Pibil in how it's cooked underground using achiote  the same way the Mayans have done it for generations in the Yucatan does what for your game? Showing you can't come up with something unique to your own game world? \n\nThe Ugly\n\n-Shoddy audio and poorly mixed voice acting. The levels and recording quality is just flat out inconsistent here, really noticeable in Shalaonni. There are some YouTube videos on this. But as someone who is involved in production and  mixing at record sessions, this seems very off for team Yoshi-P. Have a feeling this was outsourced with not much oversight.\n\n-You the WoL are a fly on the wall until the last fight (but not really). You take the backseat the entire story. Truthfully this shouldn't be a bad thing, I don\u2019t mind letting things play out with others for a while. But there's gotta be some balance. Doing this for an expansion worth of long noninteractive content is boring. And you'll notice a great many things happen, another  whole world ending journey could have been solved multiple repeated times had the WoL simply jumped in when they should have at that moment. One and done. While it wouldn't have made a good story, it would have actually made more sense for them to do so. The trick is they needed to make it where I couldn't have, again... storytelling 101.\n\n-Main villain is kind of one note, and hard to get their motive other than just being a warmonger. They try to make a relatable backstory, but it lands like an air ball from a 3 point jump shot. Felt nothing for them, before and after it's over.\n\n-Excessive use of flashbacks. Never have I seen this in any expansion where they forced the point that happened minutes ago with a flashback to MAKE SURE YOU GOT THE POINT. Treats the audience like we\u2019re children.\n\n-Tuliyollal kind of lacks the awe and wonder of every previous expansion city. Really not that interesting compared to Sharlayan, Crystarium and Kugane.\n\n-Another world ending affair after they said they would likely not rely on that every expansion\u2026we\u2019re now in Marvel Multiverse sort of territory now that the gates are open (pun intended) and there\u2019s no going back.\n\nTLDR: A new chapter in a new journey doesn't mean you have to forgo storytelling basics to force a childish message, a character, a tone or a story formula for their 3 dungeons 1 trial formula. On paper by concept, the story framework was a decent one to tell. Just poorly executed and contrived.

The story seems off, especially given that the younger generation is portrayed as eager for conflict. Zoraal Ja\u2019s comment about peace lasting too long doesn\u2019t match the global scale of the Final Days, which were worse than war. Overall, the narrative feels disjointed.\n\nWuk Lamat\u2019s character writing is particularly problematic. I liked her in Endwalker, but her portrayal in Dawntrail is poorly handled. It feels like the game is forcing players to like her, and the shift in her character is jarring and disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, many quests revolve around Wuk Lamat, even when it would make more sense to involve characters like Erenville, Krile, or Alphinaud. The objectives often stem from their ideas rather than Wuk Lamat\u2019s, making the focus on her feel misplaced. The story should balance attention among all characters, including Krile and Erenville, who were shown to have significant roles in Endwalker.\n\nWhile I\u2019m unhappy with the current state of the expansion and might consider asking for a refund, I understand the need for it to progress the storyline.

Even setting aside all the Wuk Lemat memes. The character is boring, a Mary Sue, and the WHITE VA tries to do an accent of unknown origin... Along with other things. Also I found out that the character spoke 7000 WORDS... about 3-4 thousand more than the next character. The graphical update was hyped up unless you really stare at certain things, but you really can't tell. Honestly, the only thing I really noticed was the lighting which really only peaks on older content that you try and compare. The new 2 dyed gear seems underwhelming and most gear pieces do not have it. The story was really upsetting. I don't remember much from ARR but I recall there was more interesting elements from the original story 10 YEARS AGO. Also I glaze/forget the mundane parts of the story and really pay attention to the foreshadowing elements/deep lore and there were moments that seemed promising but almost all eventually led to dead ends. We didn't get left with much at the end of the story. The music choice seemed strong at some points and weak at others. But they took the Disney approach by adding a song you would imagine to have a dance choreography tied in with it. The areas in the world were hyped up to be massive, and they ARE MASSIVE. Even though they are massive they seem so lifeless with less points of interest and just big murals more than an interesting world zone. If they just made every area smaller and added more interesting things to see and interact with it would be a massive improvement. Combat segments through the story is far in between and they have you do more boring fetch quests, go from point to another and speak to so and so, and the dreaded stealth quests. Also I don't have a problem with re-used assets it adds some nice color options to old gear, but it is getting really tiring. Not to mention rehashed mobs/monsters. There is a lot more to hash on but that is more for a youtube long form video.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Yoshi-P and his team. They are one of the last few bastions in big company game developers. I am just sorely confused on their decisions and I don't know what limitations SE and Tencent are placing on them. Also I don't know much about the story writing team, but the main story writer that has done the last 10 years of story wasn't actively partaking in this expansion. I don't know how many veteran members of any team are still there. 10 years is a long time and they just finished with a masterpiece. I can't imagine how many people are willing to do another 10 years. Maybe they are training the next generation of developers? They have so much time but deceptively not much funding. What is taking up a lot of their time? What is being scrapped? There is a lot of past content they just skipped over or took a shortcut on. There is many thoughts and its really tiring and I don't have the mental capacity to put it in a steam review. It just seems like they are lost, or maybe they are cooking. If only we can talk to these developers face to face to understand their dilemma. Other than that the fights and combat in this expansion is really good. The new themes are refreshing but could be fleshed out more. Its a whole new feeling but has me worried.

I hate the monetization.\n\nFirst of all: We have to pay for the base game and latest expansion, which is understandable. After that we have the subscription fee we have to pay every month to get to play, its understandable because they need money to develop more content and keep the servers up.\n\nBut then... they hold quality of life features behind paywalls. (Like extra bank space and ability to put retainers on ventures when you are offline with your phone (these are not one time purchase btw. you have to pay each month)).  \n\nAnd stuff like mounts that represent in-game bosses and cool outfits which they clearly put lot of development time into are bought with real money instead of making them available in the game. Players are talking about the lack of rewards from endgame content meanwhile Square is putting the cool looking outfits and mounts to the store because they want more money even tho the game itself is selling very well?\n\nI hate that my favorite game is owned by a greedy corporation. It's clear these decisions are not even made by the development team, its the shareholders who want the game to print more money.\n\nSo, in the end its a really good game. These complaints are not the end of the world. I wouldn't have wasted years of my life playing a bad game.

Shadowbringer's expansion and Endwalker were really good and I was expecting that this expansion was going to be low budget with the graphics upgrade, but this is really really bad... At one point, I even started skipping MSQ story because it was sooo boring. Wuk Lamat is an incredibly boring character and her voice actress feels like she is reading a line without any emotions or knowledge of the story. Even the future of the story doesn't really hypes me up for more.... Bakool Ja Ja, though, is a very polished character and his voice actor is amazing! good job on this one. but overall, this expansion is not worth it. the graphics update is barely noticeable. it does shine in some areas and dungeon but nothing really amazing. This game is getting old and feels like they are milking it. Endwalker was the ending of this MMO and they should have worked on a newer and more polished MMO instead. I'd love FF17 or FF18 to be a new revamped MMO with all the knowledge they gained from this game. At this point, even the bad guys are acknowledging that we are litterally a killer of gods and they would not win fighting us, what's the point even. this game is almost 15 years old right now. I mean, just like the story told us, everything has an end and Endwalker would have been a good ending point for this game. Continuing this MMO was not a good option. I would have liked some new raids and very small stories related to the whole ARR-EW instead of starting a new journey that is going to lead nowhere. I do love this game a lot, I met some of my best friends in this game and even got to see them in real life and I cherish this game for it. But this game needs an end for real, even tho this would break my heart. It's for the better of the FF14 team and us the players. You had such an amazing experience through and through and you go mess it all up with a bad story and barely noticeable graphic upgrade. Now, the memories we will have of this game is the bad quality we had with Dawntrail... it's a shame. I really hope they change their mind and doesn't continue this horrible story that they are building. get us a REAL fresh new story with a NEW engine. A new MMO even more polishing than what FF14 gave us. I know they can do it and I 100% believe they would deliver.\n\nI'm posting this bad review with all the love I have for this game and because I care a lot about it. I want the better for us and for the FF14 team. Thank you for all the years of good content.

Instead, it appears that the entire main development team went on a vacation themselves and overlooked this issue. \n\n[b]The Scions are only here because they needed NPCs to fill for Duty Support.[/b]\n\nThat aside, I think the gameplay, music, graphics, zones, dungeons, and raids are superb and on par with what they have been developing since previous expansions. The difficulty is great and some of the new mechanics are a welcome approach to an already stale formula that I believe will not hold to the next expansion, but as for now, it is still accepted.\n\nIn short. I knew this expansion would be a \"filler\" story between the major arcs. But still got disappointed. It's only because I hold this game in such high regard that I want it to improve in every aspect.

But sadly after I went through everything that is available so far, I can only recommend it if you really don't care about the story and just want to fight stuff, because the fights (design wise and the new mechanics that they are trying) are amazing (EX1 has my favorite tankbuster of all time), and I absolutely loved the area design. \nThe soundtrack is decent too, though I don't think the Tuliollal music (day&night) fits a city that gives me Aztec/Maya vibes, but you hear some smooth jazz as if you just entered New Orleans.\nSo what went wrong? Was SE too short staffed cause they were busy with the graphical update (Which in some cases they did really poorly, Xaella scales looked as if someone sneezed on the design blueprint and didn't noticed it, but that's at least fixed now, I will still hold them accountable for poor QA, same as with the benchmarks)?  Spread too thin because of FF16 development? FF14 is still your main moneymaker, was SE just fine of winging it and just putting something together cause it will sell anyways, bold move if that's the case to not put in 100% or more for something that literally keeps the company afloat. How characters were written, how the story unfolds, not just the msq, but the classquests as well.... quality wise you find a better level of writing in an introductory creative writing class in college, maybe even lower. I have 15k hours in FF14, completed almost everything the game has, even reading all the sidequests, but this expansion made it that I started skipping things cause they were so painful to read or hear in some cases (example jobquests, if we compare them to what joy Shb and EW delivered instead). \nIf I wasn't invested as I am in FF14, I 100% would have refunded it after the first few hours, that's how bad the experience of the first few hours doing the new MSQ was, but we always hope things get better (talking to others how they liked it and what they expect for the future), well the hope for that and that they will do a 180 and deliver us a quality story that SE is known for, hoping for better times won't last long before players start to leave. And no the current difficulty is not too hard, learn to observe mechanics and you will figure it out after a few pulls.\n\nOverall a TLDR statement I would make is:\nFinal Fantasy 14, ARR - Endwalker has been our Mass Effect, a classic, loved by many by how good it was for its time, and still is.\nDawntrail on the other hand, Mass Effect Andromeda, not just from the quality of the whole expansion (again, if you just are interested in combat, it's great) but also how patterns crystallised out while doing the MSQ, it had so much repetition (Example last area  [spoiler]You have the pattern of meeting and help 2 people to \"get to know them better before you shut down the terminal, you do this 4 times\"[/spoiler]) so it also resembles the one dimensional visiting a planet and doing the same thing on each and every one of them.\n\nAs it is right now, the only reason I still even play is because of the people I know and hold dear to me that I met, be it friends or fc, but the motivation to log in just to play if I wasn't asked by them isn't there currently, and I rather play anything else and possibly enjoy my time there.", "timestamp_created": 1721946585, "timestamp_updated": 1721946585, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492065370082855225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170727216", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976795870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "An objectively troubled expansion for an otherwise brilliant game series.

Art direction? Especially the musical direction? It's stellar, and consistently fantastic. It's such a shame that the crazily talented people who worked in these departments had all that squandered by what feels like a bunch of interns. In particular, that some tunes remind me of Grim Fandango of all things is a huge highlight. \n\nThis story, and the voice acting for it, are embarrassingly bad and bafflingly amateur for a company with a market cap in the billions. I want to join in the chorus to help shake awake a clearly complacent team. It is so abundantly obvious that there was barely any communication between the two voice-acting studios, to the point where a two-headed character has two completely different levels of compression for each head. Sure, if you don't hear these kind of things, you might not notice - but it's nails on chalkboards for me every single time we hop between the wildly different levels of recording quality. The original studio continues to deliver fantastic work and great performances, and then you have some dude phoning in this flat drawl that gets crunched down to be half as dynamic as the person who spoke five seconds before him. \n\nThe newer studio, which I guess is US-based, feels like it's five friends who can do cartoonishly bad hispanic accents, and you'll hear the same 4 voices for multiple side and central characters. If this was an indie title, I mean, whatever - but it isn't, and it really doesn't help the worldbuilding when you hear the exact same accent, with the exact same strained and forced ticks, being used for 3 separate characters in the same 10-minute cutscene, after which you walk a solid 5 feet and get treated to another one. \n\nAnd while you might be tricked into thinking that Latin America has a rich and storied history with a ton of material that you could source into your sprawling, massive fantasy world which has up until this point eagerly absorbed plenty of other cultures, it apparently boils down to tacos, alpacas, mezcal, two or three stupid accents, and lamely attempting to repeat things that previous expansions already did, and already did better. \n\nAnd to touch on the favorite punching bag: Wuk Lamat's voice actor drops the weird, strained accent every third quest and has absolutely zero range.

The writing can be describe as essentially a expansion long Beast Tribe Quest.\n\nDawntrail also has the misfortune of being forever interlinked with Wuk Lamat as a character. The writers were bold enough to explicitly state that Wuk Lamat inspires the player character during a story critical moment, while also having her relying on the player character for help the entire expansion.

The story writing for this expansion was absolutely abysmal. It's as if the people writing the MSQ only had a surface-level summary of the game and characters involved, and the scions are tagging along for the sole reason of having bodies for the duty support system. \n\nProbably my biggest gripe is how nobody in Tural seems to have been affected by, or even acknowledge the existence and impact of, the huge global catasrophes in both the recent and distant past. The 'history' of Tural is basically just the last ~80 years with Daddy Ja Ja, and giants did something thousands of years ago but have been sitting on their butts since then. The Final Days? Never heard of her. The previous 7 umbral calamaties? Who?\n\nMany people compare Wuk Lamat to Lyse, however I'd say she's more like ARR-patches Alphinaud.

Lots of fetching/trivial quests in the first half of the story. These quests don't contribute much to story building and are mostly just a waste of time. I was really hyped at the start, but when I reached lvl 93 I was already so bored due to all the walking and fetching. Really reminds me of ARR, and I thought XIV moved away from this formula of story progression a long time ago.\n\n2. Too many unnecessary cutscenes. I won\u2019t mind if the cutscenes are actually important for storytelling, but half the time it\u2019s not. It was cutscene - walk somewhere else to talk to another character about random stuff - cutscene, rinse and repeat. Before Dawntrail, whenever there\u2019s a cutscene, I know they\u2019re gonna say something important. Now I just feel like \u201coh crap, not another cutscene\u201d. \n\n3. Characters are very flat and often not explained well. I was interested in many new characters ([spoiler]Zoraal Ja, Cahciua, Krile\u2019s parents, Ketenramm [/spoiler]) and thought the story would at least give more information/character development for them as it progresses, but they ended up either having little screen time or were only used as a tool for story progression. I remember crying multiple times towards the end of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but this time I barely felt any emotions while completing MSQ in the last map. The story never gave me enough information to make me feel connected enough to the characters involved. Even Wuk Lamat felt like a story progression tool in the last bit of MSQ.

[/spoiler] Huge step down from the earlier expansions, really disappointing. \n\n4. Some bad logic that spoils the mood. \n[spoiler]1. Wuk Lamat overusing \"power of friendship\" to tip the power scale. The final fight where she called to Sphene and the boss instantly revived Sphene\u2019s data was such BS. I thought it can\u2019t get any worse but then it proceeds to force me watch these two characters have a cringe ass conversation while dumbing down the difficulty of the whole fight in phase 2??? Totally killed the hype. [/spoiler] \n[spoiler]2. Mysterious looking item fell out of Zoraal Ja after he died, the team just stood there and waited for Sphene to do a long speech and take the key. [/spoiler] \n[spoiler]3. Wuk Lamat: My childhood friend\u2019s mom died. Instead of comforting him I am more curious about how we are gonna chase Sphene. [/spoiler] \n[spoiler]4. Krile finally sees her parents. Was supposed to be emotional but for some reason they chose to make it a gag scene. Also, how does Graha eating a huge ice cream make it less awkward for Krile???

And of course the graphics update - even though it's not technically part of Dawntrail - is *chef's kiss*.\n\nAs for the bad....\nThe story is split up into two parts and in my opinion it suffers for it.\nThe first half felt boring and repetitive. It's not exactly the exciting \"contest\" I thought it would be - filled with mystery and adventure - but rather half an MSQ worth of fetch quests. The second half was more interesting and had more promise, but still failed to deliver. Many payoffs and climaxes fell flat for me due it being cramped into half an MSQ. There wasn't enough of a buildup, and I wasn't given enough time to really get invested.\n\nHad the entire MSQ focused on either half of the story it could've been much more fleshed out, interesting and impactful in my opinion. Since this is meant as a new beginning - after the conclusion of the previous arc in Endwalker - my hope is that this story will at least serve as a good foundation for future MSQ to build upon. While I'm ready to bury the 7.0 story deep in my mind, I'm very much looking forward to what 7.1 and onward will do with the plot points and threads that have been introduced.\n\nConclusion: Of course I recommend Dawntrail. The content is fun, and the MSQ - despite being disappointing - is still worth experiencing if you care about the overall story of XIV. It's a part of the greater whole and will most likely serve as an important stepping stone for future MSQ.

Unfortunately, this latest instalment falls short in several key areas, leaving me and many others in the community feeling underwhelmed and frustrated.\n\nFirstly, the story in Dawntrail lacks the depth and emotional resonance that previous expansions delivered so masterfully. The narrative feels disjointed and rushed, with plot points that fail to engage or surprise. The new characters introduced are largely forgettable, and their development feels shallow compared to the rich, nuanced storytelling we've come to expect from the series. It\u2019s as if the writers were more focused on churning out content rather than crafting a compelling tale this time around. I've been reading comments where people compared the emotional impact of the final zones of Shadowbringers and Endwalker to Dawntrail, and I feel like I must have missed something. In the final zone of Dawntrail I felt absolutely nothing whilst the end zone of Endwalker brought me tears multiple times.\n\nGameplay mechanics have also taken a hit in Dawntrail. The new jobs and abilities introduced in this expansion seem poorly balanced and, in some cases, uninspired. The much-anticipated changes to existing classes have left many players feeling frustrated, as the reworks often simplify gameplay to the point of making it feel dull and repetitive. The combat system, once a complex and rewarding aspect of FFXIV, now feels like it\u2019s been dumbed down, reducing the satisfaction of mastering your role.\n\nI found the English Voice Acting to be really bad direction-wise. Most of it was really flat and generally unemotional from almost all characters. This is the first expansion I switched to Japanese Voice Acting.\n\nSo far Dawntrail does excel in delivering endgame content that is both challenging and interesting. The extremes are meticulously designed and the expert dungeons are more inetresting than previous expansions so far to make up a little bit of the now stale job designs.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail is a disappointing expansion that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. With a lackluster story, uninspired gameplay changes, and technical issues, it\u2019s hard to recommend this expansion to even the most dedicated fans of the series. Here\u2019s hoping the developers take the feedback to heart and address these shortcomings in future updates. I think I will give this expansion a pass, it feels uninspired and hasn't really vibed with me.", "timestamp_created": 1721686790, "timestamp_updated": 1723678971, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613322734832763672", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170484278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043143956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Just because it's the \"start of a new story/chapter\" doesn't mean it has to be this boring.

Honestly, I don't mind Wuk Lamat that much since she is a new character that needs time to grow and develop (Although her constant talk of peace and friendship make me roll my eyes so hard, it's like Japanese writer sometimes just incapable of writing something else).

Antes do n\u00edvel 97 a hist\u00f3ria principal parece algo de filme da disney de t\u00e3o tosca que \u00e9.

Algumas dungeons tem um mini boss antes do boss que realmente s\u00f3 serve de esponja de dano, achei bem esquisito isso e n\u00e3o concordo muito com tal decis\u00e3o;\n- Trilha sonora excelente;\n\nPontos mais ou menos:\n- Gr\u00e1ficos... est\u00e3o melhores mas, ainda acho que poderia melhorar bem mais, tirando as texturas qualquer ReShade da um pau nessa ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o atual;\n- 2ChannelDyes: sistema de 2 cores \u00e9 legal mas, \u00e9 uma vergonha ver um jogo do tamanho do final fantasy 14 s\u00f3 colocar isso agora enquanto outros mmos tem at\u00e9 4 channel dyes, sem contar que alguns itens que possuem 2 cores n\u00e3o fazem sentido, em uma cor vc pinta o item inteiro e na outra vc pinta os fios dos bot\u00f5es, s\u00e9rio que deixaram isso passar?\n- Balanceamento de classes: parece que n\u00e3o testaram nenhuma mudan\u00e7a de classe, tanto que em duas semanas j\u00e1 tiveram que lan\u00e7ar um patch consertando trocentas classes, e mesmo assim black mage continua uma merda, fizeram um trabalho t\u00e3o ruim nessa classe que n\u00e3o consigo descrever em palavras como estou chateado, \u00e9 comum ver gente que trocou black mage por picto j\u00e1 que picto \u00e9 uma classe forte que n\u00e3o do mesmo n\u00edvel de habilidade de blm, s\u00f3 n\u00e3o falo que \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil que summoner pq ai j\u00e1 at\u00e9 estaria desmerecendo um pouco.\n\nTLDR: expans\u00e3o com hist\u00f3ria fraca, personagens desinteressantes, balanceamento geral de classes ruins, combates no geral \u00f3timos, trilha sonora boa, sistema de tintas e gr\u00e1ficos novos deixaram bem a desejar.\nMesmo que eu n\u00e3o recomende a expans\u00e3o infelizmente ela \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria para a progress\u00e3o mas, aqui deixo meu descontentamento, espero que no futuro ela melhore e eu venha aqui mudar minha an\u00e1lise.", "timestamp_created": 1721624270, "timestamp_updated": 1721624585, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170452641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303841620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "latam", "review": "En un juego donde la historia es lo que me cautivo, esta chingadera deja mucho que desear.

Koanas party is on a random island to sabotage for us and nothing else really because when we clear it we find out we are stuck anyways, Then our boat comes to us repaired. we might have just as well stayed on the boat and helped with the repairs and been on our way. The bird people that forgot about their own traditions until Wuk Lamat goes \"maybe do that thing you stopped doing\" and Wuk Evu already knew this but he didn't wanna help them because of the challenge? the music choice at the very end before the credits was not good, that song felt so out of place too.\n\nWuk Lamat.\n\ni did really love her in post endwalker and was really excited to see how she would evolve through the story. But her character doesn't really change that much after the boat ride to Tural. She really feels like a very flat Naruto with the \"i will be hokage\" personality that changes to a \"i am the hokage\". I don't mind being a plot device for the focus on the story, like in shadowbringers it felt more that its Emmet, Ardbert and G'rahas story to tell. i think Lyse did the \"Learning to be a leader\" character development better.

Just make sure to have the proper level gear and use all of your skills to keep yourself and your team from dying.\n\n\nNow for everything else:\n\nStarting with the the rotting corpse of an elephant in the room: The Story. A filler heavy migraine-inducing experience that can best be described as Mid. From the npc's who are about as deep as an ankle-deep puddle to the endlessly monotonous tedious quests of \"Talk to X, Cutscene, Talk to X, Cutscene\" or \"listen to wuk bitch/whine/complain for X amount of minutes\", this easily proves that you need more than a first draft. Who looked at this and thought this was a worthy followup to Endwalker? Yes I am fully aware this was supposed to be the start of a new arc, but this is the equivalent of going to a restaurant you've been to for years that put out an announcement there's new \"exciting\" changes coming, but when you arrive the staff throws a can of spaghetti at you and tells you to just enjoy it. This \"expansion\" commits the two most egregious sins that an RPG could do: It does not respect your time and shoehorns an unlikable npc to the forefront while relegating you as a pet to be dragged all over creation with little to no agency on your part including dialogue choices and railroading your experience to the point where it's 90% cutscenes and 10% gameplay.\n\n\nThere's also the issue of what exactly was \"new\" as far as story, because as far as what I was able to glean there were an excruciating number of items that were copied and pasted from previous expansions:\nNPC that was focused on - Lyse from Stormblood\nAntagonist committing morally reprehensible things to \"save their people\", fusing worlds, manipulating others for their own ends over a period of many years : Emet-Selch from Shadowbringers\nMain quests involving looking at farming: Loporrits from Endwalker\nMedieval looking areas: Several places in Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker\nAntagonist that kills his own soldiers cause reasons: Zenos \nThe stupid trope of letting the bad guy walk away: Too many instances to count\nReused assets in the environments and areas clearly designed to look like Twilight Town from Kingdom Hearts\nA villain in green with a magic crown that devours souls and is an obvious manipulator: Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat. I am not even kidding about this one. \n\n\nLet's talk about those cutscenes for a moment because I just re-watched TheRussianBadger's Fallout: New Vegas video because I needed to be reminded of what good storytelling is and realized something: Nearly all of the dialogue in New Vegas is voiced, and that game is 14 years old. Want to know how much of the cutscenes in Dawntrail are voiced? Barely any of them. What exactly was the excuse for that? Did they only have an hour to record all the voice lines in the rented studio booth or something? I often found myself feeling bad for friends of mine who put their heart and soul into their work, meanwhile the VA for wuk is barely qualified to work at a drive-thru for Wendy's, yet some of the side characters (such as Bakool, Koana and the train depot NPC's) have much better VA work which makes you wonder who the hell was in charge of casting and directing. There was absolutely no excuse for the piss poor performance nor the lack of voiced cutscenes for how many there were. On top of that, the fight choreography for the fight scenes (far and few between as there were) was abysmal with 900 cuts for less than a minute that harkens back to the Taken 3 meme of a dozen cuts needed for climbing a fence. \n\n\nAnd speaking of the sound, usually the OST in each expansion has a ton of memorable tracks, but Dawntrail? I can count maybe 3-4 tracks I enjoyed and the rest were either white noise or just insufferable such as the wailing church chorus once you beat the final boss. Oh and let's not forget the bug of needing to disable the audio enhancement effects in order for the voiced cutscenes to actually be heard. There's also the manner of reused tracks for all of those cutscenes, most of which were inappropriate to the tone as well and it really just breaks what little immersion to be had since there's a ridiculous amount that you have to sit through. \n\n\nCircling back to wuk, ever since Lyse in Stormblood I have not seen an npc so deservedly and actively despised and you would've thought SE would've learned by now not to do that again, and yet here we are. Shoehorned into nearly every scene, forced to be dragged along like an npc ourselves to every interaction to the absurdly forced scene where she \"somehow\" breaks through a dome to appeal to the final boss' emotions like an episode of steven universe, and I've been struggling to figure out who this npc was supposed to appeal to because it sure as hell wasn't the playerbase. Honestly the main character should've been Koana because as shallow as the character's writing was, he at least has some worthwhile growth, hell even Bakool has some growth and again extremely shallow but at least redeemable and even dare I say likeable towards the end. Meanwhile wuk throws a pity party every 2 minutes, doesn't show any qualifications to being a qualified leader other than just listening to people, never shuts the hell up and thinks that making people smile is the most important aspect of solving a nation's issues. \n\n\nThis really feels like a bait and switch con job, especially when we were told that this was supposed to be a lower stakes vacation \nexpansion with competition involving the Scions, yet what we got was tumblr-level writing trying to make you care with overloaded sap, bad jokes and stuck on a leash being led around by the worst story-focused npc in the game's history relieving Lyse of that long-held crown. \n\n\nWhoever is in charge of staff: relegate the writers, sound editors, cutscene editors and quest makers of Dawntrail to side quests where they belong, start bringing in competent people and fix this problem before it gets any worse than it already is. I'm sure there's a lot of stuff I've missed in this review but long story short this is a travesty and an insult to both longtime players of this series and just anyone in general who enjoys storytelling, especially with the release of Elden Ring's dlc just shortly before this was released. \n\n\nOnce again, tl;dr if you're in this for just the combat, trials, dungeons, crafting, collectibles, it might be worth your time.

I expected a cool vacation/Road to El Dorado kind of story arc alongside the scions, your friends, whom you saved the world with, with hi-jinks and adventure. None of that happened. Instead, you and your friends are all in the back seat of the Wuk Lamat-mobile. They have maybe one or two lines in a scene just to remind you they are still there but otherwise you're stuck watching Wuk Lamat make a fool of herself. Y'shtola's (NA) lines seemed like they were literally phoned in?? Her audio quality is noticeably poorer next to characters she's talking to? What happened?? Additionally, Krile has a vested interest in the new world. Yet she receives maybe a story beat or two pertaining to her origins and her grandfather. For the rest, Wuk Lamat dominates the screen-time, and that screen-time is just SO boring. I found myself skipping through several parts just to get it over with, or falling asleep at its density. The first half of the expansion is just absolutely mindless fetch quests and exposition dumps. You do the tedious quests in the zone for the story's challenge and immediately after you finish, one of the other claimants walks up and has an instant solution to your hour-long fetch quest. And in another zone you have a cooking contest. How was this story approved?\n\nThis expansion leans too heavily on its brother, Shadowbringers, to be cool. There are many moments in the later half of the story that DT shouts at you \"Hey remember THIS part from Shadowbringers?? Wasn't that cool?? Here is the source version! How cool am I? Like me please!\" DT feels like it doesn't want to stand on its own and will remind you of that fact.\n\nWuk Lamat is possibly the worst character I've ever come across. The writer's perfect furry OC is stapled to your hip throughout the main story. Every minute of every quest you are FORCED to spend with Wuk Lamat. You aren't even mentoring her, you stand there, doing bunk-all. Her NA voice is pure nails on a chalkboard kind of awful and amature. She claims to want to protect peace, but thats never defined or explored, but don't worry, she'll remind you endlessly of this empty promise. The game reminds you constantly to care about Wuk Lamat and her quest \"because reasons!\" Only in the last third does an actual threat against the world emerge and you start doing what you do best does the story get more interesting. But even during the FINAL BOSS, where its YOUR time to shine, Wuk Lamat STILL manages to steal the spotlight. To her credit she at least shares the crown with her brother who isn't a complete dunce. \n\nThe zones are...fine, but several are far too gray. The big-band jazz for Tuliyolal is... a choice. The last zone just makes no sense, why make a colorful theme park to just tear it away from you? I understand the symbology plot-wise, but now i get to visit a bunch of gray rust islands for the next 3 years?\n\nDungeons are great!

It's a sign of the things to come, endless moments of Wuk Lamat being fellated by the story for achievements she only has minor, if any at all, credit to. Her character flaws, if you want to call them such, are fairly mild jokes about her easily becoming seasick, and the game will try its hardest to not let you forget about this and other \"interesting\" character attributes. Her naivete and genuinely dangerous (for a potential country leader) idealism is not shown as proper weakness, but supposedly misunderstood strength. Speaking of strength, she is also easily the strongest NPC in the game, dealing more damage than the entire party combined during the last phase of the final trial, capable of firing off multiple LB3s AND able to give the WoL the traditionally unique buff he needs to overcome all odds, something that was previously reserved for only the mightiest beings and emotional climaxes. In one scene, she not only steals our thunder, but also becomes stronger and more inspiring than all of the Scions and other side characters combined. During the entire story, nobody questions her beliefs, barely anyone dares to even speak up in regards to her actions and when they do they almost immediately get proven to be stubborn, evil or stupid. Almost every scene is either Wuk Lamat talking or someone else talking about Wuk Lamat. She's not just the focus of this expansion, she is quite literally the exclusive main character, having more lines of dialogue than almost the entire remaining cast combined. \n\nIn a time when people misuse the term \"Mary Sue\" quite a lot, Wuk Lamat actually fits that archetype shockingly well, and I'm a bit bewildered that I haven't seen anyone call her such yet. For the third time in my 10-years journey with this game I was genuinely tempted to skip cutscenes. Only Stormblood, with its utter stupidity, and the Endwalker patch series, with Zero the Hedgehog, have achieved this so far. Hiroi is a terrible, awful writer and as long as he is in any position to majorly influence the story of this game it will only get worse.

The story feels like a moral story made for children: you're constantly reminded of the overarching familial theme of the expansion and it is constantly shoehorned as the end all be all solution to all of the problems. There is no moral quandary, no physical threat, nothing that can beat the power of family. While that is fine in most JRPGs, the sheer amount of times that it felt repeated in this expansion with barely any breaks in between felt draining. I also felt like it leaned too heavily on mirroring the dilemma of previous expansions and not in a good way, it made the story feel like an unoriginal spinoff that did previous ideas worse in my opinion. \n\nThe Voice Acting for certain characters felt to be of low quality, specifically Wuk Lamat's voice during dramatic scenes fell short and a certain Scion's English voice later also felt like it was super soft spoken through a tin can. In addition, I think overall the expansion suffered from both simultaneously too many cutscenes (voiced and unvoiced) and too few important cutscenes that were voiced. There is a staggeringly large amount of cutscenes this expansion, but a lot of them felt like they were used to repeat the same information over and over that it artificially extended the expansion length and add nothing of importance to the story. Also there were quite a number of important unvoiced cutscenes following a voiced segment which made me wish that they cut down the sheer quantity of cutscenes and just had quality voiced cutscenes for important scenes rather than suddenly switching between voiced and unvoiced at the drop of a hat while giving important information out. It was jarring to have a character be speaking to you the suddenly in the next second they are a mute in the same conversation.\n\nOverall the expansion zones look beautiful and I had a blast running through them, but I strongly dislike the visual direction the later half of the story took, too many bosses and arenas look identical in the last 3 main story quest dungeons. There are plot reasons for this but at the same time it still cheapened the experience for me as running those dungeons to level future classes is less enjoyable as a lot of visual distinction is lost.\n\nCombat mechanics are improved in this expansion, there are some great QoL changes, the new jobs are fun among other things, but I just felt like the story was so disappointing this time around not only in writing but also production quality wise that I would not recommend this expansion if you only play for the story. If you play the game to raid and other things, obviously this expansion offers that but if you can be patient and wait for 8.0 story it might be worth the wait.

I can't express enough how bad the story and characters of this expansion is. If you haven't played it yet, nothing can prepare you for how utterly garbage it is, I genuinely recommend skipping each and every cutscene in the entire expansion, with the only exception possibly being the first visit to Shaaloni, as its actually somewhat decent likely due to it being the only part of the story where we are blessed with the absence of one of the most annoying and cringe characters in the known cosmos.\n\nThat character being Wuk Lamat, the main writer's self-insert OC Mary Sue. This budget-Naruto wannabe will force itself on screen anywhere they can, whether they belong or not. They will never stop spewing garbage about how all we need is peace and love, that to understand each other and being friends grants us the power of friendship, and how they will be the next Hokage- I mean, Dawnservant, believe it! If they gave you the option to assassinate Wuk Lamat, me and most others would do so in a heartbeat. It's only fair; after all, she's been desperately trying to kill the player character with cringe with every cutscene she's in.\n\nI could go into great detail over how the other characters suck too, adressing the inconsistent behaviours, character assassinations and go into detail how much of the \"plot\" makes no sense and has various plotholes, but I won't, as it would be way shorter to note the positives of the story and characters in this game, than the negatives. Frankly, this expansion deserves to be repressed in the deepest confines of the collective subconscious, and the development team should honestly offer a public apology for delivering such a disrespectfully awful product at full price, and last but not least; fire every single person on the writing team for this expansion. You might think I'm being too harsh or extreme or that I'm exaggerating, but if you play this expansion you will come to realize that this isn't just a bad expansion; it's abhorrent, its a stain on the legacy of this game as a whole.\n\nSome people claim this expansion gets good at the 30% mark, 50%, 70% or 90%. I've played through the entirety of it, and I can assure you it's all garbage, but I will give credit where credit is due; only the first 50% of this game is loaded with cringe, while the remaining 50% just being plain boring, tedious and bad (with the exception of the final trial, where they made sure to shoehorn in an extra large dose of cringe to make sure you hate this expansion and the character Wuk Lamat with a heartfelt passion).\n\nAt least the music is good. The dungeons are excellent. The open-area zones are pretty good.\nWhich is why this is the first time in this game's history where I recommend skipping cutscenes. If you skip every cutscene of this expansion, you will probably enjoy it a lot. I imagine this expansion being the equivalent to Borderlands 3 in that aspect.\n\nSo when all is said and done, if you're still buying this expansion, don't tell me I didn't warn you.", "timestamp_created": 1721394554, "timestamp_updated": 1721437519, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535989999771118164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170231293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103470614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "FFXIV Downtrail: Wuk Lamat is VERY off putting \n- The character is awful - too much in to my face than I would like.\n- The personality is more main character than the actual main character.\nIsn't the idea to play MY character actually, than enduring the behaviour of a profane NPC.\nI do regret purchasing the expansion.

It isn't bad as some say. It's mid. \nIt could've been worse. But in definitely could've been much better.\nI don't mind some other character to be a main protagonist of an expansion (Lyse was fine).\nWhen said protagonist is annoying and shoved in every nook and cranny, steals spotlight not only from you (the main character of the game) but from the side characters as well, it's a bad writing. \nOther characters barely got any screentime to shine.\nAnd that's because Wuk Lamat is poorly written.\nAnother part of it - villains. Or lack there of. We got few smaller foes which are excused from their misdeeds because they had their own MOTIVATION. Excused and forgiven right away. Are we supposed to feel sorry for murderers? No, that's not how proper villains work.\n\n[b]Music[/b] has very few tracks. And even fewer noticable ones. It lacks character. And when it doesn't, it's replaced by ARR music. Quite often I might add. When I arrived to 4th Wild West zone, I couldn't help myself but turn on Crisis Core's \"[b]Wandering on a sunny afternoon[/b]\" and \"[b]Moonlight wandering[/b]\". Because Crisis Core's music fits MUCH BETTER for that zone.\nThey could've gone into spaghetti western feel for music and added harmonica into that soundtrack or some other instruments like jaw harp. But nah. It's just average uninspired guitar/piano music. It's there.\nCapital city of Tuliyollal has jazz music. Why jazz music for Mayan/Mexican inspired city? Why can't we have some more fitting Spanish fiesta or something like that?\n\n[b] Dungeon/Trail mechanics [/b] are bullshit. Not all of them but some. You gotta scan boss area in 360 degrees every second to see what's coming. Or watch/read a guide. And instead of showing mechanic incoming with visuals like wind or aoe marker, SE decided to put just a small red text on top of a screen. Enjoy reacting in time to that if you're a slow reader.\n\n[b] Job changes [/b] is what killed a few of the jobs I enjoyed. Dragoon can't goon no more. They removed OGCD damage jump skill with average slide to enemies skill with no damage. Dragoon's main thing is to jump like a bullet onto enemies and pierce them with lance. But we can't do that no more. As well as we can't have a damage boost to ourselves and one teammate. Black mage is another one who received poor treatment. It was at peak in EW with few ways to recover your rotation. Now it's only one way. Ice no longer passively returns mana. You can't cast lighting skills without proc. Ice paradox is gone.\n\n[b] Expansion doesn't even feel like one[/b]. There. I said it. Dawntrail doesn't feel like an expansion to me personally. Even post Endwalker patch story feels more like an expansion. Nothing really exciting happens. It's like ARR all over again and we are nothing but a newbie adventurer. Pray return to WUKing Sands. When cutscene tries to be funny and even has funny music, nothing funny actually happens. When cutscene tries to be touching, nothing really touching actually happens. Same stuff with inspiring music. It tries to hype us up with ARR music but nothing worth noting actually happens.\nIt's hollow through and through. As a start of new post-Zodiark saga it's a miss for me.\n\nYoshi-P, please return Natsuko Ishikawa as a main writer.

You, as the main character, take a dramatic back seat to the story to become a yes-man and a hired muscle. Taking away the focus from the player vastly reduces the investment of most player's interest in the story (myself included) because we no longer have a stake in what's going on outside of being bodyguards. The story doesn't really pick up until halfway through and by then, all the interesting parts of the MSQ felt hugely rushed because the first 20 hours of the 30 hour MSQ are spent talking to NPCs, doing fetch quests for ingredients and maybe 1 dungeon and 1 trial. \n\nThere's just so much text and dialogue and inconsequential cutscenes that play that you can reasonably skip any of them that are not voiced and have all the context you need without having missed anything important and I'm saying this as someone who is a firm believer in watching every cutscene and reading every dialogue. This is the first expansion in FFXIV history to get me to skip dialogue and even some cutscenes here and there. Heck, I even fell asleep a couple times too. \n\nThe voice acting is a big deal for a lot of people and while I enjoyed most of them, I found Erenville and Wuk Lamat really hard to listen to after a few hours especially when line delivery was needed to drive some semblance of emotion. I played the entire expansion in English as I often do but after the final trial and due to some very not-good line deliveries, I've reluctantly swapped to Japanese just in the off chance I get that trial in my Daily Roulette. \n\nThe Pros:\nDungeons are pretty par for the course but I can't complain as long as we get to wall-to-wall pull and vaporize an entire group of enemy mobs. Downside is most dungeons really amount to \"jungle and/or desert\" which isn't my favorite aesthetic but if you love those locations, you'll probably love a lot of the dungeons. Some of the better changes though have been in bosses and trials thus far which actually have some very unique mechanics that require more thought than \"dodge the big glowing orange circle\". I think what's going to be the biggest form of player retention is going to be the raids, dungeons and trials of this expansion because they really are some of the best yet or at least a small step up from what we've had before. \n\nIf you're someone who doesn't really care about the story either which way and plays mostly for the end game content and the grind, the expansion is worth getting for that. If you're someone that enjoys the story and getting to see your player character get to do amazing things and interact with your other favorite characters, sadly there isn't much of that here and is a major drop off compared to what we've had before.", "timestamp_created": 1721330289, "timestamp_updated": 1721330289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "170186162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030892118", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish I could put a side-ways thumb as I am torn on this expansion.

It's surprising how quickly this game went from it's peak experience with Endwalker to fumbling the ball hard in it's post-game content releases and landing on Dawntrail, revealing the unfortunate truth that they're out of ideas. It's of my opinion that they should have ended the game in its entirety with Endwalker and just focused on developing some stellar end game content in the interim until they decided what they would do for FFXIV-2 (or whatever they would have called it). Unless they change their tune, this game has begun it's slow death spiral where any semblance of what made the game great slowly gets phased out for the sake of change and the writing just gets worse and worse. People aren't exaggerating about the character Wuk Lumat. Her voice is particularly grating because they chose a terrible voice actor for the role who sounds like they're doing their best impression of a furry which makes it incredibly hard to take the character seriously, let alone her character development and dialogue is terrible. Same goes for the plot. When I originally started playing FFXIV, I was skipping dialogue and cutscenes because WoW had conditioned me into believing that a story in and MMO was not worth your time. I stopped that habit in Shadowbringers and was blown away by the story, even going back and revisiting the previous plot lines so I could get immersed in the world. Now I've gone right back to skipping cutscenes and dialogue because I just can't take it anymore - It's too boring. It's WAY too boring. And once you start skipping you start to see how much of the gameplay is just you running 200 meters and initiating another cutscene over and over. I'm approaching that point where I might unfortunately be done with this game. All the jobs I liked playing have either been ignored, gutted, or lost their core identity.

But it is at least in my opinion overshadowed by just how laser focused the main story quest is on a single character. No other expansion has ever revolved around a single person so much. Not even Stormblood; which was quite heavily focused on Lyse, was so extremely skewed as Dawntrail is. Which is a move that can only hope to be successful with a character that is well liked and or has already built up quite a connection with the player in the past. Which with this character being new is not possible. It is also not helped that while the Wol's role was meant to be a mentor and guide but we never really do any guiding. The only thing we ever really did that even fit that role was when she began to doubt herself or her choice, was to tell her to keep doing what she is already doing because she was already doing the right thing.\n\nThough It was not so bad as to tank the expansion at least when it seemed that the time of that characters reign was going to end at about the halfway point. It however did not and a few quests later they were back and the center of the main story quests focus once more all the way through and especially in the very end. This was the hardest blow for me as with their seemingly leaving the content left them in a mostly positive light.

First of all, the main quest line is extremely boring, not because of the story itself, but rather because it's full of unnecessary filler quests. After getting to level 95, I said to myself: okay, it looks like the game is finally going to pick up. Nope, a few moments later, I was back to doing tons of dreadful filler quests. Additionally, all of your companions completely lost their personality. They all feel and talk exactly the same: \"Oh, we're always here to help. You're doing great, pal. Friends forever!\"... give me a break.\n\nThe quest design is also the same as it was years ago: talk with person A -> talk with person B -> talk with person A -> talk with person A again! I was okay with it in the two previous expansions, because at least the story was good. Now, it feels like I am forced to sit through a very long and boring movie with a few good moments.\n\nAdditionally, the design of each expansion is exactly the same: 100 main quests, 10 more levels, 2 new classes, a few raids, grinding for relics... This starts to feel like the company takes the players for granted and is not interested in taking any risks. In my opinion, a good example is the dragoon \"rework\". The job feels as busy and chaotic as it did in the previous expansions, with some skills removed and replaced by additional ones. The healers haven't changed at all either.\n\nNot every thing is bad of course: most of the jobs are very fun to play, the new dungeons are challenging and well designed, the visual effects are enjoyable. I also don't have Wuk Lamat like everyone else :). At least she has some personality compared to your other companions!\n\nIn conclusion, I still love the game.

No I did not enjoy a single dungeon or trial due to how easy they are for me because of the game's combat \"engine\". It is FAR too simple and I am losing interest. \n\nMy problem with this expansion is also the very blatant formula we're following for several expansions and that the combat and content hasn't changed and it likely won't. I don't think the game only needs \"harder\" combat, I think they need to change the combat, enemies, mechanics, roles and classes and make it far different. At most I'd prefer a whole new combat system like an ARPG instead of this chess game with no vertical movement; In the game, try to jump over a hole and land onto something else by using elusive jump on dragoon, it doesn't work because there is no verticals in combat and you'll see my biggest problem with this game. It could be fun if they expanded on mechanics like having to time jumps or adding dodges.  As an example: teleporting is not real on any class, use a ninja smoke bomb and teleport, it's a dash, not a teleport. Urianger in dungeons can properly teleport instead of dodging, showing that THEY CAN add it, they just don't want to, do the Dohn Mehg dungeon in Trust and see what he does in the final fight during the bridge mechanic. Since ShB every class feels the same and it's getting worse. If 7.2 doesn't change the game to extreme amounts that are a lot more intriguing, hard, and keeps your attention on every enemy, keeping it fun and less sleep heavy this will be my last expansion. Clown react or not, this expansion and the game is going in an awfully annoying and boring direction I don't support and I think not too far into the future other veterans will agree with me. The balancing for the classes are questionable to me, this new idea of a max amount of buttons is pathetic to me. This same loop through every expansion of 3 alliance raids, 12 normal raids and some dungeons feels lazy even if it is a lot of content. The story and the game falls apart to me when I can figure out what the next fight and how the story is going to play out just by looking at the MSQ level. There should be inconsistencies to keep everything interesting, not a content formula that everyone can pick up on through the expansions.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm a dungeon player, not a raider, I've done raiding and it's traumatizing and mentally tiring to be with 8 people, I level everything to max every expansion and this time I don't even feel for it most of the time. I like playing repetitively, I would really like to have a dungeon variant for Savage and Ultimate raids and I don't mean Criterion and Variant dungeons. I'd like mythics from WoW or Fractals from Guild Wars 2, just replaying the dungeons with modifiers, that would be fun for me and I would want that to reward you with a lot more end game tomestones and gear than what you'd get just playing normal dungeons in the end game. I know it may sound like I am tired of the game because of the dungeons, I am not, I still love the dungeons, I don't like the balancing and I want more dungeons, I just wish the dungeons had more to them than being pitifully resourceful for leveling. I do not care for other content like raids, alliance raids, trials and so on, that's for other people to enjoy, not me, they are not fun for me and I have done a decent amount of everything in all my time.\n\nWhether you agree or not, I don't care, it's my review, it's how I feel about the game. It's going down the drain for me.

I like the new jobs and the new map areas are great.  The graphics update was sorely needed and has genuinely overall improved the look of the game minus some nitpicks.\n\nHaving said that, I play for the story and this time it was a huge miss.  It had the bones of an interesting narrative that just felt like it was squandered at every turn by an amateur writer with no idea how to write in character voice or any concept of nuance.  Wuk Lamat felt nearly like someone's 'OC don't steal' by the second half and I'm annoyed that the writers made me end out hating a character I initially liked to the point of irritation if I have to even see her face.  Over saturation and poor characterisation along with poorly directed voice lines was a disservice in every respect, to the player, the story, the character and the voice actress.  The Scions themselves felt one note and written by someone who'd heard about them.  I was genuinely looking forward to taking a backseat and playing mentor but I didn't really feel I did that either.  Also, mentoring someone to become a leader? Surely G'raha was better suited.  I should have been on a pub crawl with Estinien.\n\nThe themes were presented in a manner that feels like it's catering to an audience of 8-12 year olds.  Not to say it was completely devoid of good moments.  It had one that genuinely almost felt like the previous expansions in terms of depth and character and a couple of one sided character moments but they were too brief, too few and too far between.  I have genuinely loved this game for just short of 10 years and I cannot in good faith defend this expansions writing.  I have never taken this long to complete the MSQ and I have never before arrived at the doorstep of a final trial and just turned the game off.  I was genuinely looking forward to maybe jumping back into the extremes this time round but after getting through the final trial I turned the game off and haven't been back since.  I gave it a fair go, I went in with high hopes, did not skip , avoided spoilers for the most part and went into it determined to make my own conclusions (I loved ARR and anyone who thinks it's bad is entitled to that but I genuinely do not agree even if it had some wobbly bits).  I just have had no enthusiasm and it feels empty.

If you've played since ShB, you can play every single job in the game because NOTHING changed. The only difference is that now, instead of pressing your burst skill every 2 minutes, you press your burst skill twice in a row every two minutes. Combine the fact that there are zero job changes or improvements with the fact that the story is dogshit this time around and you've got a real recipe for disaster. \n\nDon't even get me started on the voice acting, this time around they left it up to the Americans and like everything else they touch, it crumbles and dies. They decided this time around to hire a transexual from Kentucky to play the role of a female latino main character, obviously this did not sound very convincing and takes you out of the game. The dialogue during the final boss fight is so poorly voice acted, it's become a meme of its own.  \n\n---Schizo theory time---\n\nMuch of the story has been very crudely cut from the final product shortly before release. I claim this simply by the fact that there are plently of obvious plotlines and implied conflicts completely removed from the release version of the game. \nOne example I can name of the top of my head is the entire zone of \"Shaaloani\". Shaaloani is a very obvious reference to a new frontier western setting. All the characters live in crude houses and act like cowboys, the zone's story is about a bandit gang being in league with the sheriff and doing some general evil bandit stuff before facing off with... Rubber bullets...?\nNow, in the zone there's also an entire area dedicated to another group of people styled after a nomadic native tribe. You visit this zone for what can't be more than 10 minutes to perform a singular quest, where - completely unrelated to the storyline of the zone - the natives americans mention that they're very much upset about new cowboy people coming in and disturbing nature by building infrastructure such as trains. They explain this calmly, the cowboys go \"okay, thank you for sharing\" and then they resolve their differences...? What?\nWhat I suspect happened here is that the ever ominous \"consulting company\" Yoshi mention in a previous live letter saw the pre release version of the zone, which I imagine was a typical plot something along the lines of: The natives disagree with and sabotage technological progress of the cowboys, the cowboys retaliate since they see the natives as terrorists, they eventually reach an understanding after learning eachother's motives, they find a balance between nature and progress, applause.\nI can imagine the american company walking in, saying \"You can't have cowboys shooting natives and vice versa, it's \"INSENSITIVE\". Shut. It. Down.\" forcing a late stage rewrite to what we have today. Thus leaving the native zone completely unused as it is now.\nIn much the same way, I feel that the entire continet of Tural has had it's bite removed.

A good 5/10. The worldbuilding and designs of the first zones + music were top notch tho.\n\nBut I'm honestly not a fan of what they did in the second half of the MSQ. \nI expected it to be nothing extraordinary, because it's the start of a new adventure, but despite that I found it very underwhelming, from the motivations of the villains to the writing of the story.\nSome moments are also really cringe-worthy, although I never had a problem with all the cheesy friendship moments in previous addons.\n\nBringing the Scions back straight after Endwalker was completely unnecessary (Some- or all of them shoud have died in EW, their story was finished and it would have been a great end... OR make them disappear for more than 2 expansions before letting them show up again, to make it interesting, but no...), not enough happens with them. They were practically not needed and they could have just established new, fresh characters instead...\n\nAnd it's a shame that Ishikawa didn't write the story this time, you can clearly feel it\n\nOne of my biggest complaints... WHY are the devs still so afraid of changing the FF14 formular and trying something risky again ???\nEvery addon is so calculated. It gets so mundane and boring still continuing the same formular (with only small changes) for all those years. Dawntrail could have been the addon to really change things up in terms of gameplay, new player accessibility, story presentation and overall gamedesign for quests and such... but no\n\nThey could have tried changing the Dungeons in some way again, instead of doing 3 bosses and 3 hallways every time. Make them smaller but larger in number? or change the way gear is destributed over the dungeons? Making them harder was great, but its hardly anything groundbreaking new...\nchange up fates by making them harder and more complex. A lot of cutscenes should've been solo duties, but aren't. The lack of voice acted cutscenes is also really apparent.\nMake more smaller zones and 2 really big zones for example, or go back to older zones and expand on them, stop sticking to 6 zones in every expansion, experiment more. Every expansion is sooo predictable, and after all those years i want to see more change...\n\n-SPOILERS-\nWHY include the second Hub City in the Marketing this time?!?! [spoiler]It would have been a great twist not knowing that the game would change so much in the second half. The first zones and the trailer would have been enough to sell the game to me... \n\nI really didnt like where it was going in terms of design- and story/lore wise in the second half. Hated the NPC designs in solution 9. Aswell as the whole Phantasy Star Online and Tron like designs. I have nothing against sci-fi, i like the allagan look... but I don't like this style at all. At least not in an FF.\n\nThe whole soul/memory transfer thematic is so overused in games and movies, same as timetravel plots. Im glad its over now, and i hope we never see this thematic again, PLEASE don't let it be a thing in the post DT MSQ... [/spoiler]\n\nI'm also not a fan of zones that can never be visited again from a story perspective. That just makes the world/tural seem very small and unconnected to me. I would have hoped that, after they've done it like this for two expansions, it might be handled like in Stormblood again, with 6 zones that are all part of the world... but no.", "timestamp_created": 1721077932, "timestamp_updated": 1721318703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508304476737976074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169951430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452033680", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The story of the expansion was an absolute disappointment this time, to a degree even I'm surprised. I never had such urge to skip lines and lines of pointless and boring dialogue and quests before.

It starts boring and it ends annoying and boring. I also had to change the voice acting from English to German, not because I understand any German, but because I couldn't stand the sublevel of voice acting of Wuk Lamat. The voice actor shows the emotion level of a log, in other words, it was completely amateurish and bland. \n\nMost of the quests were of course meaningless fetch quests for the beast tribes, but this time it was much harder to tolerate them because the story didn't lead to anything interesting, and I knew at the end of each quest I would get basically nothing.\n\nThe feeling of being a side character in the story didn't appeal to me, and I didn't even understand why the Scions were there because they also did basically nothing. They felt like that kid in a tree costume in the school plays. \n\nIn summary, bad writing and character creation, bad dialogue and bad quests.

They might as well not have been there. \n\nThe second half feels rushed and not letting the weight of events or giving the character arcs other then wuklamat the time and air they need. Which makes it frustrating as it genuinely has interesting concepts to play with, yet it is over within 2 dungeons and 2 zones. \n\nIts also conflicting on themes. From heritage to family and parentage, yet all the setup for these themes pays off very little.  Even the bad guy just gets 2 lines about feeling spurned by his farther; in the epilogue after he is dead, thats it; thats what you get. A lot of characters can be summed up in 2 lines.  \n\nIts a lot of tell don't show and it repeats some messages over and over.  It doesn't set a lot up for whats to come next and wraps up too many of the actual interesting questions within hours. With throw away lines here or there. \n\nStill worth playing, on a lot of levels.

Even the new job, Pictomancer, is an absolute blast to play and most certainly my favorite of the caster jobs.\n\nHowever, the same couldn't be said for the story of this expansion, which I can safely say is some of the absolute worst writing I've ever come across; mixed with a myriad of factors that makes for an utterly miserable MSQ experience.\n\nThe sheer incompetence of the new lead writer and his utter inability to write a world beyond the depth of a puddle have severely hurt the story of the expansion. Piss-poor attempts at world-building, which this expansion heavily focuses on, is instead met with \"I've already seen this before, but done more interesting, and less tedious, preachy, hamfisted and doesn't take 10+ quests worth of padding and poor dialogue.\" This results in a absolute slog in an experience where nothing important ever happens and you're forced to read through worthless lore bits that provides nothing of value to you as a player. While this problem was always apparent in the entirety of FFXIV, Dawntrail puts it on a whole other level.\n\nNow, to address the elephant in the room, the reason why the expansion stinks as hard as does, can be chalked down to the expansion' s focal character - Wuk Lamat, aka Furry Naruto. The only concrete thing I can tell you about this character is that she loves peace. and that the writer is utterly in love with her and NEEDS everyone to know it. Making a newly introduced character the main focus in a brand new adventure is by no means a bad thing, in fact it could even be a breathe of fresh air; watching the perspective of another while your player character plays the role of an observer / mentor is an idea worth exploring. \n\nThe problem with Dawntrail and Wuk Lamat, however, is that the writer felt the need to shove her in your face for every single minute thing, no matter how insignificant, at the expense of every single other character. 90% of the game's dialogue involves her in some form, returning characters are robbed of all agenda, instead turning into mouthpieces to further sing praises to the beloved black hole of a character. Any of her perceived \"flaws\" are barely considered as such, and only used in comedic scenes, if not only to lead to NPCs reassuring her of how awesome she it. Wuk Lamat's presence in the story is the equivalent of a person standing [i]waaaaay[/i] too close to you while talking. Ironically enough, for how invasive she is in the story, the most enjoyable portions of the MSQ are when she's not around. \n\n[i]I've grown to love Wuk Lamat! Everyone she meets will come to love her too![/i] - Daichi Hiroi, lead writer of this mess.\n\nAntagonists that directly opposes the creator's pet behaves like an underage bully, akin to characters in a Dhar Mann video. Further exploration of the antagonists in an attempt to humanize them only serves to exacerbate my grievances with the way they write villains in this expansion. They have clear motivations, sympathetic backstories....which still doesn't explain why they are so over-the-top, cartoonishly evil in the first place. \n\nThe most unforgivable thing that led me to write this review, the one event that led me to look upon this expansion with almost disdain, is [spoiler] the Final Trial. A rare moment in this mess of an MSQ where your player character is given any agency as a character instead of an over-glorified background prop. A very strong build-up to the showdown, followed by an extremely interesting and mechanically engaging final boss fight, coupled with fantastic music to accompany the experience. After a very dissatisfying experience with the story, I would love for something that could end the entire expansion on a high note....then in the final stretch of the fight, a cutscene plays and Wuk Lamat hijacks the fight once again, essentially stealing your thunder, and robbing you of what little you have as a character. I have genuinely no idea what the writer is thinking when he wrote this scene, is he that over-confident that people will love this character so much? To add further insult to injury, the remainder of the fight becomes a victory lapse, as Wuk Lamat is so powerful she starts levitating in the air and going full medieval on the boss, blatantly dealing far more DPS than your entire party combined while giving you a buff that explicitly states that you, the player character, is so inspired by this creator's pet that you break mortal limits. This is a level of pandering that puts even Empress Theresa to shame, and I am frankly amazed by the writer's gall to even entertain the idea that people will like this. This very moment turns what could've been a solid 10/10 fight for me into a 1/10, and never before have any game left such a pit in my stomach. Thought that you can \"skip the story, enjoy the game?\" Too bad, the Furry Naruto will hijack the boss fight as well. [/spoiler]\n\nMy only hope for the future of this game's story is that the current lead writer [i]never[/i] writes anything ever again, and that the post-launch MSQ dial back on the blatant character favoritism and learn to give others a room to breathe.\n\nI'm glad to see that I'm just one of the many players who shares the same grievances with the writing. I hope to see things improve in future patches, and maybe, just maybe, will they finally give more screen time to characters who sorely needs them; like a certain lalafell who became a Pictomancer for this brand new adventure, only to become a background prop for all but a few quests in the MSQ. \n\nPoor f*cking Krile, she deserves more than this.", "timestamp_created": 1721037512, "timestamp_updated": 1721037643, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758611023426055908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169911268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150100425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "waklamut", "timestamp_created": 1721031013, "timestamp_updated": 1721031013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442514389753341675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169911069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096705335", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't wait to go back to work so I don't have to play Dawntrail anymore.\nI wish I could just play a different game, but I have an FC to run and a good number of friends who want to run the content.\nThe story is full of plot-holes and I don't think SE is going to go back and fill them in if STB is anything to go off of. \nWith any luck the next expac will be better.

Some people don't like 'one' specific song, but I didn't particularly mind it. It's just not for everyone (also could have been 'when' it was played that threw a lot of people off).\n\nCONS (Minor spoilers)\n- Alright...so, the main issue is the story. A lot of people are defending it, saying that it has to start off slow like ARR...but ARR's story writing wasn't bad, it was just slow and that's fine.\n- There is a sincere lack of maturity in the writing and main confrontations. To be fair, I'm all for a positive, feel-good expansion, but the story-telling here left a lot to be desired.\n- Wuk Lamat's character had a lot of missed potential. Again, I don't mind the positivity at all, it's just the execution. \n- I don't mind stepping into a mentoring (or side character) role, but I wish I could have offered more mentoring opportunities and/or chances to help other characters grow (without just being hired muscle). \n- SO MUCH TELL, DON'T SHOW. The writers of this expansion just HAD to tell you 100x times what their message is, and force-feed it to you. AGAIN, I like these positive themes, but the BEST stories are written with a 'show', don't 'tell' method.\n\nSUMMARY\nI understand that some people are saying that the negative reviews are 'too harsh'. I have to disagree, because the collective stories wrapped up within FFXIV's universe are wonderful and loved by many. I can't, in good faith, give this a positive review when the most compelling part of this game is the story itself. This expansion deserves the mixed reviews (unfortunately), and I sincerely hope that whatever is going on in the writing team sorts itself out.\n\nTLDR\nEstinien gets a cool vacation, and we get subscribed to Disney Plus for kids.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1721005446, "timestamp_updated": 1721005446, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538610994815826416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169893556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989160561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh boy, where to start.........\nI am not going to write some lengthy review (ill let others do that).\nDawntrail has to be the one of the *worst* expansions ever-- serious letdown.

Now this wasn't only found in Wuk but there was other moments with some of the other newer characters that also had moments of the acting being lacking in the emotion.\n\n\nVisuals (this is a positive)\n\nAs for the visuals and level design, It was great and most likely the best thing they did this expansion. the zones felt mostly unique and vibrant except for one spot but that's BIG spoilers sorry.\n\n\nCombat, Dungeons, and Trials oh my\n\n- Combat changes, I can only speak for DRG and GNB at the moment. DRG is my main class and it took some time to get used to but the changes feel ok, not sure if I like them more than what they where though. as for GNB which is my main tank, I don't play tank as much but GNB didn't get much in changes but new abilities and they feel great\n- Dungeons this expansions are eh, Visual they're great except for the first one, wasn't a fan. They tried to make them more \"Stressful\" which I think they over did it. at least one of the bosses in the dungeons has awful mechanics. I wouldn't mind if it was in post expansion content or side content that's aimed for endgame but for Leveling dungeons it needs to be toned down a smidge.\n- Trials are great, they feel and look great so not much to say here\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nnot sure what happened but the writing for this expansion was a let down. I wasn't expecting Shadowbringers or Endwalker but it was forced at the end, I feel like they should have ended it at the death of a certain character and left the last half to build up in post content and then be the focus for the next expansion.

The jobs that do function received abilities that are, in a word, \"safe.\" Most major cooldowns either turn into or grant a single big hit that effectively adds nothing of interest to the gameplay beyond \"big number fun.\"\nThe writing is poorly done from a technical sense, with us often being told details about characters that we never see in action. Events from the last quest are summarized immediately. Entire segments of the plot rely entirely on our party of seasoned adventurers and scholars behaving as complete and utter morons. None of the main cast of Scions are given any real character arc, and the character arcs for new characters that we do receive resolve far too quickly and anticlimactically. \nToo much time is spent on extremely shallow and one-note worldbuilding. We're supposed to appreciate the cultures of these different people within Tural, but are only really given a single point and a 1-paragraph summary of their history that is regurgitated again and again until it's time to move on.\nThe excuse of it being a new story arc is often used to shield the game against these complaints, but being the start of a story does not excuse the lack of technical skill and care present in the writing.\nWith all that said, there are some side characters and antagonists whom I do think were well-written and enjoyable, but they were overshadowed badly.

I've read summer holiday stories of 7 year old children that had more depth and development.\n\nI can even sum it up with one paragraph: \"Little Wuk Lamat - the Saturday morning kids show character - goes on a round-trip, becomes mega-super-duper-awesome and fights the evil villains with the power of friendship and by completely ignoring logic, common sense and plotholes and after that everyone clapped.

I'll just keep crafting while waiting for patches...\n\n-------\n\nAlmost 3 months in, writing in an edit, and changing review to negative. Raids were fun, content structure is identical or slightly improved to other expansions, but the MSQ keeps coming back to haunt me. The second half of MSQ makes Dawntrail the worst expansion yet. First half felt like tolerable preparations for things to come, but the final three zones are very poorly written. It seems like different writers took over different segments of the story, and HO BOY, it is rough in the major plot development department for level 95 onwards.\n\nSome people really hate the amount of screentime Wuk Lamat gets over all other characters, and that is valid. They must've written the story with the intention of recording the least amount of voicelines for the Scions, because every moment they appear, they're quickly hurried out of frame or do nothing in the current situation, despite clearly having the ability or motivations to. Even the WoL gets denied countless opportunities to jump in, just to move the plot forward how the writers wanted, or let Wuk Lamat be the main character. These were a handful of the \"mid or cringe\" bits, but not all of them. They cut as much Scion screentime as possible, and don't get why they had them come with us.\n\nThe villains motivations are poorly written or nonexistent. Much of the developments that occur in the second half of MSQ are poorly written or unexplained. We're apparently just on a Wuk Lamat rollercoaster and no Scion has any screen time long enough to help her make intelligent decisions, instead of us just following around and watching shit unfold without us getting to do anything. \n\nIt's a huge letdown after Endwalker. I knew it was going to have to take some risks to establish a new MSQ story arc, but those last 2-3 zones really just took the wind out of the sails.

Much better lighting and texturing, but it's subtle enough to retain the game's style.\nDungeons and Trials: The dungeons and trials are the best part of the expansion. They are more challenging than usual and have some fun new mechanics.\nMusic: I almost put this in the MEH category since a lot of old music was recycled this expansion. And some music did not fit the situation. Considering this is supposed to be the beginning of a new arc, I would have thought they'd put more effort into new music. However, most of the new music is very good.\nThe MEH:\nVoice Acting (English): Considering how much money this game has made and how important the story is to that success, it is inexcusable how little voice acting there is in the MSQ and how much of the voice acting is wasted on non-essential NPCs. The quality of the voice acting was inconsistent, both in sound quality and delivery. Wuk Lamat's VA did an ok job with what they had to work with.\nThe BAD: (!SPOILERS AHEAD!)\nExpectations: If all you saw of Dawntrail before release was the cinematic trailer, then you will be confused and disappointed. The trailer makes it look like you are embarking on a new adventure and a new mystery with your pals from the Scions, with you taking a leading role as usual. Wuk Lamat isn't seen until the very end of the trailer and only for a few seconds. Wuk Lamat is the entire expansion. You do almost nothing without her and she is taking the lead in almost everything. The Scions are barely involved and even when they are they are wasted. To me, this was a huge let-down.\nThe Story: TLDR: It's bad on many levels.\nIf you like Shounen, you will love this. If you're tired of childish anime tropes, you will hate this. This might as well be called Dawntropes. \nWuk Lamat is ignorant and immature despite being raised by a competent leader. She is Naruto from Wish. Everything just works out for her in the most contrived way possible and every tragedy she endures was avoidable if the writers weren't using anime logic for everything.\nBakool JaJa is evil on the level of an old cartoon villain and their attempt to give him a redemption arc was so sloppy it was insulting. Any competent authority would have put him to death for the things he did.\nZoraal Ja's character arc was more like a crazy straw. He wants to teach people the important of peace by going to war. Yet he expresses absolutely no love or interest or concern for anyone, to the point of murdering his most loyal supporter. He talks about the Garlean empire like they were a bunch of idiots for trying to rule the world with force alone yet that is all Zoraal Ja ever tries to use. He's a hypocrite and an idiot and no one calls him out on it. All attempts to paint him as a complex villain was terribly done.\nSphene's entire objective makes no sense and one of your companions even points it out. But someone else interrupts before Sphene responds to them. She claims to need souls or life energy specifically to keep the memories of her people alive. We already know this is a lie because our companions were transferred (memory and soul) from the First back to the Source using a crystal with no need for additional power. On top of that, all physical and spiritual matter is made of up Aether in FFXIV. Including memories and souls. Life energy IS aether. And even if they needed a more specific element of aether, they have a technology called Electrope that converts electricity into other elements of aether. And even assuming her need for souls was true, she will inevitably run out when she wipes out all the other reflections. So her plan makes no sense no matter how you look at it. I get that she's more like an AI than a real person, but she was created by supposedly intelligent people who should have known better.\nWhat's the deal with missing parents and unexplained deaths? Wuk Lamat meets her real father, but no mention of her mother. Erenville has a mother but never even knew his father's name. Plus, his mother dies but not from old age, so what happened to her? Zoraal Ja is essentially a prince, but there's no mention of who his mother is. Zoraal Ja has a son, but once again, no mention of a mother. For both of these people it would be incredibly out of character for them to mate with someone who meant nothing to them. Krile's parents are dead, but probably not from old age so what happened to them? And what kind of parents hand off their baby to the first random people they meet? One of them being a huge and scary-looking two-headed lizard. And what were the odds of them opening the gate to the Source just when they happened to be in the room?\nI could go on and on about plot holes and bad character development, but you get the picture. The story feels badly paced and rushed. They could have easily stretched the Rites to cover the entire expansion and saved Sphene's part for the patch content. It would have given them a lot more time to develop their characters more naturally and given the different cultures of Tural more than lip service. It felt like \"diversity for diversity's sake\".\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you skip all the dialogue and cutscenes and just focus on the actual gameplay, you'll probably have a good time. If you play FFXIV for the story, you might have a good time if you just turn your brain off.

The story had so much potential but (kinda spoiler) the first half feels soooo pointless after the 'big reveal'. And also the first 20h was very boring sadly. The villain was very shallow, the twist was nice but the pacing was so weird that the emotional impact that FF14 usually has just didnt hit right this time.

Not much change since EW, just ability enhancement and a few changes but nothing major and different.\n\n- Shallow interaction and forced dialogues.

I've played WoW a lot in my life and FFXIV always excelled over WoW to me because it could produced a story I cared about (and the music is way better in FF too). Well this expac no longer does that. This story is all about one character that isn't your character her name is Wuk Lamat, and the MSQ writers shove this character in your face constantly. I never skipped cut scenes before this expac and I've been playing since ARR but I started skipping this expac. I dislike Wuk Lamat and how integrated she is with every facet of the MSQ. I am not joking when I say I enjoy ARR more than this expac.

How we got an expansion story this basic, and awful is beyond me. It is akin to putting your nose to a dog's behind and inhaling deeply. \n\nNo, I was not expecting a high stakes story, this was supposed to be a fun vacation, but it is not, you will speak to Wuk Lamat 104 times in the MSQ as a quest step. Someone actually counted. \nNo, I did not skip the cutscenes, but I wish I had.\nYes, the cutscenes and quest design actually made me exit the game and go to bed multiple times because I was yawning the entire way through. \n\nYes, the ENG voice actors that are US natives. (Wuk Lamat, several NPC's in the ' FF Texas' zone.) Are WAY below the standard of voice acting I would expect Square Enix to hire. Turns out voice actors from the States just absolutely SUCK and should not be used ever again if we can help it, lest we return to the horrors of ARR ENG dub. The cast that we got in HW are stage actors and severely outclass their US counterparts to the point I consider it insulting Wuk Lamat has 456% more voiced lines than any other NPC in the expansion. \n\nThere is a distinct lack of Voice over work on critical parts of the story too, which also was wild to me considering how much useless stuff is actually voiced, like Wuk Lamat's 50th speech about peace and understanding cultures. (Its only ever about as deep as enjoying Tacos and food.)  \n\nAnd also obviously they are the main character for this expansion, which is terrible. The player character is useless, and called by other npc's as \"Wuk Lamat's friend' or even ENTOURAGE. They take credit for the things the WoL does. \n\nIt is obvious, that this character is somebody's pet OC, they wanted to shove into the game and outshine the hero of the saga. And they do, to the point I felt entirely not needed. I was not required at all past level 94. \n\nThe pacing of the story is awful, it is riddled with Deus ex Machina to save Wuk Lamat, and put them on a pedestal so they can preach at us about understanding and love. \n\nThere is more to FFXIV than the MSQ though. The combat scenarios, dungeons and job changes are great. \nI applaud the environment and world design.\nSome of the music, especially the disney choir musical one was an absolute miss for me sadly. \n\nI love FFXIV but I loathe Dawntrail's Main Scenario, so I cannot recommend it to others.

This review is about this (entirely single player if you chose to) experience. Not the endgame (that might for all we know be great). Not the dungeons (that are actually better than ever).\n\n3/10\n\nThat is a very tough score to see, especially after the past heights. There are many issues that compound on each other causing the story to be a miserable experience for majority of it. Unfortunately this is the lowest FFXIV has gone. \n\n1. Story\n\nThis unfortunately is the main problem, that also exposes the other issues. If the writing was good all of the other issues would fade away. The story is split into 2 parts (with the second part being shorter, about 70/30 split). Let's split this into 2 parts as well:\n\na. Part I 2/10\n\n[spoiler]The power of friendship and happiness triumphs over all and is the solution to everything.\n\nThis trope, this bloody trope has been in so many teenage aimed anime and japanese games... for decades now. It's a trope that CAN be executed well, but because of its prevalence requires great execution, characters we care about and often subversion of the trope, at least partially. None of that takes place here.\n\nWuk Lamat who is the main character is naive. Believes power of friendship can solve all problems.. This is obviously the case to facilitate character progression. That progression does happen, but in a such boring obvious and predictable way that its a chore to observe.\n\nAlso it is straight up bad writing that Wuk Lamat \"loves her people and her country and their diverse cultures\" but knows NOTHING about them. She learns together with us. She lived her whole life here... How can she say she loves all of he cultures when she KNOWS NOTHNG ABOUT THEM?!?!\n\nThe villains are also uninteresting\n\nBakool Ja Ja is straight up evil for no gain, then releases a flying weapon of mass destruction just to delay his opponents... does things that were specifically pointed out would get you disqualified (and does not get disqualified because the writers forgot I guess)... and then suddenly 180 turn, because his parents are shitty so its okay? No bro. Writers seem partially aware of this and remind us that it was not okay, but the characters all end up being okay with it almost immediately. I am sorry but this redemption arc was RUSHED.. RUSHED in a game that has you spend 2 hours do the most menial things... This is a 10 year old writing a redemption arc. Not once did they show Bakool being remorseless for his actions or hesitant when he was committing them, to hint that he could be redeemed. \n\nAlso us solving the generations old problems in 5 minutes with \"just import different crops\".... I am sorry what. Galuf was here, a man of science. He would have solved this in 5 minutes too. Koana as well... What is this?!?!\n\nZoral Ja: Guy wants to conquer the world, because he wants people to experience war so they would value peace. What.\nHe is like that because everyone had high expectations of him.\nThat's it.\nThis is the same game where we had Emet-Selch. We also had Zenos, but he was entertaining eventually.. This one.... yeah.. just straight up boring.\n\nI feel I have been conned by the interviews - we did not get to hang out with the Scions on the beach sipping drinks and eating tacos. \nWe also completely did not get to compete with the Scions who supported the other candidate. WHY. This was a great opportunity to make the story better without changing it dramatically. You showed us that Koana would probably be a better option in some aspects, why not have his team and him go all the way and compete with us fairly, but seriously. Why can't we come to blows (no killing of course)? Have interesting traps, have Urianger lie about something again. The theme of progressivism vs traditionalism is INTERESTING, RELATABLE.\n\nOh and then we get a random cowboy zone that completely looks out of place. With what feels like filler for 2 hours. Okay. [/spoiler]\n\nb. Part II 6/10\n\n[spoiler]Shdowbringers rehash.\n\nShadowbringers for me was the peak of FFXIV writing. I still cannot believe that the story team publicly said they \"kinda winged it\" with the story until then and pieces just kinda fell into place.. It felt like a master plan.\n\nSo I do not blame the writing team for wanting to reach for that (after probably running out of ideas halfway).\nLet's see. Sphene is basically Emet Selch. Obsessed with protecting/restoring the people of the past, even at the cost of doing harm to people living in the present. Alexandria is from another reflection..... Living Memory evokes the same feeling as Amaurot.... a vision of the past....\n\nSome good emotional moments there, saying good byes to echoes of people that once lived, having to be the one pulling the plug - great. But also once again this is clearly not the same writing team as the original - Erenvile's mom just kinda died offscreen. We never learn how. Maybe the writers forgot that her race is very long lived, and she didn't look old at all....\n\nSphene was a solid villain - I really like the fact that she did not have a change of heart last minute. After all she was just an AI, she rightfully so cannot overcome her programming. It was clear despite her programming it was a struggle for her to do what she had to do.\n\nZoral Ja - 30 years have passed for him. Nothing changed. Snooze.\n\nShout out to Wuk Lamat interrupting the final fight (and with that absolutely horrible voice acting in that moment... HOW DID THIS TAKE MAKE IT TO THE GAME? What was the voice director doing?!)[/spoiler]\n\n2. Voice Acting [ENGLISH] 4/10\n\nWuk Lamat has vast majority of the voice dialogue so we will focus there: She does really good job in most of the chill/mundane dialogue parts, and the happy parts were straight up great. You can really hear the enthusiasm that matches the personality.\nThings fall apart in the negative emotional scenes, sadness is very mediocre. But where things get bad is any kind of action. I don't know if it's the fault of the voice actress or the voice direction but it is just... awful.. And unfortunately those are VERY important parts of the story, even if 80% of the spoken dialogue has great voice acting, it falls apart in those crucial moments.\n\nAll the other characters barely have any voice lines (except [spoiler]Sphene[/spoiler] who did good)... Y'shtola's voice sounds weird, like it was recorded in a completely different location than the rest. The existing cast continues with their good performance, no outstanding moments, but no stinkers either.\n\nBig shout out to the voice actor of Graha'Tia who despite great success since he first voiced the character (he is in Bridgerton , literally a mainstream actor) continues to come back to the role. He also does the best job here (with limited material that he has). Massive respect.\n\nA lot of cutscenes that should have been voiced, were not... but there were also some cutscenes that did not need voice acting at all ended up having it? Was the budget cut in the middle of the production? Not sure who is at fault here but even if budget for VA was limited it could have been used in a better way.\n\n3. Music and Graphics 6/10 and 7/10\n\nFew tracks stick out (field battle theme), rest is alright but not memorable. Graphic update is noticeable and welcome.\nThere is also a jarring vocal track playing during certain happy/victorious moments that sounds like something straight out of Lion King... It was so awful.\n\n4. Gameplay 3/10\n\nSevere lack of gameplay. Very few \"solo instanced\" epic moments. Too many things happen in cutscenes instead of those.\nIt takes 5-6 hours BEFORE YOU GET TO FIGHT ANYTHING. Don't get me wrong - This has been the case in the previous expansions too, but the engaging writing makes those hours fly by.\nIf we looked only at the quality of the gameplay the score would be higher, but I feel like the insane lack of quantity of it has to be given weight.", "timestamp_created": 1720797042, "timestamp_updated": 1720800372, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626765906810760498", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169685216", "author": {"steamid": "76561199646849974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "gameplay of the expansion is amazing, nothing to complain about there, but the story is just unbearable thanks to wuk-lamat. she is annoying and the game is constantly rubbing her into my face, and it doesn\u2019t help that the first half of the story is painfully boring. even in the good scenes later on, i still roll with my eyes as soon as she opens her mouth.\n\nhonestly, if you care about the story just watch a recap on youtube.", "timestamp_created": 1720792938, "timestamp_updated": 1720792938, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553902506828308105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169681849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092583697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to defend this expansion but I just cant. \n\nFFXIV story is one of the main selling points of game.

When I  was playing ARR I was thinking \u201cI want to know how it ends\u201d, in Dawntrail I was thinking \u201cI want it to end\u201d.\n\nMy first major problem with Dawntrail is how bad the story is. After Shadowbringers and Endwalker the difference in quality of the story is extreme. The amount of filler and slow pacing was always a problem in FFXIV but in Dawntrail most of the story feels like a filler.\n\nMy second major problem that I have with Dawntrail is the fact that we as the Warrior of Light are no longer the main character, we are not even a secondary character but a background character that sometimes is mentioned and referred to as just an adventurer. After saving the world(s) multiple times, after SAVING THE UNIVERSE now apparently it is irrelevant like it's World of Warcraft when nothing you did in the story ever matters.\n\nMy third major problem with Dawntrail is the actual main character Wuk Lamat. Innitialy I thought that she was as annoying as Lyse in Stormblood, but I was very wrong. She is much, much more annoying, cringe  worthy, even more incompetent and her voice acting is on the level of ARR.

(Achtung, enth\u00e4lt gewisse Spoiler)\n\nIch habe das Addon DT jetzt durch und ich muss sagen, von der Story her hat es mich halb entt\u00e4uscht.

Jedoch ging es nach der zweiten H\u00e4lfte immer mehr bergab und noch weiter bis unter den Meeresspiegel. Man k\u00f6nnte meinen, ab der zweiten H\u00e4lfte haben sich die Autoren einfach an verschiedenen Quellen bedient, weil sie keine Ahnung mehr hatten, was man noch machen k\u00f6nnte. Gut, die vorige Geschichte ist zu Ende und die war gro\u00df und wurde immer weiter aufgebaut. Ich habe dadurch erwartet, dass die Story nicht so gro\u00dfartig sein wird wie im Vorg\u00e4nger. Jedoch war die zweite H\u00e4lfte einfach nicht gut bis sehr schlecht. Wenn man aufpasst, kann man die Vorlagen der Story-Ideen schnell erkennen, an welchen Ideen sich anscheinend bedient wurde. Um ein paar Beispiele zu nennen, an die ich mich erinnert gef\u00fchlt habe: Terminator, Cyberpunk, Stargate SG1 S07E05: Die Macht des Speichers...\n\nOK, das ist ja nicht mal schlimm, wenn man sich aus anderen Quellen bedient und es logisch in ein Spiel einbringt. Jedoch, was mich am meisten aufgeregt hat, waren die Gr\u00fcnde des/der B\u00f6sewichts/B\u00f6sewichte! Es kann doch nicht sein, dass die Autoren nichts Besseres schreiben konnten, als dass der eine einfach einen Vaterkomplex hat und alles ausl\u00f6schen will, weil Papi ihm in seinen Augen nicht genug Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt hat und aus Trotz Papis \"Spielzeug\" zerst\u00f6ren will!? Und dann eine kleine Prinzessin, die alles t\u00f6ten will, damit sie weiter mit ihren \"P\u00fcppchen\" spielen kann, oder anders gesagt, weiter VR spielen kann. Oh man...

This is a bad expansion, I don't care if the instanced content is good or about the music that I actually really enjoyed, the core experience of the whole game, the MSQ, is awful and there is no other way to say it. \nBy the way, did you know the phrase \"Return to Wuk Lamat\" (or a similar phrase) was the quest objective 139 times? In 100 quests, this phrase was used 139 times. That's 3x the second place, that goes to Lyse in Stormblood.\n\nR e t u r n  T o  W u k  L a m a t\n\nIf there was a Neutral option on Steam for the review, this one would 100% be it.\nThis expansion's MSQ is really lackluster and predictable, here is the resume:\n-> Speak with Wuk Lamat\n-> Speak with 3 NPCs for whatever reason\nWuk Lamat: \"Now I understand X people! Maybe that's why Papa wanted us to do this!!\"\n-> Return to Wuk Lamat\n-> Voiced cutscene that is 10 seconds long\n-> Speak with Wuk Lamat (again, in the exact same spot)\n-> Unvoiced cutscene that is 2 minutes long and could easily be a continuation of the previous voiced cutscene, since it's the exact same conversation, but for some reason it's not.\n\nIf you like this game's combat, the dugeons and trials are alright, fun enough I guess. The classes I've leveled to 100 are meh at best, mostly unchanged classes or \"X skill has an extra charge\". Viper had such an amazing potential, but they tried a \"combo\" system that can interchange with one another, sound cool right? Well, it's not, you basically just press the button that glows and that's that, since it's only 2 buttons that change when pressed (you read it right, Viper combo is only 2 buttons effectively). Don't try to learn the class by reading the tooltips, they are a huge wall of texts with tons of passives/skills names that you have to search which one is it by yourself. Monk has a interchangeable combo system that is fun and actually works. Now, Pictomancer (haven't leveled it yet) looks really fun, skill are beautiful and it has a new Canvas system that is refreshing, tinkered with it a bit and it feels pretty solid.\n\nI wasn't expecting something amazing, it's a whole new story with new characters after all , but this is bad.

I am incredibly disappointed not only by what this game has become, but how out-of-touch the developers seem to be with the actual players.\n\nThis review is focused only on the main scenario of Dawntrail. The combat content has not yet all been released, but I'm hoping that it lives up to the quality of what came in prior expansions. If the combat content is still fun in this expansion, then it is likely that Dawntrail as a whole may still be a worthwhile experience. However, that does not mean I can turn a blind eye to the abysmal visual novel experience that Square Enix is forcing its players to endure.\n\nDawntrail itself narratively sits in an awkward position, because it exists in a space where it needs to fulfill two different objectives. On the one hand, this is a story that is only accessible after hundreds of hours of prior investment. To see Dawntrail, you have to have seen the *entirety* of five separate games' stories. On the other hand, this is a brand-new story that the developers have set out to tell. Most if not all of the plot threads relating to the previous expansions have been wrapped up, and any story worth telling will have to introduce new conflicts and characters. Unfortunately, this expansion failed to deliver what these objectives demanded. The story is not worthwhile enough to justify hundreds of hours of lead-up, and the new conflicts and characters feel empty and shallow.\n\nIt is difficult for me to characterize exactly what went wrong in Dawntrail's story, but my succinct verdict is: the writing is bad. Very often, critics will make mention of \"telling instead of showing,\" but I think Dawntrail goes even further off the cliff. The writers will tell once, tell again, show a brief example, then make sure they tell once more with additional technical details and any other curiosities included. The pacing is so awful, I was sorely tempted to skip cutscenes in this game for the first time in 8 years. Awkward dialogue, stilted exposition, lack of characterization... too many things went wrong for me to point at one specific part and say \"this right here is the problem.\" With a notable exception of Wuk Lamat.\n\nWuk Lamat is the de facto protagonist of this story, and she is an insufferable character. She is introduced as having some character flaws: she rashly rushes into fights and is generally clueless of the culture of her people. At no point, however, are these character flaws resolved. Everything just magically works out for her, in true Mary Sue style. No real conflicts are borne of these flaws, and no conflict forces her to confront her weaknesses. It is generally not a problem that the player character, the Warrior of Light, is no longer the protagonist or even the main focus of the story. However, when the main character that we have to follow around is boring, it starts to grind on you quite a bit.\n\nIt's very obvious as well, from the way the story is written, that whoever created Wuk Lamat was convinced that players would love her. All the dialogue is written with the assumption that we are on Wuk Lamat's team, we like her, we want her to succeed. At no point did the story ever give me any reason to feel these things - it was just assumed that we are totally on board with what is going on, and we have to let it happen.\n\nBut I am not on board with this expansion. Not with the story, not with Wuk Lamat or any other characters, not with the formulaic structure of the story that Square Enix seems so frightened to let go of (1 dungeon every odd level, a trial at level 93, a trial at level 99, a certain number of quests and cutscenes in between each of these things, etc...). To call the story of Dawntrail a \"major disappointment\" would be letting the developers off the hook too easily, I think.\n\nI only hope that the raid series turn out to be better than this initial launch.", "timestamp_created": 1720715459, "timestamp_updated": 1720810026, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536112844944000244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169598091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167083081", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 375073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "**Spoiler free**\nI've been playing this game rather regularly since 2017 (as backed up by my 6200 hours played), and this is the first time I have been this disappointed in a piece of content released for this game.\n\nI have to echo the main concern people are having with this expansion: the story. Look, I get it. This isn't a story exploring nihilism and saving existence as it is like Endwalker. It won't be something that grand and intense. My expectations for some FF14-style intense adventure was LOW. \n\nThat said.. the story was extremely boring. For the same company that reworked a HUGE chunk of their game recently (the ARR expansion) to CUT DOWN boring and monotonous story points and MSQ quests to then go and create again one of the most boring and monotonous MSQ stories is beyond me. \n\n\"FF14 players' brains can't process world building\"\n\"FF14 players don't like reading story text\"\n\"FF14 players can't stand not being the center of attention in the story\"\n\nThe classic \"gotcha\" arguments against any criticism for this expansion content is pretty wild to me. Avoiding spoilers as best I can, the first half of the story (the expansion is literally cut in half) is supposed to help world build with a mid-story 'climax' or payoff that feels so dull. I was hoping that the world building would become a tool for us ... something that would be important to later expansions or push us into the second half of the expansion. That didn't really happen.. you spend 4 hours bartering with a person wearing a duck mask and it doesn't provide anything meaningful besides the power of friendship during that mid-story 'climax'. And I can't really think of how we would move forward with some of the very few characters introduced to us. I thought we'd be forming a sort of new team of adventurers.\n\nThe next half of the expansion is where I (and most people) are more positive. Ignoring the fact that your friends are just randomly with you providing absolutely zero utility and have no reason to be there, the second half gives you mystery and ties in parts from the previous expansions, exploring a current 'plot hole'/looming adventure to be had, and sets up for what could come in the next expansion(s). Great! Love that! It could have been much better if it was more like 75% of the story rather than 40-50%. It felt rushed, squeezed together, and yet still fluffed with boring dialogue. If it had more time to be expanded on, DT truly would have been miles better than what it was.\n\nNow while this is all subjective, I know my opinions on the battle content is a bit controversial as some people find that to be the expansions only saving grace. I really didn't like most of it. The trials were so anticlimactic to me (besides the last one), and partly because I think one of the antagonists was really terribly written (trial 2) and they did not make anybody care about them. But I thought the mechanics were boring and recycled, half the time just adding a flood of visuals that made it difficult not because of the mechanics them-self, but because you can barely tell what is going on on the screen with all the visual bloat. I also find the expert dungeons to be TERRIBLE, everybody dreads going to expert roulette and 8 times out of 10 I just get a group who talks about how much they dislike the dungeons. I miss the fun bunny dungeon and cyber alien dungeon with banger music we got in EW :(\n\nA couple of the MSQ dungeons were bland BUT I did like them for the most part. Pictomancer is maybe one of my favorite jobs they've every created, it is extremely fun and unique.\n\nMoving on from my issues with the battle content (and boring job adjustments), my main point was the MSQ, and it really does not live up to the quality we usually get from SE and FFXIV. Do I think this was lazily made and no thought or care was put into it? Absolutely not. Do I think they made really poor choices and that the risks they took ended up not working at all? Yes, I do. \n\nSE tends to take feedback very seriously and I just pray to the gods that they make changes for the next expansion. I know this was an awkward one to make - kind of a reset in the story after a 10 year story arc. But I had more faith in their abilities. Maybe they are just better at making climactic and grand stories than they are with world building? I do think the patches will improve my feelings on the expansion as whole, as they seem to have some really great content planned.\n\nGet them next time Yoshi P!

In  many ways it feels like the writing has regressed down to what it was in A Realm Reborn days, in addition of introducing entirely new glaring problems. A character who might be otherwise forgivably mediocre or mildly annoying for a side role, with little development, is given center stage for the entire expansion, not only eclipsing the player character but all others as well, when their lacking substance never warranted it. \n\nThe number of times you have real gameplay or activity denied from you to  be instead forced to watch a visual novel from the sidelines is staggering. This is not just an issue of \"who gets to be the main character\", but the fact the player character (along with every other character except the writer's favorite) is denied any agency at all and is reduced to a prop for most of the story. It's especially painful after seeing the previous expansions pioneer so many tricks to make our silent protagonist appear more active in the narrative, this expertise now apparently forgotten. \n\nThe dungeon boss designs have markedly improved from Endwalker, but unfortunately the design of the classes/jobs overall has stagnated at best, even several previous golden boys of the game such as Dragoon and Black Mage now either losing their identity or having their flexibility and skill expression removed in favor of frustratingly rigid gameplay. Meanwhile entire roles such as healers and tanks play so similarly to each other you might as well not have multiple jobs within them, except for an aesthetic choice. The new job, Viper, however is a breath of fresh air (and apparently Pictomancer as well, though I can't vouch for it personally yet). \n\nThe overworld zones are beautiful, and form a far more cohesive corner of the world than in the previous couple expansions, aided strongly by the strong American (mostly southern) theme of the expansion.

It is very experimental in how it's handling itself, both in terms of progression and story.\n\nThe dungeons and trials are some of the best in the game's history, truly top tier work. The gear options for glamour are also some of the best I've seen from a variety standpoint.\n\nHowever I feel the expac is filled with filler cutscenes where a quest has a fade to black and changes to a scene where everyone does 1 or 2 emotes, makes an angry/sad/happy/etc. face at each other, and scenes are randomly voiced for no reason and major scenes that should have voice seem to not have it. This is artificially stretching out an expac that should be 12 to 14 hours long to be almost the same length as end walker, there are that many cutscenes. You will see \"Talking to BLANK will cause several custscenes to play in sequence. Please set aside ample time to view them.\" A warning that for all other expacs was only seen right before major story moments, or huge story climaxes, yet here it's like every 6 quests it pops up.\n\nMy biggest complaint is a lot of cutscenes should've been solo duties, but aren't. Without getting into spoilers, such instances that come to mind for those that play are when the group is in pursuit of a certain individual during the first half of the expac, or things that take place ontop of something during the 2nd half, or an area that should've been a solo instance during a certain point in the story but isn't, ruining the feeling they're going for because every city has someone running around in a joke costume, killing the immersion. \n\nOverall I am enjoying my time with Dawntrail, it's a fun relief from the story heavy moments of the last two expansions, but it's def an expac you feel like you have to force yourself to trudge through at times.", "timestamp_created": 1720650775, "timestamp_updated": 1720658260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527410209178924561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169543054", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991833571", "num_games_owned": 866, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 365335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 271, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Content good, story bad\n\nThe new zones, dungeons, trials, two new classes and duties are all very enjoyable. But what really divides people is the story, some say the lvl 90-95 portion is very boring, some say the lvl 95-100 drops the ball. I'm in the former, while I started to enjoy it more later on it was still a very unremarkable story. \n\nThe main problem is the writers exchange your established companions to refocus onto two, in my opinion, unlikeable ones - Wuk Lamat and Erenville. While Erenville was present as a decent side character in Endwalker, he's been turned into an insufferable main character here. Wuk Lamat - a boring, tiring new character whos entire personality boils down to naive goody goody heir to the throne, where the game forces you to be her cheerleader throughout, even so far as to force you into dialogue options as if you are best buddies. It's not earnt at all. Not to mention the English VA is not the greatest performance when compared to the others. The only slim saving grace is we get to know about Krile more.\n\nThe other issue I found is from levels 90-95, there is no actual antagonist. You're stuck trying to win the \"Rite of Succession\" for Wuk Lamat, which involves going around learning about the different sub-cultures of the new land. While great for world building, it is a chore and a bore for people waiting for something to happen.

The English voice acting is the worst it has ever been since ARR. This new character is pushed so hard onto the player and she is just the absolute worst. Completely entitled woman-child that thinks she should be queen because she is nice.\n\nIn early expansions you had main characters in expansions that had diverse opinions and mature feelings. You had different people with interesting and compelling reasons for making the choices that they make. In this expansion? You have childish, high school level drama like an antagonist stepping on tacos and that is a plot point. There were light-hearted characters in the past, but never has the main character of an expansion been so unlikable and still get so much screen time. Lyse is a step up from Wuk Lamat and Lyse is a low bar to clear.\n\nThey also ruined Black Mage with this expansion. They removed Ice Paradox, they removed gaining MP while in Ice phase because a dev get their feelings hurt that players weren't being controlled to play exactly how these fragile devs demand people to play.

Wuk Lamat was a fun character, until she wasn't. Way, way too much of her. Erenville was at least left with some screen time, but poor Krile was completely shafted (and I thought her stuff turned out to be the most interesting).\nWhat? Oh, there were other party members too? Could have fooled me. As an example: the great diplomat and politician. Smartypants. Child prodigy. Blue Alphinaud has absolutely no advice for Wuk. Wuk IS who blue Alphinaud was in ARR, and yet he has not a single word of caution or anything (yes there is one mumbled line about naivety, but which he does not share with her). Instead, he just says his catch phrase about collecting firewood and something about Garlemald.\nFor how much talking there is in the expansion, the characters are way under utilized.\n\nGameplay:\nBattle content is good, keeps everyone on their toes. I have a feeling some of it may be a touch too hard for some of the more casual players. There's dungeon bosses where I always see at least one DPS constantly dead, despite just being topped off and shielded, and the tank with like 4 vulnerability stacks.\nSpeaking of which, I still dislike how the healer is essentially punished for the other players' mess ups. You already need to heal the damage they took and extra shield them, is the vulnerability stack really needed? Couldn't there be a way to punish the player who's actually failing the mechanic? Funnily enough there actually is, in one of the level 100 dungeons, but nowhere else.\nAnd the larger job changes just seem baffling, but it's hard to judge them yet.\n\nOVERALL, it's not like I absolutely hate it, I'm gonna play until my sub runs out and have a fun time.

Back when this game still made me glad and not sad because this shit is now made for people who play with only one hand.\n\nThe story was so bad i almost fell asleep, the writing so bad it's not at all deep. Having my time wasted is not what i seek. It  seems so very cheap, when i was expecting the quality to take a big leap. I will not weep because the developers can't keep their promise not to repeat.\n\nI only read about half of the story but then i started skipping it since was so boring. if the writers are not willing to respect my time as the reader than i see no reason to respect their work. No spoilers, but nothing happens in this, absolutely nothing at all, that's not a joke that's not my opinion, that's the truth. The entire story is that you follow this furry woman named Wuk lamat around and beat up all of her enemies and that's pretty much it. Also in the english dub Wuk lamat is voiced by a man (that's not a joke) I will say no more regarding this exept that Final Fantasty 14 is now woke and cringe, and that is something a real alpha beta omega male gamer such as myself could never enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay this time is worse than ever before, all of the problems that i have complained about for years are still here, The oversimplification of the jobs, healer only having one attack, the non existent difficulty of 90 percent of the games content, etc. I will use the monk as an example, back in shadowbringers this job had almost endless complexity, an almost infinite skill ceiling, multiple systems that interact with each other to create the most fun job in an mmo ever. well in Endwalker they removed most of what made it fun and interesting, no more skills that required you to stand on a specific position relative to the boss, and no more stances. i was very disappointed at the time, i still am. But in Dawntrail, they even removed the buff and the debuff that monk needed keep up at all times and replaced it with a combat system where the next attack you need to use lights up bright yellow, no thinking required. \"But they gave us a new useless button to press once every minute so it's okay\". No it's not. The job plays itself now, how is that fun. Why did they change it you may ask. Because some people who don't play the job and are not interested in learning it complained that it was too difficult. Now nobody enjoys playing it. same thing with kaiten, people complained, it got removed now nobody wants to play samurai, same thing. these toxic casual players always gotta ruin the fun. In many interviews prior to the release of Dawntrail the producer said that the diffculty of normal mode dungeons will be increased. It is true but not by that much, once you have played them and understand how it works, it's just as easy as in the previous expansion. especially since we now have very overpowered defence skills on the tanks. So the gameplay is just the same shit again, i am disappointed but not surprised. So what content is available to play in the game right now, 3 level 100 dungeons and two extreme fights. there is almost no content in the game to play right now, so that kinda sucks too, but that's nothing new. they delay the release of most of it to keep people subscribed for a long time, how nice of them.\n\nI could write more about this game but i just don't care. I don't think i will play this game ever again. Dawntrail was the last chance i was willing to give to this game, i was hoping that this time it would maybe be diffrent but unfortunately not. But back when this game was good it was very fun, i will not forget the memories i have from playing the game at that time and that is big reason for why i no longer enjoy how the game is today, and why i write this shit, because the game was so much better before. Before Endwalker that is. If the game is not fun then why bother.\n\nDawntrail has been quite possibly the worst video game expansion i have ever played and even if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series you will probably not find much, if any enjoyment in this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1720626971, "timestamp_updated": 1720626971, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437259972095489502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169507197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032611059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "below mid story, writing, acting, even more homogenization and simplification of jobs.

While previous expansions have taken us on an emotional rollercoaster, the only emotions I felt here were boredom and annoyance. \nI don't mind our WoL taking a step back and acting more as a mentor or simple adventurer, instead of being the main focus. It's an interesting concept that you can do a lot with. However, the way it was handled in Dawntrail was utterly unenjoyable. Even if the PC is not intended to be the main focus, you have to keep in mind that this is still a game, and you need to give the player something to do. Just having us standing around, or doing only fetch quests, while another character gets to do all the interesting things, simply does not work. That, coupled with the insane amount of unvoiced cutscenes this time around, turns the expansion into more of a visual novel than a game. And not a very good one. \nI'm a big fan of world building, but the tell-don't-show approach they used here is really the worst way to do it.\n\nPersonally I found the story completely uninspired, and our reason for being there nonsensical.[spoiler] The second part of the MSQ felt like a budget version of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, without any understanding of what made those expansions such outstanding experiences.[/spoiler] \n\nThe biggest problem the MSQ has is the new main character, Wuk Lamat. While I was quite neutral towards her when she was introduced in the last patch, and also at the beginning of the MSQ, I quickly started disliking her as the story progressed. \nHer naivet\u00e9, the repeated jokes about her sea sickness, the constant \"happiness and peace\", the lack of any believable character development for her, coupled with very poor voice acting just make her into an insufferable character. Her complete cluelessness about her own country and people made her taking part in the rite of succession feel like a bad joke. There's \"unqualified to be a ruler\", and then there's whatever this is. The fact everyone's constantly cheering her on and no one every challenges her motivation, values or believes in any way, does not help either.\n[spoiler]I think I would have been fine with her character had they limited her presence to the first half of the MSQ. However, things only got worse in the second half, and she started hogging even more screen time. Even when there were important story developements that concerend other charcters in the group - instead of focusing on those characters, namely Erenville and Krile, the focus switched right back to Wuk Lamat, and completely ignored how the other characters were personally impacted by what just happened.[/spoiler] \nGenerally, she is like a black hole, that attaches itself to everything, and sucks up any enjoyment, fun and character development.

I will say though, the voice acting from the new characters is this expansion's saving grace (yes, even Wuk Lamat's voice actress did pretty great given what she had to work with).\n\nI had mixed feelings with the music choices. Previous expansions had absolute bangers, but half of the new ones feel really out of place and completely goofy at times (one track reminded me of Toy Story, you can't unhear it). I can forgive the over-world/town tracks, but there are certain cut-scenes that had these motivational songs that warped me back to those corny Lifetime shows, and cursed Disney direct-to-video sequels that made me feel second-hand embarrassment. I don't know what possessed them to go with it, but maybe they wanted a Hercules moment. I was NOT impressed. \n\nIf you're a healer and hoped this would be the expansion to change up your 1 button mashing idle clicker gameplay, then you're out of luck buddy. We're still one-button dps bots during down times since we got even MORE ridiculous ways to heal, while giving tanks another way to self-heal. Goodie. We did get 1 extra dps every 180 seconds out of pity from SE, but it was so negligible since it barely changed up 90% of my game-play. Oh, and Astrologian is still facing an identity crisis if you're sick of reworks, btw. \n\nExpansion releases are mainly focused on story and leveling, so you'll have to wait for more mid-core content throughout future patches. The main one to look for is the exploration content that probably won't be released for months. \nAlliance raids won't be released until 7.1, so if you want the best bang for your buck as a casual player, then I suggest holding off on subbing until 7.1 or the new exploration zones come out. \n\n\nPositives:\n\nGraphical improvements are very nice, your characters are more attractive and the environments are much more detailed in the new areas. The lighting isn't as horrible, and that washed-out look the game originally had is less noticeable.\n\nNew jobs are genuinely fun and a lot more interesting this time around. I personally decided to main both of these jobs. Pictomancer particularly feels really satisfying when you're able to line up your big damage number abilities and skills properly. Viper is a level above Gunbreakers and Reapers in terms of busy gameplay, so they feel lightning fast if you like that combat style. Both of them are also pretty fun in PVP. \n\nThe new dungeon and trial mechanics are fresh and interesting.

I think the Hydaelyn/Zodiark saga, particularly when it became center stage at the start of Shadowbringers and finished in Endwalker, was one of the best stories ever told in gaming. Not just in XIV or the FF series as a whole. But gaming overall. Yes it had flaws, yes it also had filler quests but the good far far faaar outweighed the bad imo. Shadowbringers specifically in the finale of 5.0, and 5.3 gave us some of the best moments the FF series has ever had. And Endwalker had some of the most satisfying character moments, along with the 6.0 finale being the best wrap up to a 10 year saga the writers could have possibly given us. Again, they weren't perfect. But they were extremely extremely good. \n\n In comparison, Dawntrail is a mess of a fucking meandering adventure. The story is stapled together by what feels very much like side quests pretending to be main quests, with little beats of just *ok* character moments sprinkled in to keep you on copium long enough to be disappointed by another chain of quests that feel like nothing else but filler. Every single zone in the expansion has got a handful of narrative problems everywhere and they just compound on each other so much over the course of the story that it's kind of become shocking to me that they thought THIS was a good enough followup to their last arc, and a decent start for their next. \n\n Dawntrails story isn't bad per say. It could have been worse. But considering that XIV is known largely for its story, a story that has been praised to high heaven by us fans and critics alike, and that its advertised as a *story driven mmorpg*, it is a huuuge disappointment for us fans who know this team can do much better. It's like going to your favorite 5 star restaurant, ordering a brand new dish that they have, naturally expecting another 5 star meal or at least 4 stars, and being given a crusty two star meal that's somewhat cold, with some moldy ass looking bread on the side. This is not a good start to their next 10 year arc. We went from having some of the strongest stories in games to just being given a big ollle giant pile of *meh*.\n\n Wuk Lamat is a decent character but its kind of goofy to me that they went so hard on her that basically if you end up not liking her, which there is a good chance you wont because of how cliche she can be, then the entire expansion is gonna fall flat on its face. And I just do not understand why the writers put soooo many of their eggs in this one basket, which is the Wuk Lamat basket. Especially considering she is a character that we JUST met in 6.55, which was a half patch. She wasn't even given a full patch to be introduced before not only us, but the rest of the cast that we've come to love over the years were shoved to the side for her. So she can go on this padded adventure, and learn basic gradeschool life lessons like \"its ok to share your emotions with others\" and \"power of friendship!\" which is stuff that XIV has already given us in the past expansions that didn't feel nearly as hammered in.\n\n There's plenty of other story things besides how they handle Wuk Lamat that freakin disappoint me but this review would be twice as long if I went into them. But all in all, this is just...not it. Yoshi P and his team gave us gold in their past expansions with the sole exclusion being Stormblood, but even Stormblood was at least more consistent and less padded than Dawntrail as far as I remember. I'm gonna hold out hope that Yoshi and team pivot their writing plans in the 7.X patches based off of how mixed this story is and recover from it but as of right now, in 7.0. This is a pretty giant disappointment. The story has done something that I haven't really felt since the ARR patches, which is bore the heck out of me.

I personally started playing at the launch of Heavensward which I adored, and I enjoyed Stormblood, and at this point I refuse to lower my standards and just swallow the pill: \"it's supposed to be like this, it's a new start\". People seem to forget that good storytelling does not mean sad and depressing. It can be fun, it can be relaxing and can be happy and moving and of course it can be slow. It just has to be GOOD! The WoL has been too much in the background this time around, and while I would be satisfied with us having less responsibilities, I would like to be able to hang out with our Scion friends, I've missed them and after finishing the MSQ I still miss them. I don't want new friends to go to adventures with, I want the friends I already have went through all these difficulties with, that were right beside me to the very end of existence. \n\nBefore diving into the story I want to just say that apart from the story everything else is great! Soken has once again delivered with amazing pieces, bangers and emotional ones. The team that's responsible for areas and culture research has done a stellar job. I loved all the connections with Peruvian and other Latin American cultures. All areas look amazing and the over all graphics' update as well as other QoL updates have been spot on. And gameplay and new boss mechanics are refreshing, especially that spooky dungeon.  Yet, for a game that its primary sell point is its story I would not recommend Dawntrail, but I hope they pick up this disaster of an MSQ and fix it during the patches. \n\n[b]SPOILER AREA[/b]\n\nNow the common problem most people have is that Wuk Lamat is stuck on WoLs throat, and many people before me have stated the obvious problems with the character so I will try to not reiterate the rest of the reviews. It is not good storytelling to have ONLY ONE character move the entire story. I kept on feeling that I was being pulled and pushed around by a child I was for some reason given to babysit. And after meeting characters like Emet-Selch, Venat, Hythlodaeus, Ryne, Lyna, damn even Dulia-Chai, Wuk Lamat just fails to make me care for her. Is she a happy character? Yes. Does she have depth? No. Is she funny? Hell no. Returning to one of my primary points, good storytelling can be funny. Seriously who thought that making hunger and clumsiness jokes is good? Is she Luffy?? Well at least she became Hokage...\n\nThe other 3 claimants are also extremely lacking. Koana was the most interesting, but we've got Bakool Ja Ja releasing a natural disaster beast on to the world and he gets away with it because he's emotional??? WHAT??? Did they think that the players are stupid? Zoraal Ja was just a plot device to get to the rest of the game. The reasons behind his ideals are not being touched upon (honestly at that point it felt like the writers had very low emotional maturity and emotional intelligence). You have poor Krile tell the player that Zoraal Ja is big-bad-guy. I don't want you to tell me, SHOW ME. Having a character say that another character is bad is just lazy writing. Finally, Sphene, I have no problem with Sphene, I believe she needed more screen time. \n\n[b]ULTRA BIG SPOILER AREA[/b]\n\nThe last area of the game and the story telling at the last few quests was actually much much better, but let's see why. Putting big concepts about death and life, memories, souls and Azem aside that were very very interesting and engaging (finally). It was engaging because all the characters in our group spoke. We finally had a stroll with Raha, saw Krile's and Erenville's softer and more vulnerable side and the ongoing theme about family this expansion often discusses got a pay off here. I cried with both of them and I'm glad I got to experience those moments. But why did I not cry with Wuk Lamat's parents? Maybe because there was no emotional build up for those moments, compared to Krile and Erenville. I do not understand how that can happen when the same group of people write the same story. Maybe it's because when she met her biological father who gave her away to protect her she just \"brushed it off\". \n\nLastly, what has left me disappointed is that there is clear connection to the WoL/Azem with the Sun, the logo of the expansion has a circle at the top reminiscent of the Azem symbol, we're all about the sun this the sun that, but the only thing we finally get about ourselves is just that that artifact is probably Azem's?

The new classes are great, and the Dark Knight buff was very appreciated. But this story is just not it chief. I know that after the last expansion we kind of Finished the main arc, and by extension our Character arc. It was a MASSIVE Crescendo to end it all. It was called ENDWALKER for Gods sake. It Should have ended there. The only reason this expansion exists is because WoW crashed and burned and People flocked to 14 during Shadowbringers and it made more Money then God. Endwalker was a fantastic ending to it all, post Endwalker... I have notes, mainly the Y'shtola character assassination but I digress. \n\nMy major issue is Why are we here? We Literally have NO reason to be here except the new writer's OC dragged us out her for Some reason. It's way to disconnected to the point of it being Jarring. The new Hub Town is annoying to Navigate, And these Dungeon Mechanics are Borderline Masochistic. I know Shadowbringers and Endwalkers Dungeons where boring, but this is getting ridiculous just to manage half of the positioning of the fight. I know it's high level content, but I'm not having fun rouletting with a bunch of randos to do Savage level mechanics to continue the plot!

I have played each and every expansion the day they released and have completed all stories without skipping, and I can confidently say this is the weakest story thus far. \n\nThe story is not good, and has nothing to do with being a \"starting point for a new story.\" It's also NOT due to not being the main character of this story. 99% of players would throw money at their screen to be a side character in a story about Zenos, Emet-Selch, or even Y'shtola. Wuk Lamat is just not well written (as a lot of other elements in this story are not) - no character development, her attitude and mannerisms are borderline childish, and good GRIEF her english VA is so bad. Enough with the wall of text, you'll get more than enough of that in the expansion.\n\nThe good:\nCombat systems - The fights are great and the mechanics are really fun. The dungeons and trials truly shine and the duty team is really letting it fly with these fights.\nViper and Pictomancer - Both good classes with a lot of hype and fun elements. (Please Yoshi-P don't dumb down Viper too much)\nArt - Everything looks good. Not much more I can really say here. \n\nThe bad: \nMSQ Design - The main story quests design is starting to show its age. \"Talk to Wuk Lamat\" is like 80% of the quests and I wish I was kidding. This then kicks off lengthy cutscenes. We need more agency on the story or at least more engagement.\nMain Story Writing - The pacing is all over the place. For the first time in my 2500+ hours I skipped cutscenes in this expansion during a certain cooking quest because it would not stop and I was half falling asleep. It's just not good this time unfortunately.\n\nThe ugly: \nEnglish Voice Acting - Whoever decided Wuk Lamat's voice actor was fine should have their position in the company re-evaluated. It is not good by any stretch and I was forced swapped to Japanese. I would way rather listen to Minfilia and my OGs know how bad that got at times. \nCutscenes - Why are some voiced and other CRUCIAL moments not voiced? Don't get me wrong, the parts with Wuk Lamat I was fine not being voiced but there's a lot of very important story beats that are just silent and are just text. Something happened with voice acting and I'm not sure what, but it is for the worse.\n\nSquare Enix, Yoshi-P, and CBU3 need to do better.", "timestamp_created": 1720482982, "timestamp_updated": 1720482982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517236173152923584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169370709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025301084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "As a longtime FFXIV fan, I hate to admit it, but this expansion has some serious problems.\n\n[h3]First, the good:[/h3]\nDawntrail\u2019s combat is a massive improvement! Dungeons, trials, and the vanishingly few MSQ solo duties (we\u2019ll get there) have all been phenomenal, with much more action and involvement than previous expansions. Additionally, the consequences for failing a combat mechanic are harsher, which makes playing correctly feel important for the first time in a long while.\n\nThe setting is phenomenal. Each zone is beautiful, expansive, and interesting! The lore is also fascinating and leaves plenty of starting points for new stories, both big and small. The graphics update brings the game forward a solid 5 or 6 years in terms of fidelity, and the music is technically well-executed (if a little out of place). Finally, all of the non-combat content, like crafting, gathering, and fishing are still fantastic, as usual.\n\nEDIT: Finally, before I start ragging on the story, I should say that the \"bones\" of the story had great potential. The themes of compassion, culture, understanding, and duty could have been fantastic, and the various foils to Wuk's naivety could have been fascinating. If the writers had handled this better, I have no doubt it would have been amazing!\n\n[h3]Now, the bad:[/h3]\nFFXIV is primarily sold and marketed as being \u201cthe one MMO with a good story,\u201d and up until now, it succeeded spectacularly at that. There were occasional dips in quality, but from start to finish the characters were consistent and compelling, and the plot moved forward with an understandable logic. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case (bear with me, please).\n\nThe story in Dawntrail had great potential from its premise. The player, a famous adventurer who has saved multiple worlds at this point, is in desperate need of a vacation along with their friends, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Conveniently, a new character has shown up, Wuk Lamat, and she needs help to win the throne of her homeland, Tuliyollal. This sets up the player as a mentor and occasional helping hand in Wuk\u2019s journey across the tropical lands of Tural, giving them and the Scions the low-stakes vacation they\u2019ve been hoping for. For some added drama, a few of the Scions have chosen to help Wuk\u2019s brother, Koana, win the throne instead, setting the player up to occasionally fight against their own best friends down the road. Excitement!\n\nThis premise has everything players wanted: lower stakes, a tropical vacation, and some safe drama. Sadly, this is not what actually happens. Instead, Dawntrail is 90% cutscenes and dialogue about how cool Wuk Lamat is. And I say this as someone who likes her! Her character was part of that strong premise I outlined, and I was looking forward to seeing more of her, just not nothing but her.\n\nWhile the player does superficially take on the role of mentor to Wuk Lamat, this never amounts to anything. Instead, Wuk goes on her journey to win the throne largely alone, and the player stands in the background. They never train her, nor do they offer any of their adventuring expertise. Any time a decision needs to be made, a new character walks on screen to outline what Wuk needs to do. The player helps with menial tasks by clicking on things occasionally, but the story would not change if they disappeared. The same can be said for the Scions.\n\nOn that note, any character from a previous expansion has lost their personality and mannerisms in Dawntrail. Every non-Wuk Lamat character is the same person with the same voice. They all react to things in the same way, and very rarely give personal input based on their prior experiences in the story (barring one great cutscene near the end with G\u2019raha). And Wuk Lamat doesn\u2019t benefit from this deficiency at all; her character stays the same from start to finish, with the only thing changing being her confidence in how cool she is.\n\nHalfway through the story, a natural stopping point for Wuk\u2019s journey presents itself, and most players would assume that other characters (for example, the two characters advertised as having a big story in this expansion, Krile and Erenville), would finally have time to be in cutscenes and say things. This is not the case. After the big turn in the plot, Wuk volunteers to lead the group into the new development, and everyone placidly nods and follows her out of the room, with Krile and Erenville remaining silent and largely absent. The rest of the story plays out the same way as above, with Wuk doing everything by herself with the help of random characters appearing from off-screen to explain things. And again, I like her! I like Wuk Lamat! This is a writing problem, not a character problem.\n\nI think this problem is best exemplified by the final fight (no spoilers). This fight is meant to make sure the player has one shining moment to show off the strength and resolve they\u2019ve developed over their illustrious career of saving worlds, after giving Wuk Lamat her own heroic journey the rest of the time. At least, that\u2019s what you would expect. But no, Wuk Lamat literally breaks through space and time to jump in front of us and beat the final boss by herself. She then leads the heroes back home while an off-brand Disney high school song plays. Final reminder, I like Wuk Lamat.\n\nWhile the hyperfocus on a single character is the main problem with the story, there are other issues that can\u2019t be ignored. The plot has several severe holes that are never addressed, and multiple climactic moments are cut short by unexpected anticlimaxes. A few battles happen either off-screen or in cutscenes, where in previous expansions these fights would have made for interesting solo duties. Considering the massive improvement in fight design, this absence of content is particularly painful. Also, remember the \u201clow stakes vacation with safe drama\u201d I mentioned earlier? None of that happens. The universe is threatened yet again, we never sip a margarita or hit the beach, and we never have any conflict with our friends, safe or otherwise. None of the advertised points deliver.\n\nFinally, the pacing is especially glacial, even for FFXIV. Every step of the story is punctuated by having to talk to multiple random, nameless NPCs, who provide no relevant information. A cutscene then plays where the characters discuss back and forth the fact that they have no new information. A new character then runs in and provides the one piece of information they were missing, kicking off the next round of talking to random, nameless NPCs. This cycle repeats for about 40 hours straight. In previous expansions, those slow moments at least felt productive for the plot and characters. In Dawntrail, it\u2019s nothing but killing time.\n\nStory isn\u2019t the only problem this expansion has, unfortunately. The English localization is markedly worse than previous expansions, excluding ARR. Characters have voices that don\u2019t match, dialogue has factual errors (no Wuk, the giants aren\u2019t from Kozama\u2019uka, they\u2019re from Urqopacha. Get it together!), and many voice lines are either poorly mixed or bad takes. Whoever CBU3 had approving voice lines for the English performances needs to be reprimanded. Characters mispronounce words, \u201cpretend-shout\u201d when they should be shouting, and just plain sound bored. If the characters are bored, imagine how the player feels!\n\n[h3]Wrapping up:[/h3]\nIn conclusion, most elements of the game are improved in Dawntrail, but the biggest failure of the expansion happens to be its most important. When you advertise yourself as having an emotional story and compelling characters, providing neither is a major misstep. Will I keep playing? Absolutely.

I am piling on another negative review while it's still mixed because it feels less pointless right now while people are divided.\n\nFirst I wanna say that the new zones/areas, environments etc are really nice to look at and well done.  The dungeons and trials have been fun and they brought some fresh gameplay for the players (when they can actually get to it). \n\nBut the story is just so bad it's impossible to just pretend like you weren't just served sewage in a glass and told 'drink up'. I understand players should expect a more relaxed, lower-stakes story after a big story concludes that that doesn't mean they should be served steaming hot garbage made with 0 effort.\n\n[h3] Part 1 [/h3]  \nThe pacing and MSQ slog of the first half felt like tedious filler where you: move around to different areas on the map > waste your time reading tons of dialogue that doesn't mean anything significant > be delivered the same overall message of the story again (but this time the society is wearing different clothes than the last one so somehow that makes it more meaningful), and repeat.  It's a reskin of Stormblood's Gyr Abania half of the xpac (except now you have Wuk Lamat instead of Lyse) but at least the zones are prettier and has nicer scenery than STB).\n\nI was excited to put that behind and move on to the second half until the next plot actually kicks off.  This is where it becomes the worst writing in history\u2014the first half was barely a story so its sins were more forgivable.  You can tell the zone/city ideas were designed first and then the plot cohesion was just throwing darts on a wall to find ways to somehow make them cohesive.\n\n[h3] Part 2 [/h3] \nIt is apparent from the get-go that the producers were not exaggerating when they said they're going to avoid making things dark/serious from now on; the plot is a ZERO STAKES plot.  The game storyboard relies on the player to have their hand held and spoonfed the narrative, and completely hinges on half-ass attempts to make players emotional with emotional scenes (likely attempting to recreate some of the success of Endwalker since it was well-received) but...Apparently couldn't be bothered to actually MAKE things emotional - either due to laziness or because the idea of making things dark is somehow much scarier to them than serving the players steamed garbage on a plate, I'm not sure. \n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nTheir systematic method of 'keeping things light but make it emotional' was as follows:  \n[spoiler]Introduce new character > barely give them screen time > sad music plays as the obvious thing happens that was death-coded from day one.[/spoiler]  Like, they were so resistant to making the story have anything dark in it that they inserted so many bs loopholes to circumvent any stakes or hard decisions. Their way of 'fixing' any plot stakes or possible moral ambiguity was [spoiler] Dawnservant?  He was already dying anyway which is why the succession plot was even happening.  The antagonists army?  Well, you don't need to feel bad about people cutting them down because they're just robot soldiers and not people.  The Endless?  Yeah, they're AI so they're not alive so you don't have to feel bad about it...Same with Sphene.  Not to mention the game in that whole last zone has Endless npc chars pop up just to inorganically reiterate to the player that \"we're actually okay with dying, we encourage this.  This is the only option\" in a way that you can just tell they really felt the need to baby the player to make sure the player doesn't try to think any deeper on any of this...[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h3] How [b]every single aspect of the plot[/b] was lazy COPY AND PASTE FROM PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS: (SEE LIST) [/h3] \n\nAnd the biggest crime of all was the second half's complete rehash of story themes that have ALREADY BEEN USED in other xpac MSQ's.  I can't think of a single novel theme/arc in this one that wasn't just reusing an old one but being 10x lazier and making it 10x worse.  For example: \n\n[spoiler] - The last zone is a bad rehash of Amaurot/The Ancients storyline. To quote a friend, \"echoes of a long destroyed civilization being propped up by a single authority figure who can't let go of the past\" [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] -  Along with the poor rehashing of Amaurot's plot theme, the whole 'goodbye to Endless npc after emotional scene as they die' is a direct bad rehash of Endwalker's Ultima Thule...Because this time they are characters we barely know and just met and, again, they are not alive, remember? (: [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] - Sphene being a rehash of Meteion, making a cute/youthful/sweet girl end up being the big bad, same sort of internal turmoil throughout the arc, making the same pained \"I don't wanna do this\" faces to tell the player they're a good person and that you're supposed to like them etc etc.  Lots of similar forced narrative overlap. And they still did Meteion better...[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] - Most of the AI / tech themes were already explored in Omega raid series (and Omega sidequests), which was also written better.  Remember Omega and the Omicrons with the whole \"we're no longer human, just memories so don't feel bad about killing us\"[/spoiler]\n\n\nDespite how bad the story was, I was actually enjoying the last trial until [spoiler]that mid-trial cutscene/event, and you KNOW the one I'm talking about.  Ruined the moment hard.[/spoiler]\n\nTLDR; I'd rather play ARR and STB back to back than ever touch this story again, the last half felt like physical torture to go on. Shadowbringers was truly the writing peak of the series.  Wuk Lamat is so forced into every part of the story and dialogue it's absurd.  Also they nerfed Thancred's eyebrows in DT.  Square really fumbled and hopefully enough of the playerbase has the media literacy to not just give a pass.

EW wrapped up our story nicely as far as I'm concerned.\n\nVoice acting is good from the usual players but the new voices are hit or miss. Wuk Lamat and Cahciua are two notably terrible ones that had me wanting to switch languages half way through. If you can't read a line properly they shouldn't let you in the sound booth. Really pulled me out of the moment from time to time. \n\nThe dungeons are great, the trials are fun and filled with new mechanics to trip you up once or twice.\nMost of the music is great (end song is rubbish) and the new graphics upgrade is welcome.\n\nStory has a serious problem with tone in places. Characters being happy when me and gf were wondering why they weren't sad like us, happy music in sad places, sad music in happy places, just inconsistencies that your subconscious will notice even if you don't. Entire final zone is a prime example IMO.\n\nSlight spoilers maybe: [spoiler] I don't mind the fact that Wuk Lamat is the main character this xpac. After EW wrapped up 10 years of story for me it's a nice change of pace. And if you want 10 more years of great story then you need a good fresh base to launch it from with new friends / enemies etc. \n\nProblem is they only made us a body guard and servant of Wuk Lamat. She didn't learn anything from us because Wuk was perfect from the start. They already loved helping people, they already had a heart of gold, they were already amazing they just needed muscle for the competition and to beat up her brothers. I realized at one point I felt more like Alfred than Batman during the MSQ. [/spoiler]\n\nMajor story spoilers: [spoiler] The final zone feels like a total screw up on the writers part. The entire fight with Sphene felt forced and the murder of her Endless citizens needlessly cold. Here we are, in a new reflection with access to the last leader from it and the entire thing is squandered. All the history and knowledge destroyed by shutting down their terminals.  Know what could have saved the Endless and Sphene? A simple trade contract for animals etc with any of the nations, how many souls could she possibly need? Her Endless city was already running low, she wouldn't have the military might to take on everyone we can muster. Did she not pay attention when we killed the King?

The Writing will even make \"references\" to how similar they are to other cultures we already know...\n\nThe writing is also so beyond predictable its horrendous. The moment any problem pops up some character will instantly show up with the solution. Non spoilery example: \"We need to track this big beast, how will we track it at its high speed and multiple elemental typings.\" character pulls out a cartoon hand that can track a specific element. Player proceeds to use hand to track ONLY ONE TYPE. After no luck, \"hmm, maybe it cant track due to the multiple elements\" Beast proceeds to let out a scream nearby and player goes to fight it...like...really.\n\nThe worst thing of all is the villains which are also just comparable to A Realm Reborn, or even (and i hate to say it) WOW SHADOWLANDS. Your shown one villain, but that villain gets redeemed (very well i will add its a good part), but then the guy that's \"totally not the twist villain\" becomes the main villain, and then there's a character you think will be an ally (just like Thancred in arr) but nope, becomes the main final villain that actually orchestrated the main conflict.\n\nI was willing to give this writer a shot, but this is beyond bad to the point I'm not willing to give her one.\n\nEverything else is sub par, the new zones are again very comparable to previous zones (hell 3 are basically the same agriculturally) The Music is mostly fantastic as well as the dungeons and the 2 main towns. But there are also some out of nowhere high school musical track that feels so out of place it ruins the emotion its trying to portray. \n\nIn the end, this expansion just feels like filler. Nothing serious or gamechanging happened besides the possibilities left in mystery at the end which is okay...but that's what endwalker's post content did too and it just feels tiring.

The zones are beautiful, the graphics update is great, the trials and dungeons are phenomenal and Soken has hit it out the park yet again with another incredible soundtrack. Basically everything but the story (my main reason for playing the game) is great in Dawntrail.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive going into Dawntrail as we'd just agreed to help a woman we just met become the next ruler of a nation we knew nothing about, without doing any due diligence to see if she is the best candidate for the job. It seemed like a bit too much of an irresponsible thing for us to be doing. But FFXIV has had low points in its story before and managed to salvage it so I had faith they could pull it off again. They didn't.\n\nWithout getting into spoilers, Dawntrail's story is filled with plot holes, poor dialogue and nonsensical decisions by the characters. Most of the scions are only there for duty support and set dressing ,and if they weren't there, nothing in the plot would change. This includes the player character. I've seen people say that the player acts as a mentor to Wuk Lamat, they are wrong. At no point do we ever give advise to Wuk Lamat, teach Wuk Lamat, nudge Wuk Lamat in the right direction, nothing. We are nothing more than what the NPC's call us, 'Wuk Lamat's attendant.\" I knew we weren't going to be the main character and I was fine with that; I've liked story games where you play a supporting character before (heck even some stories in FFXIV don't have you take leading role). But in those cases your character still has an impact on the plot, here your entirely unnecessary. This is made worse by the fact that there numerous points in the story where your character can and should do/say something but doesn't, which can make the player character come across as a bit evil.\n\nI mentioned Wuk Lamat earlier and she has so much screen time in this that it would be difficult to review this expansion without talking about her. Aside from a short filler interlude in the middle, which happens to be my favourite part, she is a constant in the story. This means that if you do not like Wuk Lamat, you will probably not like the story regardless of whether its other flaws bother you. Personally I did not mind her for most of the expansion, though by the end I was definitely tired of her. It also unfortunately meant less time for other characters to develop, which was a real shame as there were a bunch I wanted to see more of.\n\nAs a last note, while the zones in Dawntrail are all brilliantly crafted and beautiful to look at, zone 6 was so different from everything else in FFXIV that it was jarring.

No. In fact, everything outside of the MSQ is amazing 12/10.

The writing is a roller coaster of bad to great. The pacing is also all over the place and in some instances feels like they had 2 writing teams work on this. There are high moments but few and far between the overall lows. \n\nThe main issue is this expansion is mainly a character focus on Wuk Lamat. If you do not take to her character then you are forced to be her Robin (she being Batman) as she plays the role of the WoL. I myself find her very unlikable, annoying, and horribly written. It was a mistake by the devs to place so much focus on one character when the rest of the NEW (and old) cast in the MSQ is amazing (minus the twins, dunno why they came). Those are the characters I want to spend time with but instead... we're stuck with Wuk Lamat. If you enjoy Wuk Lamat, disregard my negativity but like so many I couldn't wrap my head around why we and other important characters were set aside for Wuk Lamat's story. \n\nI have no doubt given the reception that the team will pivot and recover from this MSQ misstep.

I was surprised how much the new lighting would change things visually.\nThe music has been nice to my ears. The fights engage me unlike the Endwalker ones where there is plenty of time between each move.\n\nSome play through the story to get to the trials and raids.\nI'm mostly here for the story.\nAnd this time sadly wasn't it.\n\nThe beginning of the story was so slow, it took hours to get to the first dungeon. I took multiple breaks because the story couldn't get me hooked.\nThis expansions story is about Wuk Lamat a Tulari princess. She hogs a lot of the screentime in all of the mainstory.\nYou aren't the main character this time, so a big factor to liking this story is liking Wuk Lamat.\nHowever she isn't a good enough character to carry the story, to have her be a narrative black hole like she is.\nShes a naive and easily fooled idealist. She makes mistakes just in line for that kind of character. Repeatedly. Shes never really punished or challenged. Those kinda mistakes have been punished in the story before (Alphinaud and Nanamo).\nThe problem about the narrative black hole isn't her fault, but shes forced into our face basically every chance they get.\nEven players who like her get weary from that. Shes chained to our side, it becomes suffocating.\n\nMany other characters are characterised by their relationship to Wuk Lamat, while some seem have lost their personality. (Krile not teasting Alphinaud, Alisaies sarcasm) They all seem to have the same personality in Dawntrail. They blend into the background if they have nothing to say. I actually forgot Krile was still there since she didn't talk till then.\n\nEven the player character, the wol isnt safe. This time they are a background cheerleader and background emoter.\nThe wol isn't needed in this particular story. He could have been absent and it wouldn't change the story.\nHe isn't the driving factor here, Wuk is.\nHe doesnt get to do the things he did in Heavensward or Stormblood.\nWuk gets to do them.\nWhat we get is speaking to 3 civilians, fetchquests and talking to Wuk Lamat, broken up by a handful of dungeons and trials, the most fun part in this story.\nA significant amount of quest objectives is just talking to Wuk Lamat.\n\nThe mainstory has serious padding issues that send you to hours of detours. There are far more cutscenes and less fighting and solo instances. Its more visual novel than ever.\nThe wol just doesn't matter. Even the camera seems to think so.\n\nIf you are here for the gameplay content in postgame (raids, trials), then there is still something for you.\nIf you are here for the story, you need to like Wuk since she wont leave us to be on our own most of the story.", "timestamp_created": 1720429897, "timestamp_updated": 1720429897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547389984130859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169312277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989812089", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 954544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This expansion is actually so bad it might actually be the nail in the coffin for Square Enix.\n\nGraphics: Maximum Preset\nResolution: 7680 x 2160\nGame/Voice Language: English\n\nThe following content may contain spoilers\n\nThe good:\n\u2192 Dungeons are interesting and challenging this time around.\n\u2192 Trials are also good, although I haven't done the Extreme versions at the time of writing this.\n\u2192 Music is brilliant at times.\n\u2192 The new updated graphics are quite nice (if you've got the specs to take advantage).\n\nThe bad:\n\u2192 Everything revolves around everybody's favorite kitten Wuk Lamat.\n\u2192 Characters that completely lack any personality and change completely within just a few quests.\n\u2192 While the first half of the expansion might be \"passable\" it only gets worse from there.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\u2192 You're a side-character for the entire story and just when you think you've got your moment Wuk Lamat steals the spotlight.\n\u2192 Wuk Lamat feels like a Dungeon Master's self-inserted character that's there to play the hero.\n\u2192 The Scions might as well not have been there at all as they don't really add anything to the story.\n\u2192 Questionable morals at best, genocide at worst.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\u2192 Removal of cutscenes where Wuk Lamat steals what is clearly your moment.\n\u2192 In fact, just remove the later half of the expansion and call it a vacation.\n\nI cried at the end, but not for the reasons you might think...

It's fed to you as if you were the target audience of said Disney writing, and leaves nothing up to inference or mystery. Explains everything in plain words, instead of leaving anything up to intrigue. We're in an unknown land for goodness sake, there should be something that's a mystery. On top of that, some of the zones feel like ripoffs of SB areas (Notably the 4th & 6th area) with none of the good parts, trying to capitalise on that success and nostalgia. \n\nWuk Lamat's voice talent is honestly terrible. Her lines (in English) are so badly delivered, phoned in, canned, whatever you want to call it. Wouldn't be a big deal if she didn't talk for 95% of the main scenario quests, but we're taking a supporting character role in this expansion, so she does. There's some emotional moments (high and low) involving her that are entirely ruined by the delivery of lines. The writing is also rubbish, like a mix between an anime protagonist and a Disney princess.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is fun, that being dungeons, trials, and the class changes. I love this game, having almost 3,000 hours as of writing, but this is the first time I've felt like they've missed the mark badly.\n\nIf you don't have a high cringe tolerance, and think you'll have $30 in the future, consider a story skip ticket for when the next expansion comes out to avoid this. I just hope post-patch content can redeem this expansion going forward.\n\nFinally, it would be remiss of me to not mention the excellent job that Erenville's VA did.

IDK who thought it would be a good idea to be tied to Wuk the entire time, but I'm so tired of how bland and one dimensional she is. She acts like a naive child, which can work as a side character, but not the main character that she is in this story. I actually kinda liked her when she was introduced in Endwalker.

However, the story is really disappointing. Not necessarily because of the plot or pacing, but the lack of voiced cutscenes compared to ShB and Endwalker is honestly awful in comparison. Barely 1 in 5 cutscenes are voiced at all, and most of the ones that are tend to be pretty short. It's crazy to me that the mobile games I play nowadays have more fully voice-acted cutscenes than an MMO that I pay a monthly subscription fee AND an entry-fee for the expansion. It feels extremely cheap and makes me just skip every cutscene that wasn't voiced. If the developers can't be bothered to put voice-acting in the cutscene, I'll just assume it's unimportant. Because if they don't care that much, why should I?\n\nI can't really recommend it, especially to new players. The lack of effort puts it around post-ARR or post-Heavensward content for story engagement.

I'M EXHAUSTED FROM BOREDOM PLAYING THIS. \n\nBut lets start with the good first and the good is very good.\n\n1. Class changes aside from some minor adjustments that are already planned to be fixed have been fantastic. as someone who got all classes to max and mains dark knight i have been loving how the classes play.\n2. Music is fantastic. If a bit unfitting in some areas (the jazz while nice is a bit unfitting for a south america locations. is still great to listen to and is not unwelcome)\n3. Graphics update is great\n5. dungeons and bosses are fantastic, just wish players stop being on auto pilot as there's a lot of people who seem to be used to not paying attention, but this will be fixed when people get more used to the fights. \n\n+++DAWNTRAIL SPOILERS+++\nNow for the Bad, and its mostly to do with the story and how it execution harms the good points stated above.\n\n1. The names for locations, people, and others are way too long and sometimes hard to pronounce and memorize. This might not be an issue 2 years in but right now its hard to coordinate teleport points or when treasure hunts happen. I can see typing locations to be a pain in text chat box.\n\n2. On the topic of characters naming is the most minor thing. The bigger issue is the story is all over the place. Characters who seem important get shafted halfway through so we don't get time to appreciate them or see them grow (BaKool Ja ja is the best example of this.) But what you get is the introduction of the wider cast with the Promises, the Dawn Servant, And the people of Turial, only for them to be shafted halfway through the story. Only for the story to REINTRODUCE A NEW SET OF CHARACTERS HALFWAY THROUGH AND DO IT IN LESS TIME. \n\n3. The story is too long and without substance, leading to needless padding. Started playing with my and my friends around noon. and by the end of the day at nearly 10pm we had JUST reached the first dungeon, no trial in sight. The padding of pointless sidequests, long cutscenes that say nothing and a focus on Wuk Lamat (Ill get to her later) lead to our enjoyment and exploration of the locations we encounter feeling boring. For a land inspired by the Americas there's a shocking lack of adventure, it really says something when the EW post expansion had a better feeling of \"fresh start adventure\" than the entirety of Dawntrail had.\n\n4. Alexandria being the poster child for MMO bloat. After the trailers showing off the new land of Turail, the south american adventure, the culture, the festivity, only to play through the expansion and to have the gate to the golden city JINGLED in front of us only to go \"nah ignore that\" really stings, and is even worse when quite literally the Resilient Son vanishes for an hour and him, and high tech world come out of left field with minimal build up. From here all you learned about Turial becomes moot as now you have to learn about the new lore for this mysterious land that attacks you, has no connection to Turial in ANY WAY, and to make it worse there's also a 30 YEAR TIME SKIP....SO WE HAVE TO LEARN 30 YEARS WORTH OF LORE FOR AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED IN MOST AN HOUR.\n\n5. Weak Villains overall with no clear villain throughout the entire Expansion. In HW it was Thordin and Nidhog, In Stormblood it was the Garleans, Shadow Bringers it was the Light, Vauthry, and Emet Selch. EW it was Zodiark and the final failures of the ascians come to haunt the modern day, all of which was built up since Stormblood. The ascians had acted as background villains to move the plot along since 1.0 with the main villains of each expansion being assisted by them. Here, no such idea exists, and the story jumps Villains when not needed anymore.  With Bakool Ja Ja getting rushed development (Still love our boy) To the Resilient Son's Motive, and finally Sphene being the villain out of a MASSIVE flimsy excuse and motives that the story itself even points are inconsistent. \n\nOn the topic of Zoraal Ja, The Resilient Son. he as a VERY weak villain as his characterization seems to be muddied and inconsistent at best. What we do know is this: He has feelings of Inadequacy due to his birth being a miracle, and thus having to live up to his father, and that hes a militarist. This is where our knowledge of him stops. WHY hes a conqueror is not know and his personal beliefs are not known, maybe its because he wants more land for his people?? but Turial has never been show to be lacking in resources (minus a storm but that's natural) nor has it been shown hes competent as his intro is talking about how he LOST a military campaign. these plot points are never addressed and the story assumes hes just petty and wants the crown so bad! but because we never spend time with him, get to know his points, or even get his mindset he flops. at base he wants to prove himself by being a king for the people...\n\nSo why, WHY does he go to future kingdom, take it over, oppress the people for 30 years, have a kid for NO reason, and still decided \"I need to kill my dad and take Turial\" the character changes on a dime.\n\nThen theres Wuk lamat\n\n6. Wuk Lamat, Dear heavens above Wuk Lamat, The pinnacle of everything wrong with this Expansion. To start this character was introduced late into EW, Unlike other expansions leading into the new one the final update finally introduces her. I had a gut feeling about her when she was introduced with her being little too upbeat and in your face, with attempts to make the players like her right off the bat with comical moments and quotes. The character came off having very similar tropes to a shonen protagonist akin to luffy or naruto. But with her being unable to fully commit to battle I thought that this could lead to an interesting flaw \"they want to be Dawn Servant but lack the resolve to do anything.\" This flaw is barely addressed and is soon forgotten about. \n\nBut lets start with the biggest issue, the Story is OBSESSED with her, to the point shes considered the main character and it comes at a detriment because shes very unlikable and the story seems to bend itself over for her. She lacks flaws other than what was mentioned above and that she \"cares too much about people\" which hinders the exploration. people have often said that the WoL isn't the MC of this adventure to where I ask \"Why aren't we?\" Wuk Lamat is from this new world, but always takes our chances to learn about people.\n\nIts Wuk Lamat who rides the floats, solves the problems, kills the bosses, tames the Llamas, becomes Dawn Servant, Knows the people, WoL? whos that? Wuk of Lamat? Now watch her become Dawn Servant with her equally forgettable cat brother. Watch ass scions, including you, gas her up and fawn over her and cheer her on as she solves EVERYONES problems but makes US do everything. This could've been an interesting flaw with how she relies on outside help too much but once again the story is too busy congratulating her to know this. And finally halfway through the story where she finally looks like she will retire and we can go on an adventure SHE COMES BACK. The story focuses on her too much, to the point its at our detriment without any reason for us to care or like her. It doesn't help that her VA work is very flat, talking normally is fine but any amount of cadence or emotion falls flat and seems like a line read, the VA being inexperienced doesn't help nor does Wuk Lamat having more voice lines that any character by far. \n\nAt the end of the day I dont think Wuk lamat could be salvaged, even if they got better reads or VA I think that FF14 team has a large uphill battle for the story and it starts with retiring Wuk Lamat.", "timestamp_created": 1720411103, "timestamp_updated": 1720467894, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54009091854095459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169300451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049349275", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 417393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 915, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I just don't know what to say that you haven't already read a hundred times but this MSQ was mostly just not enjoyable.\nIt would be fine if it was just Wuk Lamat being Wuk Lamat, but rather than each character having their own clear personality and quirks it feels like they're all quoting from the same book of phrases.

It's not all bad. The graphics update was certainly worthwhile. I think the zones and battle content are some of the best yet, and the music is excellent, but the MSQ greatly soured the whole experience for me. I was enjoying it for about the first half despite some *interesting* story decisions, but by the time I got to the last third of the MSQ I was completely checked out emotionally. It felt like the writers were trying to make me feel things but failing miserably, especially in the last third story of the story. Maybe it was a \"death by a thousand cuts\" sort of thing for me. I'll try not to get excessively spoilery in this review but I will obviously be discussing the story so be warned.\n\nI really wanted to like Wuk Lamat, but at this point I'd be very happy not to ever have to see her again. Some of her \"development\" didn't really feel earned, and I wish that there was more showing and less telling when it came to her ideals. I think it's tempting for some to solely blame the English VA but there's only so much one can do with voice direction and script they're given. There's only so much repetition of the phrase \"my people\" that I can take, and this was greatly exceeded. Unfortunately in the last third of the MSQ another character began over-using this phrase and that's about when I'd had enough. I don't hate Wuk Lamat's guts but I really REALLY could have used some more space from her. After a while I audibly sighed every time I was separated from the Scions to go do something with her as my sole companion.\n\nSpeaking of the Scions, it really felt like they were there for the Duty Support system and that's it. The player character hardly gets to spend any time with them, and their interactions are usually limited to backing up Wuk Lamat verbally during whatever story beat was going on. I've heard others describe them as \"cardboard cutouts\" of themselves and unfortunately I have to agree. I may be in the minority on still enjoying the Scions, but I really missed them despite them technically being there. The extent of \"competition\" story beat that was hyped up was like 10 seconds in a dungeon, no joke. Also I really wish Krile's and Erenville's arcs would have gotten more time and focus than they did.\n\nI didn't really find any of the villains compelling and some of the motivations didn't really make sense to me. There was also a character that IMO got a very undeserved 180 in personality, outlook, and treatment. I feel like saying anything else on this subject would be too spoilery.\n\nHmm, other things. There were plenty of plot points here and there that felt contrived. At one point the WoL and the other Scions prove themselves to somehow be the worst bodyguards ever. Another contestant for the throne breaks a competition rule that is outright stated early on but doesn't get disqualified, and the fact that they broke the rule is never commented on. There was also foreshadowing of a certain character possibly having their own agenda outside of the contest of the throne, but they are killed off without fanfare or any reveal of their intentions. There are several scenarios where the WoL and co kind of stand around and watch as something bad happens, and rarely is there an explanation for why. Moral questions are posed in the last third of the game and then never really feel like they are adequately answered. \n\nI feel like it would be hyperbole to say that Dawntrail is worse than ARR given how much better its battle content, zones, and music are but  as far as the story I think I did enjoy myself much less. I've never actually disliked a MSQ story before this one. None of the previous stories have had me praying for it to just be over already. FWIW I enjoyed the melee role quest, the expert dungeons, and I'm a bit interested in the hinted direction of where the story could go next. But the overwhelming feeling for me right now is just disappointment and sadness.

[/h1]\n\nThere's so many things extremely wrong in this new expansion so many...The story of Dawntrail, is one of the worst i ever seen. \n\nIf you guys thinking stormblood was bad, well....stormblood is gold compared to this.\n\n35\u20ac of painful cutscenes, cringe and boring dialogues and one of the worst towns with the hateful music ever, and worst of all, a new entry of the worst Final Fantasy character ever in the list: Wuk Lamat.\n\n[h2] Let's start with the good parts of the expansion. [/h2]\n\nLet's start with the fact, many pepole (me included) was curious of the new jobs, The Viper is very cool and very fast with nice skills and the combat style it uses, the pictomancer is funny to use for main casters. (Not in my case.)\nThe ambience (with one exception) it looks good, Tuliyollal have a chill BGM it looks an vacation village, probably because is inspired by latin america locations, if wasn't the fact there's a zone reminded me a little wild arms and of course the final area.\nThe dungeons and trials are a little challenging with little addictions, considering the side note i progressed in the expansion with 660 of item level on the entire time and the final trial was chaotic in mechanics.\nAbout the new graphical update i couldn't pretend much for an 2010 engine but is much clean with new dynamic lights and few improvements of the textures and models.\n\n[h2] But all these new stuff they added and graphical update with 2 new jobs, it will not save this expansion from what it deserves. [/h2]\n\n\"It's not just about telling a story, but taking into consideration the emotions of the player.\nI think that characters are born from a story; I rarely come up with the character first and then build a story around them.\"\nThis quote is from Kazutoyo Maehiro, one of the best writer in FF14 history and one of the creators of Havensward, one of the expansions with the best story between the others....but dawntrail story lead by Daichi Hiroi....Is a Storytelling failure.\n\nAll i felt in the entire dawntrail MSQ, aren't good emotions.....just boredom, repulsion, cringe and anger in negative way, and i skipped the majority of the cutscenes and painful fetch quests, all i saw from the rest i didn't skipped is below average even for FF14 standards, i know our WoL is in vacation on the first part but at least involve WoL in something exciting and fun, [spoiler] the only fun part of the story on the first half was sparring with Gulool Ja Ja with the cool music of the trailer, for the rest is one of the ridiculous trials to become the future ruler of Tuliyollal i couldn't imagine, with all the trials someone can think in a competition to become the heir of the throne they choose the worst. Normally if you want put someone in the condition to rule a kingdom, you need to test him to see if it's ready for the throne in the future, testing the courage, the strength, the skill in battle and the intelligence to resolve problems and guide the troops to war, why i say these examples?..well...because the rite of succession is one of the stupidiest contest i ever seen, and there's many better ideas than capturing an alpaca, cooking, find someone to craft a vase ecc....the only good part of the rite of the succession was fighting the illusion of Gulool Ja Ja and nothing else. [/spoiler] \nTo make things worse is the desperate attempt to look Wuk Lamat as protagonist setting aside the WoL with the other scions for the entire MSQ, [spoiler] Krile excluded. [/spoiler] Wuk Lamat is the classic airhead but more annoying, with the childish utopia of eternal peace and she litreally intervenes everytime she have the chance and sometimes It was very forced in some cutscenes and it's embaracing and stupid, [spoiler] For example in the second phase of the final trial, instead of G'raha Tia or Krile, only Wuk Lamat appears with an annoying force. [/spoiler] \n\n[spoiler] The other characters like Zoraal Ja and Bakool Ja Ja are a wasted potential to be nice characters in the story, Zoral Ja (Jotaro's Voice XD) it was irrilevant but decent, even after he turns to be the villain and his fight it was amazing. Bakool Ja Ja....is just a banal bully who becomes good after being beaten, but not by the WoL...i let you guys guess who beats Bakool Ja Ja. [/spoiler] \n\nEvery single MSQ quest have always most of the time these 4 words \"Talk to Wuk Lamat\" over and over and over and over, and the high level of cringe dialogues in some quests turns the fetch quests and cutscenes in general into a painful torture, too many gags and setting aside the WoL, even the rest of the scions are beign setting aside [spoiler] in fact estinien rarely appeared at difference of the other scions (Poor Estinien). [/spoiler]\n\nNow let's get to the worst location of the new continent, Solution Nine is unforgivable and very out of place in a game like final fantasy, and the BGM....it's truly unbearable, for the sake of my sanity anytime i had to go there i turn the BGM off and i hated every minute anytime i set foot in that place.\n\nWuk Lamat is one of the worst characters ever made, no development, no intresting backstory, absolutely nothing and annoying like a mosquito when you try to sleep.\n\nIn conclusion of this review and half rant, this new expansion beyond the graphic update, the new continent and the new classes, the storytelling is a complete disaster and unsufficient for the final fantasy standards...and im honestly worried of the future of FF14 one of the best MMORPG i spent 6 years, because if this is new lead story designer vision for the future journey of WoL this will make many pepole skip all everything and many story enjoyers will be disappointed from this direction is going to be......Daichi Hiroi, hope you will see the feedback of how wrong is this story and make at least the endgame MSQ intresting because otherwise, many pepole will abandon FF14 forever.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict for Dawntrail story: 2/10 [/h1]\n\nSquare Enix this is not okay, this is not how a story should be written and with Yoshi'p not having full control of the story writing, the story quality of future expansions and updated will be extremely affected.\n\nIf this was Daichi's writing of the expansion, im afraid it will gets worse....and this is not forgivable.", "timestamp_created": 1720392062, "timestamp_updated": 1720392365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540339946746826172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169283391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326603824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I were really excited, hoped for some more protagonist lore while helping wuk lamat with her throne as a side msq motive.

I am not going to mention the VA for Wuk Lamat because that's it's own issue that is barely contributing to the negative feelings I have for this expansion. The story is very padded out and filled with filler. There are no character growths except for Krile and Erenville, both of whom got shafted for the focus on Wuk Lamat. Wuk Lamat has no character growth and no real plot relevance other than being made the ruler of Yok Tural. \n\nThe biggest flaw with this expansion, more specifically the MSQ, is the pacing. There are times where it gets interesting and you can see the individual threads leading where it could to something greater, but those moments lead to disappointments. I feel as though this should have been two different expansions, one focusing on Yok Tural and the other focusing on the plight of Solution 9 and their queen. \n\nI don't mind the job changes as I usually only play healer, but the complaints about jobs like Monk and Astrologian are negligible because it can be changed later in patches. You can't rewrite an entire story in patches, and that's the biggest disappointment considering that the previous expansions, while they may have had their flaws, contained moments of growth and stellar writing.\n\nOverall, I have to give this a 3/10. The reason is that while the MSQ was extremely slow and boring, the trials and dungeons were much touched up on and felt fun to run through consecutively. The graphic changes are nice, although I wouldn't have minded if they could have gone bigger with the changes.

Kinda painful. It keeps getting to points where something interesting is going on then it stops and throws you back into the boring stuff again. I've never been the type to skip cutscenes through over a decade of playing, but Dawntrail got me so close multiple times that I just closed the game and did something more interesting.\nEverything is explicitly explained to you MULTIPLE times, with the supporting characters being so stupid they don't understand what has been literally demonstrated directly in front of them. Paired with the rest of the generic sh\u014dnen anime style writing, it feels like this expansion was written for children. I like the new characters, But all the writing around them is kinda awful.\nI'm really confused why they would write something so simplified and explicitly explained to you, while requiring you to go through several far better written expansions to reach it. \n\nGraphics update wise, the first half of the zones are nice looking, but they get progressively more barren and boring after that. I've had to turn most settings down to minimum to be able to run it at a tolerable framerate on my modest 2018-19 machine (which is fair, I guess), especially the amount of characters displayed which they blatantly ignore in multiple cutscenes, forcing me to render crowds that slow my game massively. In fact, amount of characters rendered is the only setting that significantly affects my framerate, which seems like an optimisation issue to me. Every other setting is a minor change. The DLSS seems to help too, though nowhere near as much as everyone seems to insist for other games.\nBesides throwing fleshy characters into the uncanny valley, I don't personally see much effect in pre-existing areas besides making the shine from rain nicer. After seeing what they'd done to my Miqo'te, I was glad I'd already planned to switch to fem Hrothgar immediately. Seeing my new character in action has honestly been a significant part of what dragged me through this expansion.\n\nFight difficulty has definitely been cranked up significantly in this expansion. Sometimes it's fun, but there have definitely been a few examples of things I just don't understand at all since I don't really have the brain for extreme trials etc, I'm easily overwhelmed and combined with everything else it's draining my motivation to keep playing. I know that's a positive point to a lot of people though, even though there's been more and more content for them over the past few expansions, taking away from what people like myself can actually access. Again this isn't a hard negative point but it's definitely contributing to me feeling like maybe this game just isn't for me any more. Maybe I'll go back to dancer.", "timestamp_created": 1720354974, "timestamp_updated": 1720358725, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480558961629867554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169234820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807585520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Before playing I was reading reviews and was pretty clear that the story would suck and that most positive reviews were just review bombing and people coping. But I decided to buy and play for the battle content and social aspect any way, it`s a shame I had to support this garbage story to be able to play those.\n\nNow to explain how it was reading reviews vs playing: I started the msq deciding to watch the cutscenes and read dialogue, so I could get my own opinion, I already knew that I wouldn't like Wuk Lamat probably, but hey, there are other characters as well and the plot doesn't seem bad on a high level, right? Turns out that yes, the plot isn't bad, I enjoyed some of the early cutscenes and some of the new character introductions and dialogues and I think it would be very possible for this to be an epic adventure despite being the beginning of a new story. But then came the reason why Yawntrail was coined: the stupid pointless quests. It got me to a point that I decided to only watch voiced cutscenes or read cutscenes that would precede some major moments in the story. However, as I played more and more I realized that even those cutscenes were irrelevant, I was flabbergasted that some cutscenes leading out of the early dungeons added LITTLE to NOTHING to the story. I became what I despised for years, a certified cutscene skipper. I literally don't care anymore, I'm in lvl 94 msq, I have some idea of what's going on and I'm looking forward to finishing this crap and watching some youtube summary on the story to catch up.\n\nNow to Wuk Lamat. She's not a problem in itself, what makes her insufferable is how the devs decided to show her. They try too hard, and I mean too hard, to make her seem likeable. Most of her interactions feel forced, she's an annoying mary sue that feels unbelieavable most of the time and what's worse: most cutscenes I've watched were like 5-10 mins of her crying and being consolated for something, detracting from what was actually happening in the bigger picture to show us her internal conflict. That in itself isn't the problem when done in moderation (pay attention to this word, moderation), but when you make an entire cast to be just blind emotional supporters to her that offer no solid advice or try to confront her beliefs and show her a new way of thinking, then it stops being about character growth and becomes about trying to get the reader to feel sorry for the character, over and over again. It's nice to be empathetic, but in order to do that we need to relate to the characters and as of now she's completely unrelatable. Her father is cool though, and the other claimants got me more interested in them than in Wuk Lamat, sad, right?\n\nNow to the battle content, I've done the two first dungeons and the trial. Much better than EW dungeons and trials so far, I can't point exactly why, but the mechs seem more fun and engaging. I also enjoyed the changes to black mage as I've always been a standard line user, so my life hasn't changed much and it feels good not to need to weave sharpcast all the time. So far I'm interested in trying some other jobs as well and I'm excited for the other dungeons, trials and raids, as well as the glamour. The 2 dyes system is really refreshing but it's so sad that they left raid gear from savages out of it. \n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is music. Most of the tracks don't seem to fit the aesthetic, they don't bring tribal elements or instruments into the mix, but worst of all: I've played both lvl 91 and 93 dungeons twice so far and... I don't think I remember how the tune goes? The boss music, completely unremarkable as well. Now compare that to Stormblood, Shadowbringers and Endwalker, they have so much more identity and really pop, making the boss battles feel more epic and high stakes. The main theme is good, I like it, but the derived themes and orchestrations don't seem to go the extra mile that the previous expansions went, at least so far. I won't compare to ARR and HW as I don't remember most of those, save for a few tracks.\n\nThis is my long rant about the game. solid 2/10, but I still play because I know the frustration is temporary.

This might be the worst expansion \"story wise\" we've gotten.

The story is ungodly slow, the pacing is rough, the quests disengage you, and the characters we all know and love kinda take a back seat in this one. \n\nNot saying its complete garbage, Viper and Pictomancer are great additions to the classes we already have. The dungeons are great and colorful, music is always on point, and the boss fights are awesome. Its a new expansion so everything that comes with the new content is a welcome addition. \n\nThis is the one expansion I had to switch over to the JPN voices because the ENG VO for Wuk Lamat is kinda bad.

If i can group the expansions from Worst to Best it would definitely be: Dawntrail, Stormblood, Endwalker, Heavensward, and Shadowbringers. \n\nAs a fan, definitely get the expansion as there will be plenty to do. But either skip the MSQ and just go straight to end game, or go in knowing you'll more than likely be disappointed by a lot of things. Best of luck WoL! \n\nWhile I do recommend the Expansion, this story is ass, and I'll give the story a thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1720342025, "timestamp_updated": 1720342025, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558462202548980713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169217015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158206295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "Hmm sehr komisch das ich ein Fr\u00fchzugang-code bekomme und f\u00fcr die Gegenst\u00e4nde Ingame. aber mir jetzt der Edition Key fehlen tut.

It's about what I expected, it's really messy and full to the brim with plot holes. Everything in regards to \"why the big bad needs to do the big bad\" would have worked in a book for middle school kids, but it's so littered with alternative solutions where anyone with half a brain can come up with one that I just can't connect to their emotions and justification for their actions. Why do the souls of those passed need to be made manifest to the point where your soul upkeep is more than your soul generation? Why was it absolutely necessary to create this perfect dreamland for them? Why couldn't they just be put into robots like Otis, like, you've already proven an effective method of retaining a soul that doesn't require you to feed them soul energy to maintain them. Why couldn't you just reserve that for the members of Royalty? At least if you did that, you could expand that story into a point of contention that becomes a major plot point - maybe a splinter faction group finds it unfair that only Royalty can maintain their immortality and they want it for themselves (creating a \"de-facto Ascian\" situation where they just keep coming back over and over like the Ascians did after you destroyed their body but not their soul) or they want the practice to end for ethical reasons? What if the plot points becomes that there are too many soul-robots and it's destroying the local environments? What if the soul-robots get hacked and used to take over the world, kinda like how Otis was forcefully commanded by lizardboy?\n\nOr, if putting them into robots doesn't work, why not set up \"visitation centers\" where people who want to visit their deceased loved ones can manifest them temporarily and they can do whatever it is they want to do, and then when their time expires, the manifestation gets unmade. Then, your plot point could be that someone really evil managed to escape the \"unmaking\" and steals the technology for visitation centers to continuously print his evil friends and they wreak havoc in Tural?\n\nYou could have written about any number of justifications for \"the big bad needing to do big bad things\", but the one they went with is just so frail in its construction that I just can't take it seriously. But no, because they went with this really stupid \"problem\", they have to turn it into a \"world-ending\" threat, but the delivery of it all has zero impact.\n\nIt's like I said in my original review: [b]how can you top Endwalker's \"universe-ending\" threat?[/b] That's a bar they've set and they need some serious time and effort to come up with a story that can meet that bar.\n\nI forgot to mention a couple of things in my original review, and there are some other things to address as well:\n\n-- No, I do not care about babysitting Wuk Lamat. That has no sway on the review that I gave for Dawntrail. We've done much more mundane and boring things in the past, so babysitting her throughout the expansion was a drop in the bucket. A lot of people seemed to be really annoyed by this, but I didn't mind it at all.\n\n-- No, I do not care about the voice acting issues. I play with Japanese Dub + English Sub. Their voice acting was good in the JP dub. However, the translation team really needs to stop taking so many creative liberties with the translation. There were far too many instances where they clearly say a very distinct word/phrase in JP and the English translation says something completely different.\n\n-- I am fully aware that the writing team has been given a shakeup ever since Endwalker ended. That does not excuse the fact that somebody approved this story. If it were up to me, I would have pushed back hard and told them to rewrite numerous sections in every phase of Dawntrail. There is far too much room for improvement. This is a classic case of amateur hour being given way too much leeway.\n\n-- The class changes are very, very good. Yoshi-P and the balance team have gotten extremely talented at improving \"game feel\" so that rotations and playstyles aren't clunky.\n\n-- Not exactly restricted to Dawntrail, but the game has been in need of a change to the player camera for a while now. They should have increased the amount you can zoom out two expansions ago, and that was something I wish that they addressed along with the graphics update. One of the expert dungeons involves tracking an entity that circles around the arena and you have to be far away from it. When there's only one to track, that's not an issue, but tracking two when the camera is so zoomed in and you have a giant enemy covering 20% of the screen, it's very easy to lose track of one or the other, especially with all the visual bloat (even with limited visuals enabled). A wider FOV would also help immensely.\n\n==END OF EDIT==\n\nThis has to be the weakest storytelling I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing for a Final Fantasy game.\n\nThe first half is pretty good. You're part of a tournament to see who is worthy enough to take the throne. Awesome, that's a great plot point that you can flesh out into a countless number of substories and characterizations.\n\nThe second half is where they just throw everything out the window and said \"oops, we ended that story arc a bit too quickly, we can't release half an expansion worth of story! fuck it, throw in some cowboys and alien tech.\"\n\nBut what pisses me off the most is that, in the first half of the story, your character is lauded as a hero of legendary status, and for the most part, you show for it. In the second half of the story, your character (and your allies, too) act like a bunch of dimwits who are somehow shellshocked by a single humanoid wearing armor with glowy purple lines. Like, at this point, you've all defeated literal Gods, you've fought with a world-destroying monstrosity at the edge of the universe, but all it takes is one lizard boy to make you freeze up? What in tarnation... who wrote this garbage?? It's the worst way to force a plot point and it's downright insulting to the players.\n\nWe didn't play through numerous expansions building up this legendary character only to have them act like this.\n\nI can keep going on, but for the most part, there are multiple other reviewers who have already pointed out that the expansion is littered with:\n\n[code]\"This is a field. We grow crops here, in case you didn't know.\"[/code]\n\nIt's just sickening at this point. MadSeasonShow had a very compelling point when it comes to storytelling. \n\nQuote:\n\n[code]\"[...] and that's the problem once again with these 'Marvel-like', grandiose, epic, world-shattering storylines where the player is this ultimate savior and badass of the world - best friends with Khadgar, best friends with Magni - it just doesn't work in an MMO because, not only is it multiplayer - it's hard to be the savior of the world when everyone else is - but... you also paint yourself into a corner because... how do you top that?\"[/code]\n\nAnd that exact problem becomes very apparent in Dawntrail. We've saved the universe from the giant space lady. Square Enix now has to acknowledge that your character and their allies are capable of these feats. If they treat them any less, if they act like they are not powerful enough to tackle a challenge of lesser or equal measure, then you're just insulting the player's intelligence. We're not stupid, we know (from both a gameplay perspective, a lore perspective, and a roleplaying perspective) what our character is capable of, and the writers have to respect that much, but they don't do that in Dawntrail.\n\nIt's compelling to me because this is why One Punch Man is extremely popular. The author of OPM respects Saitama's power. There is no point in that story where the author tries to subvert that claim. The writers for Dawntrail did not share that same respect, and that's what I take issue with.", "timestamp_created": 1720296776, "timestamp_updated": 1721548738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519658923149108887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169174017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054386337", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never felt the need for a neutral button in Steam reviews more than here.\n\nTLDR: Everything but the story is good to great but the story drags it down hard.\n\n[b]Battle content: A++[/b]. The dungeons are great. The trials are great. Even the solo instances are decent. They upped the difficulty in a way that feels fair, which was much needed after Endwalker. This is especially true as a healer main who was falling asleep in dungeons because there was nothing for me to do but spam my one attack.\n\n[b]Zone design: A-[/b]. Most of the zones are gorgeous and have great atmosphere. I have a few quibbles, like zone 6 being laid out really weird and non-intuitively. There's a controversial thing that happens with zone 6 near the end as well but honestly I respect it from a narrative standpoint.\n\n[b]Music: A-[/b]. Down a bit from the heights of Shadowbringers and Endwalker but still very good. A few obvious misses, where you're left wondering \"why is this style of song playing here?\". If you've played through you probably know the ones I'm talking about. Special shoutout to Trial 2's music being an absolute banger.\n\nNow I'm gonna split story into a few parts here to more easily explain my issues:\n[b]Plot narrative: C-[/b]. While it's not *bad* on its face, there are a number of things that happen (or don't happen) that seem to have zero setup or justification. That's not to mention a few major, gaping plot holes. There are also two main plot threads, and they aren't woven together well at all, more just kinda smooshed together.\n\n[b]Treatment of major themes: C[/b]. There are some clear major themes in Dawntrail. They are competently touched on, but not explored with any real depth, sans one single cutscene that felt out of place for how poignant it was compared to the rest of the surface-level writing.\n\n[b]Pacing: C[/b]. It could be a lot worse, like 2.x, but it could be a lot better. This I think goes back to my complaint about the two main plotlines not being woven together at all, making the whole thing feel a lot more dragged out than it otherwise would have.\n\n[b]Voice acting: B-[/b]. The main character's performance is competent if uneven. Some other characters put on great performances, others laughable. The scions for whatever reason sound a bit worse than previous. Dunno what's going on there. There are also some odd choices in terms of what was voiced and what wasn't.\n\n[b]Character writing: F-[/b]. The big black mark of the expansion thus far. The scions are utterly lobotimzed into \"we're here for duty support slots\" or at best exposition dumps. The villains have nonsensical motives and change them on a dime. Other scion-adjacent characters who were supposed to get some shine got far too little and had their plotlines rushed. The main character who is ostensibly in a growth arc grows only in confidence and not competence. There are also a number of saturday morning cartoon-level character gags repeated ad nauseum, especially in the first half. This part of the xpac was an unmitigated disaster, and the controversial main character is only a small part of it.\n\nSo overall, I'm ultimately neutral on this. Why do I then give it a thumbs down? I give it a thumbs down because this is ostensibly a story-first MMO. No other MMO gets as much shine for its story as this game does. While I enjoy the battle content, the crafting/gathering, etc, the story is ultimately what keeps me engaged.

I'll keep it brief because there's just too much to whine about.\n\nInstead of casually exploring and questing in this new world, seeing it's amazing landscapes and learning the unique cultures first hand you are permanently tethered to Wuk Lamat. Even if you like Wuk Lamat I think this goes against the spirit of the expansion's theme but not a big deal. \n\nThe problem is Wuk Lamat is poorly voiced/directed (think Gal Gadot in that one scene where she's on the hood of a car yelling at Pedro Pascal), naive, never gets punished for her decisions and never gets a chance to stick to her morals DESPITE the harsh realities of politics, instead politics conform to her. The poor writing couldn't even live up to the most obvious character arc an easily entertained ape like I could think of.\n\nThe rest of the cast are no better, barely memorable. There are 3 side characters and 2 main characters in the entire story that live up to FFXIV's genuine writing style and pedigree and they get very little screen time before the plot moves on or their arc resolves. I don't mind existing characters being ignored as much as others but when they are included I wish they weren't because it feels contrived and rushed.\n\nTLDR: The entire main quest gets hijacked by a polarizing character at the detriment to everything else, including the stated goal of the expansion in marketing, the characters featured in marketing, FFXIV's writing, the feeling of slowly exploring new lands and cultures and even the WoL as a separate entity to the player. It's like paying $50 to read a teenager's fan fic where they insert their perfect character into their favorite IP.", "timestamp_created": 1720293116, "timestamp_updated": 1728228057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495183378458023071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169169762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069805468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to start off by saying this, I understand there were probably struggles with writing this expansion.

Story wise, this expansion was a major fail.\n\nAs for classes, the class changes seem to be pretty decent. Only really leveled Black Mage, but I have touched a few other classes. Pictomancer seems to be interesting and Viper has a lot going on and probably is suffering the same issue as Ninja.\n\nOf course, this is just the start of the expansion.

FFXIV suffers from toxic positivity, much of the community is just a copefest to get people to come in and play their game, any criticism is met with \"Go play another expansion then\" or \"Go play another game\" as if you can't criticize anything. Criticism of the clearly amateur voice acting is met with \"You hate trans people\"\n\nView the rest of this at your own risk, since they are spoilers, though there isn't even much to spoil to begin with. \n\n[Spoiler]If you followed the hype train in any way, your expectations will not be met at all, they dropped the ball HARD with this one. The only good things I can say about this expansion are that the graphics update is pretty, nice QOL changes, new classes are fun, the dungeons are a marked improvement, but other than that everything else is worse. People sub to this game for the MSQ, so if the MSQ is not good then there's not much reason to play this game. FFXIV has good content sure, but if it's all about content only FFXIV is outclassed by many other games like WOW, ESO, GW2, like let's be honest here, FFXIV was never the top dog because of content, it was because of having good content, a good dev team, AND an amazing story which you could follow. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]The story clearly borders on false advertising, it's advertised as this brand new adventure, where the WOL is competing with his fellow scions for the rite of succession to become Dawnservant. Essentially, the first half is a generic anime tournament arc, but it's done in one of the most laughably awful ways. NONE of the characters are interesting, the three competitors are as follows: Fascist Lizard Guy, Roman Empire Lizard Guy, and Capitalist Mi'qote / industrialist. There is no political intrigue, and it barely delves into any kind of political tension whatsoever. There are no ideological clashes either, and the \"rites\" are the most laughably boring quests i've ever played in an MMO. FFXIV is was never the best with quest design, but my god this is a new low. The rites are ALL exposition dumps, where you are told small details about the village, and about tribes who are honestly not very interesting and lack depth. Every tribe can be described in a single sentence, Pelupelu like trading with people, Hanu Hanu love farming and have a funny dance to regrow reeds, the hroth tribe were at war with mamool ja and made a truce with a food. The Mamool Ja are the only interesting tribe, with the whole blessed sibling plot, and sacrificing children to make a strong sibling to take the throne. \n\nMoreover, the rite of succession is worthless, since there is no competition all 3 of the competitors all either get disqualified, or disqualify themselves from the competition. It's just disappointment after disappointment, even when Thancred and Urianger are together, and the game hypes up this competition between you and them, it falls flat and doesn't even give you that. Thancred smashes a tree stopping you from moving further in a dungeon and you instantly find another path. That's the closest thing to competition, the rest of it is just collaborating (which defeats the entire point of this competition). \n\nAnd Finally, what makes the expansion worse is Wuk Lamat herself, the entirety of the expansion revolves around her, she is completely forced onto us and we are supposed to love her. It reads like a cringy self-insert of the author themselves, like Wuk Lamat actually feels like a FFXIV Wattpad fanfiction character, she lacks any depth, she just feels like a generic shonen protagonist (A shonen protagonist in a bad shonen also), we have to babysit her the entire time, she steals all the glory, the WOL doesn't interact with anyone and could just be invisible, and it's just not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1720291793, "timestamp_updated": 1720291793, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527714908123016357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169168659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986685048", "num_games_owned": 839, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I spoke to Wuk Lamat.", "timestamp_created": 1720290900, "timestamp_updated": 1723995755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493507206439971924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169164399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000667903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Foi bem bosta a hist\u00f3ria e o final tamb\u00e9m.\nNota 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1720287277, "timestamp_updated": 1720287277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169164106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998883309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat is one of the worst characters in video game history, ergh", "timestamp_created": 1720287030, "timestamp_updated": 1720287030, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442336887121200562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169162082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038185736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Listen, the battle content in this expansion is fantastic.

She's a nice enough person but is very naive and stupid. She's also wholly unsuitable for the throne that we're supporting her claim for and doesn't grow. Also why we're doing that is beyond me. She is an uncompelling character and is incredibly forced, even moreso than Minfilia. With Minfilia, Lyse etc, you at least spend time with other characters, but in Dawntrail you cannot get away from Wuk Lamat. Every time you split up, you're paired with her. She's shoehorned into everything. Everyone talks about every situation in relation to her. You're known only for being her attendant. She also hogs the spotlight in every situation, including bosses, and then gets the credit too. It was already bad enough half way through but they will cram her down your throat until you're sick of her and then keep going. The story was crap as is but she just drags it down even further. I hate Wuk Lamat and never want to see her again. \n\nOrdinarily, I go through the MSQ wanting the see what happens next. This time, I just wanted it to be over. Can't explain much without spoilers, but I found the story got worse as it went along and just fell flat. It was marketed as a fresh adventure, with Krile getting focus along with Erenville. We get no adventure and the stakes escalate too high. The WoL serves no purpose in the story: we just cheer Wuk Lamat on and do labour for her. We could easily be deleted along with the Scions, who are there just to make up the numbers when they appear at all. Krile and Erenville get very limited focus and their stories, whilst decent for what little we get, fall flat because Wuk Lamat eats up all the screentime. She has more dialogue than Erenville and all the Scions combined and most of it is just repeating the same crap.

The jobs/reworks as well are pretty solid for the most part.\n\n          MSQ... After over a decade of world building, Dawntrail forsakes all of that. Now you're no longer the mc, Wuk Lumat who I personally don't dislike as a character, but her narrative takes the leading role and does virtually nothing to show for it. We're coming into Dawntrail after a universe ending threat, with not even a word of acknowledgement, nor does the WoL get any recognition. We & the former Scions do all the work, but get none of the recognition, as it all goes to Wuk Lumat. The pacing is so incredibly slow, the story doesn't feel as if it's started until the end of zone 6, by then you've already sunk 20 hours of fetch quests and babysitting Wuk, just not engaging content and can go literal hours between any fights, even in world. Zone 5 was solid, but it felt as if it needed to be introduced sooner, as well as the characters with it, the story clearly wants you to empathize and get attached to some characters and yet... They're simply too shallow for us to care. Most notably, Queen Sphene, who's written in a way similar to Emet Selch. Had we been given more time to empathize with her and her goals, although her efforts are just prolonging the inevitable, we might be more inclined to care for her. Sadly, it falls short. \n            Going into zone 6, It's built up to be this jump into the unknown, all the scions barring G'raha and Krile stay behind with the goal of protecting and keeping open the gate, from there on it is never once acknowledged of their efforts to keep it open nor any struggle, meaning it was all pointless. In zone 6 you learn of Krile's past & family, learn that perhaps we've learned our magic from another reflection or potentially somewhere else even in a passing comment from G'raha, and it's never acknowledged again. And finally... Erenville. Following the trope of sadness turning into anger, leading him to pout and act selfish for the entirety of zone 6 with his mother until finally it's her time to pass on. While understandable, it's frustrating and really solidified my disdain for the character. \n            The final fight, while fun, it fell short narratively. We go to confront sphene, and it's setup in a way not unlike the fight with the Endsinger. Where everyone is cast away but the WoL, and finally.. we're recognized for our strength. Like all major fights seemingly now, we use our scapegoat azem crystal and start the fight. About a third of the way into the fight, a phase transition occurs and magically Wuk Lumat is the only one that was cast away to find a crack and break free, and she proceeds to reach out to Sphene's character and tank the fight for us as the fight is about to end. We finish the fight, it sets up for us potentially to have access to use the gateway to travel into other reflections with the artifact, and then it fades to black and cuts out to us and the scions leaving the temple where the gate is kept. Then pans out into a celebrating Tuliyolall. That's it. That's the story. Compared to Shadowbringers & Endwalker, hell even Stormblood, this msq completely falls flat on its face. \n             I don't hate Wuk Lumat as a character, but with the scions being neglected, to shallow storytelling and character building for the new characters, as well as her outshining the WoL/MC it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Dawntrail was frustrating.\n\nTLDR: Content is engaging, story and world building is trying to start anew but ends up shallow and falls flat on its face, while completely disregarding over a decade of world building and story/characters. Above all, it's just sad to see a game that's brought some of my favorite experiences in gaming fall short on this scale. It feels like being spit in the face. Thanks for coming to my ted talk..

As a longtime avid player, there was no way I wasn't buying this expac, and the post msq stuff will have made the price worth it. But ultimately, while I tried to go into DT with low expectations, it really fell short for me.\n\nKeeping things vague, if you're going into this hoping to hang out with your fellow scions, play a meaningful role in the story, be a leader/guide to the actual main character Wuk Lamat (rather than mostly just being at her side), don't. You won't find it. Your time spent with fellow scions is minimal at best, and the way they are written feels awkward and untrue to themselves. They don't really grow as characters with one sort of exception, and frankly? Neither do you. \n\nI feel like I didn't learn anything, like I didn't grow. Wuk Lamat is a sweetheart, but all of the \"lessons\" they're trying to teach are so heavy handed and overdone that I grew resentful of it by the end. The pacing and story focus ruined the pacing of the final zone, as well as the stakes. We didn't need to be told information as explicitly and as often as we did, I felt like I was being babied. \n\nEverything up until ~96 was good enough. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. But the final parts were boring and filled with heavy handed story to the point I felt resentment. This expac wasn't just about the strength/meaning behind family, *every* character had *some* tie to family. Every character had stakes in the family pool to the point it felt ridiculous. No matter the stakes, sometimes you were forced to take your time and do silly things, even after having been told how important it is you take care of things quickly. \n\nThe music is fantastic. The areas are gorgeous. The combat is new and exciting, and the quality of life changes are beyond welcome.

Music, enviroment designs, character designs, dungeons and trials. All were truly amazing. Dungeons/trials difficulty compared to previous expansions was increased for normal story players, but had enough balance to keep them fun.\n\nHowever, sadly all of this greatness is wrapped in poorly written story, which very clearly is divided in 2 halfs. There might be small spoilers, but I will do my best to not spoil anything major. First half, is what I describe as Pokemon babysitter adventure. We go around Tural collecting \"gym badges\" and in essense watch over Lamat. However, its boring, extremly boring. She doesn't grow as a person, instead gets really weird power strikes for the sake of not involving us the player (Someone has to push the story forward, but we cannot do it, we can only stand next to her... idk why, just reasons) and every aspect of the first half is focused on extending the time we spend in the expansion. Even if halfs are relatively even, the first one seems like it will never end, because it literally is that boring, 10h in and you still won't encounter ANY fight.\n\nSecond half is much more interesting. Story seems more cohesive and actually attempts to involve the player into some action.  While Lamat is still quite prominent part of this half. We at least get some breaks from her, which you have to trust me... It was needed. Overall the second half could stand on its own and in my opinion too much attention was put into first half than the second one.  For me the story ratio should be 30% first half and 70% second half.. but well we got more like 60% first and 40% second. For obvious reasons I won't mention any characters that appear in second half. There happens a lot and got really disappointed when in last Trial Lamat rejoins the fight... even tho VERY CLEARLY, She was \"KICKED OUT\" and they never explained how she was able to do it... I guess sheer power of will can override \"Code\"\n\nOverall I would rate the first half as 3/10. Really boring and uninspired piece of writting. While second half as 6/10 or even 7/10. \n\nScions for once were totally useless.. but THEY HAD TO, include them. Like ALL OF THEM. We didn't need them, they didn't do that much and they feel extremly forced into this expanion... Same with certain flying creatues from previous expansion... I guess SE has different definition of break/vacation...\n\nI am leaving a negative review, but I still have hope. We still have 2 years worth of content to get. Maybe, just maybe the content prepared in future updates will be that much better that would somehow explain poor writting of the first half, which really tainted my overall experience. I am still waiting for my vacational adventure, I hope post DT questline will focus more on it and if it does, I will comeback and change my review.", "timestamp_created": 1720227501, "timestamp_updated": 1720227501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500997960567474365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169101868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095416688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "They were in fact not cooking on this one.", "timestamp_created": 1720225548, "timestamp_updated": 1720225548, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545517086982727051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169101203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058233830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently, the game has a lot of issues and it is progressively going more stale with every expansion - especially with the recently announced job changes. \n\nFirstly, the core of the game has more or less been unchanged for the last 10 years. If you look at low level dungeons vs high level dungeon there is virtually no difference besides different skin mobs; you will always do wall to wall pulls and same rotation. \n\nJobs are disappointing without end, get ready for your job to be butchered and made easier every expansion and complexity is out the window. Viper is a job that was released on this expansion, which is essentially the easiest melee job in the game. For a single target rotation with a few side buttons on a mouse you could most definitely play it with mouse only and one hand. Well, due to a minority complaining over the \"busyness\" of the class steps will be taken to make the easiest melee class even easier - as per their announcement on Lodestone. \n\nStory. The story is ok for a Final Fantasy story, however, it feels like 50% of the story is actual story while the other 50% are just fillers. I understand that this is supposed to have a vacation feeling, and I acknowledge that and enjoy that, however, the number of quests that are completely unnecessary are too many. They are also afraid of taking risks with the story and they are going with the tried and tested final fantasy story. Basically the usual friendship thing. Shadowbringers was a success because it did not have much of that, and it felt like there were stakes.\n\nWhile cinematic quality has greatly improved, it does feel like they are needlessly dragged on by lets say showing off the characters walking away while fading out on basically nearly every cinematic of which there are a lot. Or just zooming in on the characters faces while they have their neutral expression on... One by one... of which there are usually more than 6 characters. \n\nOverall, some improvement but overall a disappointment.\n\nUpdate: Viera most noteworthy feature are the long ears and people complained about them not being able to wear hats so they came up with a genius solution!

I recommend you switch to JP actors or mute the characters. You'll save yourself from the cringe. Wish I could share the suffering my chat expressed but I had logged off to give myself time to breath.\n\n\n\nStory is a mixed bag (I expected this...but):\nWhat kills it the most is the Wuk Lamat and is exacerbated by the ENG voice acting.\nWorse yet, this character will be in your face 90% of the time.\n\n[b][u]We all know that voice acting can bring a story to life even more or drag it into the mud.[/u][/b]\n\nThe acting is so horrible that I changed to JP voice (never have done this with other games btw) and BOY is the difference night and day. There's soul in the character with JP voice acting. Pain, hurt, cries, shouting, nervousness, you know, the quality you would expect from FF14. However it genuinely blows my mind that there have been so many other characters introduced and were done well, some better some worse, but... this? Library voice when shouting is needed. Flat when emotional despair is needed. Plain when fighting for your life is needed. Disinterested when nervousness, insecurity, and a little trembling is needed.\n\nWhat happened?\nMy theories:\n1 - The voice acting directory failed to inform the voice actor what to do or the voice actor couldn't deliver/isn't experienced enough, which I highly doubt it otherwise the director would have done something about it. \n2 - That or the director couldn't do anything about it because HR refused to find someone else.\n3 - The person above the voice acting director said you'll work with what you got.\n\nI don't know and I don't care. \nDon't get me started on the useless drivel that is the drama surrounding the VA irl. I discovered it after I had my opinion formed and I wish I could bleach my eyes from all the childish nonsense I bore witness to. \n\nAll I know is that the ENG voice actor seriously kills everything, yes, up to the point of impacting the delivery of the story. People are comfortable enough to voice it in game that's how bad it is, which has never happened during my time since ARR. I really hope they either refine the ENG voice actor, change the actor or abandon Wuk Lamat, one of the three. \n\nWhat I do know is that whom ever thought this performance was okay to ship, needs to be disciplined if not fired. \n[b][u]Doing this to a Side Character is one thing. Doing this to a Lead Character is the most unprofessional decision I've ever seen.[/u][/b]\n\nOther than that:\n-- It's stormblood levels of writing (AKA world building focused) which I expected, but the world building is weaker and more shallow.\n-- Overall plot is nice but could and should have been more in depth.\n-- Problems that shouldn't exist do and the resolution is no less frustrating.\n-- First phase of the story was okay (5/10). Plenty of obvious stuff but not the end of the world. \n-- Second Phase was better but not by much (7/10). Wish this stuff had more time to marinate and cook but the writers just speed through this. This could have been so much better.\n--  First and Second phase of story could be expansions in their own right if the writers cared enough to give complexity, nuance, growth and marination.\n\n[b][u]THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE. HOW WAS THIS LESSON NOT LEARNED IN STORMBLOOD?[/u][/b]\n\n-- There are characters that say the same line over and over and it's becomes annoying at times. \n-- The expression of insecurities and such need to be different instead of the same text given.\n-- Character development is poor for almost everyone. Erenville's growth is probably the only satisfying one.\n-- ENG va is poor. Performance of the past is what I expected, but it's stiff all around, wuk lamat isn't the only one with problems but she is the worst of the bunch.\n-- Music is a delight but, that's subjective of course. Two of them seriously reminds me of megaman and kingdom hearts 2.\n-- Zones are a treat for the eyes.\n-- The Lore drops a TON of threads for the team to pull from and for fans to theory craft (2nd phase of the story though. 1st one has nothing). \n-- Speak to Wuk Lamat. Accept Wuk Lamat. Be with Wuk Lamat. Become Wuk Lamat. \n-- You will get the Ishikawa emotional damage moments but there's a lot less here so temper expectations significantly. (ishikawa isn't in charge from what I hear which is mildly surprising that this is the result of whatever happened in the office)\n-- dialog options may leave you frustrated more often than not.\n\nEdit: adding/adjusting items as I give myself more time to think about everything.

Build up all that excitement and sneak peaks for the new expansion just to put on my reading glasses on minute one. Annoying, but this is still the least annoying aspect of the expansion for me.\n\nMy main complaint, Wuk Lamat. Yes I am aware of all the drama going around, but this is not related to it. What is annoying is that the writing of this character. At first it was a cute and interesting journey but oh boy did she become annoying quick. During all of the trials, we and rest of the scions that carried her. She has no outstanding power compared to anyone in the scions yet she gets to be the front \"power\" during the second half of the expansion? Sphene's intention was to devour whole Eorzea, not just Tuliyollal. Lets drag a lion pup with us into battles and act like she is capable of holding herself and give the microphone during the few voiced scenes. With that here comes my second major complaint.

After the subpar patch story I already went into this expansion's MSQ with somewhat low expectations but this was not subpar, the writing was just straight up awful.\n\nThey promised adventure, vacation and friendly competition with your companions and you get nothing of that. You are chained to Wuk Lamat at virtually all times to complete the success ritual and to \"learn about the people of her continent\", but you better don't expect any of the moving, personal character stories of past expansions a'la Inn at Journey's Head or Garlemald - Dawntrail has nothing of that. In praxis you are solving every minor inconveniences for the useless princess until she goes \"Yay, the power of peace and friendship\" and then you literally solve the region's generation-long blight with a single link pearl call. And this keeps happening at a completely predictable and excruciatingly slow pace where you sometimes not see any combat for hours - not even regular trash mobs- and there is nothing even close to memorable solo missions like Endwalker's Thancred infiltration or In From The Cold.  The \"villians\" are also a complete joke, they are  saturday-noon cartoon level evil with complete nonsensical motivations and the only reason the plot advances at all is because the WoL just watches while they go on with their antics. And after that joke of an arc was over (at level 86) they have the audacity to throw in an entire area disconnected from the plot for padding - but it's the only time in the entire game where you get a break from Wuk Lamat so that's an upside I guess.\n\nBut the thing that agitates me the most is the fact that there *is* great writing in there, it's just completely undercooked and jammed together in the final area. The Golden City itself  is an incredibly fascinating premise and it would have been awesome to spend more time with it's inhabitans and explore the ethics of their situation - this is where they easily could've told some absolutely heart crushing stories and better develop their main villain. Instead the entire ending felt incredibly shoehorned in and rushed and it felt like they had a checklist of things they need to get over quickly. I mean we spent more time on a damn taco recipe than we did in the resolution of the biggest character arc of a companion that was with us since 2.0, it's just unacceptable. *This* should've been the core of the expansion and easily deserved 2-3 more areas that were instead used in that padded garbage succession arc and it just felt like a slap in the face.\n\nAt least the duties are good, I guess", "timestamp_created": 1720207817, "timestamp_updated": 1720207817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526723504066467285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169083378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087343707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "french", "review": "De loin la pire extension de tout FF14, en terme d'histoire j'entend, c'est pas \"Dawntrail\" qu'elle aurait du s'appeler l'extension c'est \"Wuk Lamat\" !!

It's that several mainstay characters are left with nothing of value to contribute to this exciting new chapter in the story, included almost solely to prop up new characters that are just plain uninteresting and flat. It's that every time it reaches a peak, and it starts to actually get some intrigue going, it drops the ball for several hours afterwards.\n\nIt's disappointing, too, because everything else is [i]fantastic[/i].

Ultimately I think the ARR beast tribes, especially the Sahagin and Kobold relationships with Limsa Lominsa were more interesting.\n\nWuk Lamat is fine at the start but quickly becomes a Shonen Protagonist one trick pony that never stops talking.

Honestly what this feels like after seeing it all, I have no proof of AI being used to upscale their textures but it very much feels like this with so many issues within the gear, skin, eyes.\n\nQuality of game 3 | 10\n- Tons of exploits on the maps for the new zones, like zero QA. There are even missing textures in certain areas.\n\n- PS5's are crashing when playing the game on 60 FPS | The only fix for them is to literally turn the games graphics down to 30 FPS a console should not be overheating, they even overheat with a deep and thorough cleaning. Xbox players literally could not play the game when transitioning between areas, its really bad. People who own 3080's even struggle to run the game. You also can't turn off bloom which is causing people to get headaches.\n\n- The Story is a slog in the beginning which is okay to me since it's a brand new story we need world building sure, but it isn't very engaging for a lot of players which I find is true. Players need substance to be more engage other than just text and cutscenes.\n\n- Spoilers on story below -\n- The story has so many unanswered questions that are essential to the world building, where they could have fleshed out more. Like this could have been the good filler instead of the beginning world filler honestly. Instead you literally have to remind Wuk Lamat what her \"purpose\" in life is several times when its like dude, how many times we have to tell you to believe in yourself, and believe in peace. I understand maybe once or twice sure but shes asked this so many times... \n\nThen the plot changes REALLY FAST like beyond fast, the narrative is very jarring and semi-confusing on what exactly happened. When half the story and of purpose was to help Wuk Lamat become Dawnservant which is fine. After we help her become this she has to follow us after to help her nation, when in reality she should have just been left behind to defend her own country with her brother and just have the WoL + Eren + Krile for the rest of the expansion Wuk Lamat did not have to come with us on this added adventure her purpose for the narrative should of been to just become their leader and that's it. Literally she kept self inserting herself into OUR adventure. I understand her Father dies and her Brother does want her to Duel him, to prove herself and to prove himself to be a better ruler, but still after this duel her story should of ended. The Scions literally showed up as well, and did really nothing for the story, they had zero personality traits to them, while on the hand other Einstein literally was a chad the entire adventure and had a more epic adventure. \n\nThe last 3 zones of the story are really good, until of course Wuk Lamat, literally cannot leave the WoL's sight for even a minute. To even bring it all together the last zone is very good, can be very emotional, sure but it is a kinda cheap cry out scene I agree, but honestly it really is an Amaurot 2.0. It is absurd to force narrative on people to cooperate, find peace, and settle their differences when, literally everything we learned and did means nothing. Wuk Lamat can understand that things aren't always the way they are, but it really felt like she didn't learn anything at all. She even comes back into the Finale, ruining the last boss encounter. \n\n- Overall Story Score is a 3 | 10\nHonestly ARR was better than this.

Trials may have had the most improvement, and have interesting visual tells for almost every mechanic. The team has very clearly found how hectic they want fights to be, as the pace remained fairly consistent since the first trial, including dungeon bosses. \n-\nMOST of the job changes and improvements have been nice (I'm so sorry monk players you didn't deserve what happened to you) and visually the abilities have all been pretty solid. Specific praise to the tank mitigation upgrades, it lends more identity to each, and is a correct step towards job individuality. In terms of new jobs, Pictomancer is outstanding, and has a nice depth where your ability to find downtime in a fight is rewarded. It will be a favorite for high level play. Viper is very simple, but fun. It will (probably) be one of the most popular jobs in the game much like summoner. Only concern for Viper is that higher ping players may not enjoy it as they feel they are missing inputs.\n-\nMusic has been pretty alright compared to other dlcs, the only real standouts were one of the town themes (night), two dungeons near the end of the dlc, and one boss theme. The raids have yet to be released, so this one is subject to have positive additions.\n-\nAnd finally the controversial character, Wuk Lamat. Putting aside all politics, she is not well written at all. She is a gimmick character that they gave a full story for. If you like that, power to you. Personally I believe she is very one note, and hope shes a one-and-done dlc character. Probably going to get put on a stake for it but I feel its enough of a talking point that it needs to be mentioned, as she is a MAJOR part of this dlc, if not the entire thing.\n-\nThis is a good stepping stone, but this is not a good dlc. This is a payed content update. I have high hopes for future patches in regards to the story, and hope that they further adjust the jobs to feel truly unique from one another.

The quest design is borderline visual novel at this point.\n\nThe two new jobs are cool additions, but the overall job design still continues to suffer from being overly simplistic.

Its not bad, just okay.\n\n- 90-100 Role Quests\nThe new level 100 role quests however are extremely hit or miss depending on the one you do. Most of these quest are not enjoyable to play through. Only one of the quests had kept me interested but that isn't a great ratio.\n(played through all but one)\n \n-Characters: \nThe new characters are fun. There are a few times were the characters did some things that didn't really make sense/didn't act when they should have to be believable but its not a huge problem.\n\nWe do feel like a babysitter sometimes but that's kind of the point. We are bodyguards, not this story's main character. \nSome players may not take well to having so little impact in the story yet and that shows in some other reviews. And that's perfectly fine. Player characters have been the focus for so long it\u2019s bound to ruffle feathers when they aren't anymore. And some may not enjoy the change that we have gotten to the style of story being told now. \n \n-Antagonists: \nWithout saying too much; they kind of feel like high school bullies rather than threats at the start, and the story has no real weight because of it. There isn't an obvious or reasonable need for our character to be there bar being a guard dog (changes later), and that makes it hard to form an attachment or sense of purpose for the player to be drawn into the story. (not referring to our playable character) \nThis changes later but the start of the expansion is slow as a result. \nThings intensify way too late in the story and the threat isn't even really treated as a threat near the end. You get very mixed signals from this expansion.\n \n-The game play: \nSo far, I am having a really good time with the actual interactive content (dungeons etc.) they are fun and engaging but a portion of the gear that drops as loot in the dungeons and/ or trade-able gear is recolours of old gear from past expansions. The dungeons are very spread out as well which means it takes quite a while to get to them. \nRecolours in and of themselves aren't a bad thing when done in small amounts, but there are very few *new* gear pieces that have been created for the expansion. It's almost all recoloured (so far). Previous expansions had nearly all unique gear for just about everything. Dawntrail does not continue that trend. \n \nI love the difficulty increase in normal content as an experienced player but I have seen a fair few players struggle a little while getting used to it. \n\n- Daily Content\nHowever... I'm not enjoying doing dailies (daily roulette's) as they took out the lvl 90 and Expert dungeon roulette's (expert added back in after completion), which means its extremely rare to even get to play your favourite classes at the higher levels because the majority of the content is extremely low level dungeons and trails that appear the most frequently. So day to day play has taken a hit in enjoyably for more experienced players.\n\nHaving both expert and level 90 roulette separate was not great but just lumping those higher  level dungeons and trials into the same roulette with level 51+ content honestly is worse.\nMerging them means that daily content is quicker to complete though which is important for players that have less time to play everyday, which is good.\n \n \n- Environments: \nMusic= great \nAreas= beautiful \n \nThis is a part of the review that I felt I had to change a significant amount after reaching the second hub city of Dawntrail (Solution 9). \nIm noticing a growing trend of the environment team for finalfantsy14 making these stunning places and towns but then leaving them empty. (very little actual reason to go there due to a lack of market board for major cities more specifically Solution 9 or just NPCs to talk to or just see walking around).  \nSolution 9 is the biggest example of this. It has a massive map to traverse but no real reason to. The only place that has a purpose is the scrip exchange area. The rest of the zones are either completely empty with basically no NPCs (interactable or otherwise) or have a few NPCs dotted around but none have any sort of purpose. It doesn't feel like a bustling city, it feels like an empty shell.  \nSomething so stunning being so empty and lifeless was a real shock to me. \n \nThe second \u201chub zone/city\u201d in Shadowbringers; Eulmore seems to be built on the same principle as Solution 9 with market boards and stuff like that so perhaps it's intentional. ? \n \nTulliyollal was much the opposite, having a smaller map most of the spot's players need/can use are center stage and the rest of the area is small and fun to traverse even if there is no reason to. (would have loved more than one market board but that's personal preference) It feels more alive than its counterpart.  \n \n \n- Graphical Update: \n \nThe developers did a great job with the update; the lighting and effects look wonderful. The character updates are hit or miss depending on the person in question that you ask but they are never problematic and can be solved easily due to the developers giving you a way to change your character for free if you don't like the changes to your character. \n\n- New Classes:\nViper got changed almost immediately after i got it to max lvl. They ruined the jobs fun factor after the changes because people were complaining about its difficulty. \nThey took the *poison* out of the snake(viper)class? They effectively took the only thing in the jobs kit that made it interesting (it was a buff you had to keep up, similar to a DOT); now its a \"click button when flash\" class. I'm glad i got to play it while it was still fun at least but other players have lost that chance.\n\nPictomancer is a really fun class, its dmg is crazy, especially for a class that's made for a more fun loving clientele. Its novelty fell off fairly quickly for me but I'm sure a lot of players still love that the job exists. Square certainly does as it is still yet to be nerfed as of the edit to this review.\n \n- Conclusion: \nIts hard to give a full review right now and most of this is subject to change but I do recommend the expansion so far.  \nI just feel like the quality isn't there right now. In a way it feels a little bit rushed. Things could (as always) have been paced better and refined more. \nThis expansion heavily focuses on wowing the player base with visuals but not much else as of right now.  \nI genuinely believe that the lack of new/interesting gear is a large downgrade from previous expansions as of right now. \nI still love the game and its player base, I only voted no as most of my thoughts on the matter right now are mostly of mild concern rather than positive. \n \n \nAs always, please go and play through it for yourself and formulate your own opinions.

Instead, we're given a series of predictable events and bland dialogue that do little to engage the player. The new characters introduced in Dawntrail are forgettable at best, and their motivations are either clich\u00e9d or poorly explained.\n\nThe pacing is another major issue. Key moments that should be thrilling or emotionally charged fall flat due to poor execution and a lack of build-up. The quests are repetitive, making the already tedious story feel like a chore to slog through. Even the cutscenes, which have often been a highlight in previous expansions, seem overly long and filled with needless exposition.\n\nIn short, the Dawntrail expansion's story is a significant letdown.

I avoided spoilers. \n\nFor the parts that I could tolerate so far in this expansion, the primary focus is this boring, bland, and not even appealing-to-look-at character whose voice feels like someone took a dentist drill to my ears. Everything in this character's story is predictable and honestly fits into your average old Tumblr (yeah, going way back) fanfiction writer with daddy issues. I've barely begun the expansion and am being told, \"she grows on you,\" but the further I progress, it's more like a bloody tumor than a quirky bipedal cat creature.\n\nI see attempts at counterarguments being \"You are just mad that your character is not the main focus or main character blah blah blah blah blah,\" which puzzles me. Even in Stormblood, you weren't sidelined when a lot of the focus was on Lyse. I don't understand this terrible attempt at a counterpoint. One of the reasons I hated WoW was that your character was pretty much nameless; in cutscenes, you weren't even there. You were part of \"a group of adventurers.\" What drew me to Final Fantasy was that the character you created was a focal point of the world. I didn't feel like I was just playing an MMO.\n\nWith this expansion, I have the same feeling that I had when I played WoW. Your character is being relegated to support in a subpar story for an awful character whose terrible VA cannot display emotion outside of sadness and crying properly while doing a fake accent.\n\n(Seriously, listen to when the character tries to display \"Anger\"; I honestly thought I was listening to ARR voice acting for a bit there.)\n\nWhy wouldn't I want this character that is my character in an RPG, \"ahem,\" let me say that again, an RPG, to be part of the main focal point of the story? That's all I got for now; it's just so boring storywise and lacks any of the same wonder that post-ARR expansions had. It's not just because it's an entirely new arc; it's genuinely bad, in my opinion.\n\nSide Note: There is nothing in this expansion that fits into, ugh, the blanket word that essentially means nothing, \"woke.\" The character who is the main focus is just insufferable. I shouldn't have to state this, but with anything that's popular, that stupidity crops up every time.\n\nI also shouldn't have to state this either, but this is just my opinion; hence why I used the word \"I\" a lot in this review.

She's the main character and you're there to follow her, it's her story and you better get used to it cause 34 out of 100 quests are given by her. A majority of quest objectives go \"Talk to Wuk Lamat. Talk to Wuk Lamat again.\" You get one region without her and as someone who doesn't like her it was by far the most enjoyable because it felt like you were finally getting to adventure yourself.\n\n\nNow for the spoilers:\n\nGood:\n- Each environment was beautifully designed, it was great to ride around in.\n- Music for the last few zones were great. End credits didn't really fit but neither does this expansion\n- New jobs are fun, Pictomancer especially for me\n- Armor sets given to you during the story all look great aside from the last one which is a recolored Ironworks gear\n\nBad:\n- Solution 9 was shown early on and should have been a surprise. Also the plot of the \"Scions being against each other\" is bullshit cause Koana and Wuk Lamat work together most of the time anyway\n- Rides or dies based on how you feel about Wuk Lamat, she's basically Steven Universe where she loves everyone and tries to use the power of love to make everyone get along. Her \"growth\" is going from a royal kid that loves everyone to a ruler that now understands why she loves everyone. Voice didn't fit for me but that's always assumed to be a voice director problem i.e. Riku in Kingdom Hearts 3\n- Story was painfully predictable. Wuk Lamat would become leader but need Koana to be \"resolve and Reason\" like their dad, the cheating Bakool Ja Ja actually has a sad backstory and thats why he's cheating, the warmongering Zarool Ja goes evil when he loses and becomes the antagonist for like 5 hours and then Sphene who you just met but not actually Sphene because she's technically just an AI and who cares at this point\n- You will watch this expansion more than you will play it, it's safest to assume each time you talk to an NPC you're getting a cutscene and it doesn't matter if you just got out of a cutscene. Most of which have Wuk Lamat preaching at you or giving a speech about how much she loves her people. Just skip them cause you'll already know whats happening\n- Dungeons are formulaic now, 2 packs of 2-4 mobs followed by a mini boss twice, then 2 packs of 2-4 mobs followed by the final boss. Only actually interesting thing are the environments and learning what the bosses do\n- Ignoring the fact the final area is yet again an area for specifically the memories of the dead (The Tempest, Ultima Thule, and now the lazily named Living Memory) the entire story of it is pointless. You're there to shut down terminals that kill off The Endless, so instead of just getting it over with Wuk Lamat decides for everyone that you all need to listen to The Endless and help them to understand why Sphene loves them so much. Then after that you kill The Endless in that area and go onto the next. Stupid.\n\n\n\nUltimately I think it's the worst expansion, I think if it just cut out Wuk Lamat's rite shit entirely and gave more focus to Sphene trying to preserve her people then the expansion would have been more enjoyable and a lot shorter.

There is nothing engaging about talking back and forth between  5 NPCs to get information that could have been summed up in one conversation. There is nothing engaging about going around right clicking on a banana peel on the ground and then going back to once again talk to an NPC. It is neither good storytelling nor good gameplay.\n\nIt is not a valid argument to say that this is okay because every expansion has done it the same way. If there is no improvement to how something is done over the course of a literal decade, that is not okay. It is just laziness or a reluctance to innovate.\n\nFor example, without going into spoilers, there is a segment of the game where it is the group's task to cook a special dish. We do not do anything for this except go around talking to NPCs. We have dozens of cooking animations because Culinarian is a class that exists. We could have easily had a mini game to cook the dish in this scenario. Instead, we have nothing interesting to do as usual.\n\nThere are countless moments in the story where literally anything interactive could have been implemented, but instead you just talk to NPCs. The MSQ feels more like a visual novel than a video game.\n\nThe dungeon and trial design has improved since the last expansion, but there is an ungodly amount of tedium in between content like this. It is a shame, because the zones are nice and the music is good too. But it is unfortunately spoiled by very badly done questing design.\n\nClass design is also not great at the moment. Healers are still just one button spam rotation, and the dev team seems to pander to the lowest common denominator on changes in general.

Perhaps it's because my character isn't caught up on the Dawntrail story itself yet, but thanks to this thing called Youtube and people called Streamers, I know what happens already.

I was always huge into the lore, and loved the combat... until both story consistency AND combat content started jumping the shark at the end of Stormblood. As someone else previously posted:\n\n\"This expansion is a culmination of the FFXIV Community constantly censoring or bulling those with dissenting opinions and the and overworked understaffed Dev team.\"\n\nLet's start with the combat:\n\nCombat used to be fun. Now it has been simplified into the ground, to the point of being the opposite of fun. Combat now has hand-holding. I'm no \"try-hard,\" but all the jobs have now been neutered into the ground. The worst part? The dev team DOES NOT listen, hasn't in years, does the exact opposite of what is recommended to them in feedback, and at this point has resorted to outright making things up.\n\nViper - the new melee DPS job - has been hailed by many as being very fun. It's like what Monk used to be, back in Stormblood, but streamlined (Monk might as well have been thrown into a wood-chipper with how mauled and un-fun it is right now). Literally no one has a problem with it, and it's getting praised by people who normally wouldn't play a job like that. Earlier today, the dev team announced that there were complaints regarding its positional requirements (it literally has very few and is super simple), which nobody can verify the existence of since it seems to be universally loved. Both the NA and JP forums are on fire right now begging SE to not go through with further simplification as it'll kill what is really the only fun melee job left in the game.\n\nMind you, the expansion hasn't been out for even a week at the time of me writing this. Less than a week if you got in via early access, literally TWO DAYS for everyone else. NONE of those people have the job at max level with all the skills unlocked, so they don't even know what the rotation properly looks like. Monk mains begged and pleaded for several expansions straight to reverse course on the direction they took it in, had to wait until literally the end of the expansion cycle when it was too late anyway, and all that happened was it kept getting neutered each time when the salient complaint was \"they took away too much, put all that stuff back!\". But this thing has been officially out for all of two days and you're telling me that these complaints NOBODY can seem to verify are forcing them to take immediate action in the very next patch update, even though EVERYBODY is telling them \"No, no, for the love of God please don't do this\"?!\n\nThey won't listen. They never do. The combat you like will continue to get neutered worse and worse because they don't know what to do with the jobs. At this point, it might as well just be a visual novel with no combat at all. People are now starting to wake up to \"accessibility claims\" not actually being about making the jobs approachable, but to try and omit as much combat as possible for people who want to watch the story like an interactive drama. There's only one problem with that in Dawntrail...\n\n... the story this time around is terrible, and the apologists for past expansions no longer have that shield to hide behind. Combat is really the only saving grace to the game now, but outside of Viper's current, soon-to-be-further-simplified state, the gross majority of the playable jobs don't measure up to what they used to be back in Stormblood, which was the ideal state for most jobs in the game. \n\nHere's the Story part of my review:\n\nBack in Endwalker, they botched the conclusion to the story they were building up for a decade for no good reason, and didn't really set up for where they are going next. A lot of good lore built up around Heavensward and Stormblood completely thrown under a bus by bad, inconsistent writers who can't keep the story straight anymore, and wrote scenes like they were finishing each other's sentences but weren't in the same room as one another. The actual plot and words coming out of characters' mouths were ignored by cry-bullies who had the \"Yoshi-P can do no wrong and all who oppose him must be aggressively silenced\" attitude, because they could fall back on \"the feels,\". After Shadowbringers, the writers felt like they could get away with this and started pushing the envelope to see what they could do, and they pushed it too far with how the main saga of the game ended, making the cracks in the writing a lot more obvious to most people who enjoy the game for its story and actually pay attention to the lore that was touted to be oh-so-amazing. Most of them don't actually know the lore as well as they think they do, but the writing flaws were so obvious that even they were like \"what the hell is even this?\" and it was incredibly divisive. \n\nIn spite of this, some people still held onto the idea that it was an alright expansion. But now, Dawntrail comes out, and the story... well... what this tries to pass off as \"story\" is downright too tedious and boring for the first half, and then toward the end it just winds up being a bad ripoff of the Shadowbringers plot for no good reason.\n\nWe've been down this route before with this dev team. For all certain people in the community love to act like it's a small group of try-hards complaining... it isn't. Yoshi-P has been ludicrously out of touch with the players for years, and now that the game is winding down (there are at most two expansions left after this, given the number of job stone slots still available and the engine is so old at this point, creating development bottlenecks), it seems like the big grand adventure we were all so invested in went out with a whimper instead of a bang, and the problem is poor leadership. At this point, unless 90% of the current staff is fired and Naoki Yoshida is replaced, the Old Yeller that is FFXIV is nearing the point where it just needs to be put out of its misery.\n\nDon't give this your money. Plenty of people are going to quit over the upcoming changes. I quit for 4 years, came back for the ONE job that was actually fun to play, and literally in under a week, this crummy dev team shows us all once again they've learned nothing from past mistakes and don't listen to the people practically spoon-feeding them solutions to the problems it has.\n\nThis game needs to die. I say this not as a hater, but as someone who truly loved this game. It doesn't need to keep on suffering, it just needs to be put out to pasture and we need a different dev team to make a new Final Fantasy MMO. It's heartbreaking to see the current state of the game, a pale, broken shell of its former self. Please don't support its continued suffering.", "timestamp_created": 1720134003, "timestamp_updated": 1720213624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444602310657501221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "169011882", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986984910", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 192583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2158, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far the greatest stain in FF14's storytelling since its inception.

We spend so much time focused on one character (Wuk Lamat), that it detracts from other interesting stories that could have been told. Krile and Erenville aught to have been given as much screen time, since their stories are really the emotional core of the last chunk of the MSQ. Even if you like her at first, by the end you will be thinking, \"Why did she just show up out of nowhere to say 3 minutes of dialogue, can't we let the other characters breath a little?\"\n\n3/10\n\nGameplay:\nOn the other hand, we have the battle content. No lie, the dungeons, trials, extremes, they're all the best the game has ever seen. They are exceptional. Actual 10/10 content. Yet you must push through the main story to even access this content. \n\n10/10\n\nOverall:\nOther games, like the Bayonetta series, can get away with a bad story, because the story is just a little cutscene here and there, while the amazing gameplay is ever-present. In this game, the balance is the exact opposite, with hours of cutscenes and dialogue between each action input. This, unfortunately, does not allow the amazing gameplay to carry this expansion. Previous expansions had engaging stories to carry player interest through the MSQ, this one does not.\n\nI will probably edit this review to a Recommend at some point, either when the patch content starts to roll out, or if the reviews dip below 50%. It isn't a wholly negative experience, but the positives at this point just can't carry the negatives. Mixed is exactly an overall review score that fits.

At the end, when I\u2019ve finished msq, I will provide what I like. There isn\u2019t much. The music and locations are great. Haven\u2019t gotten picto and viper is still meh. Tons of damage but the rotation is brain dead. Dungeons and trials are great too.\n\nInitial thoughts lvl 92ish-\n\nViper is alright, but kind of lackluster and I dont know why. I leveled it to 90 to do MSQ and by the time I got there I wanted to go back to my DRK or SAM or RPR.\n\nI think its so funny how many people are upset with this MSQ because its boring. The entirety of FF14 MSQ is a fetch questing slog, through all expansions. At least this time they were honest that this expansion is a vacation and so I wasnt expecting there to be anything that crazy. So far MSQ is just as boring as its always been except this time its crystal clear that you, a god slaying champion, is the Scions delivery boy. Theres no reason to be helping Wuk Lamat and Im confused as to why we care that shes in charge of her country. Shes not exceptional in any way and as far as I can tell the only reason we feel she should lead is so that there isnt another war (which if we cared we should just be influencing Wuks brother who everyone seems to support rather than just blindly supporting this person weve known for a week). Literally every character is more interesting than Wuk. Also, why does Koana just look like a lvl 50 player character. Such a weird design choice. \n\nThe story should have been centered around Erenville, someone we met in the previous expansion. They could have kept basically the same plot except he takes Wuks place. He had been exploring Eorzea not interested in the kingship and then came back and found out his brother was about to start wars so he felt he needed to take part in his adoptive fathers game, with our assistance. I seriously do not understand why the story we got was what they came up with. God I could literally talk for hours about how untalented the writing teams of these AAA companies are. \n\nI also find it  funny people say this expac is too political...have you guys not been playing this game? The ENTIRE FF14 story arc has been about politics. What I do think is that Dawntrail fails at creativity when it comes to the politics. They blatantly say modern day PC tag lines like \"cultures should be respected\" which is like yeah obviously and it wouldnt fall so flat if we hadnt just spent several expansions killing people of a dozen other cultures, and their gods. FF14 has been great at grey area politics and Im not sure but I would guess that some DEI department got their grubby hands on this one because its not super in your face but its much more noticible than its ever been which is sad because I expect more from Square. You cant create a fictional location based heavily off of Hispanic cultures and then make the natives bipedal worm lizard people and then preach to me about respecting cultures. \n\nOne other thing Ill say is that the voice acting in this expansion has fallen off. Literally every NPC, whether they be human looking or a big fat bird person just sounds like hispanic americans. Its very unimmersive. Endwalker did the same thing with the Elephant race that just had Indian american accents. I feel like the VA direction is so boring - theres no creativity what so ever when it comes to creatures in this game anymore. It peaked at Midgarsormer. Im assuming this also falls onto some sort of DEI department. \n\nAll in all this expansion seems no different than the others other than that the stakes arent as high. And thats fine. I think SQENIX needs to fire whoever is Disneyfying this game - whoever is making blatant statements about real world modern politics. SHOW DO NOT TELL. This is such a basic rule for writing. Dont tell me whats good and bad. Show me whats good and bad and show me why. Not to mention, Im a grown adult. I dont need someone who works at a video game company telling me whats right and wrong. and to be clear, this is not a huge issue in the game but as I said above, its much more noticible and I feel like its only gunna get worse if its not talked about. Give these guys an inch and the next expansion will be about a bunch of gun wielding fat pig people who stole the land from a race of wolves. its just cringe and I know there are people out there who are talented enough to express their beliefs without preaching about it.\n\nEdit lvl 95: Zareel Ja puts it best: \u201cand what should she [Wuk Lamat] be rewarded for? Calling upon her minions to carry her victory?\u201d \n\nThe initial story is surprisingly awful-like the new Disney Marvel/Starwars projects. Upon starting the lvl 95 quests things begin to get interesting. There are some interesting themes sprinkled in but the vast majority of this expansion is embarrassingly adolescent. Wuk Lamat is boring and we literally do 90% of what she needs to do to be Dawnservant. This could have been three quests and an cutscene instead of drawing it out to 40. My biggest gripe though is the amount of plot holes. \n\n1. Oral Ja wants to start a war with Eorzea and it\u2019s mentioned several times in front of the Scions and we just..let him? I don\u2019t think we would kill him but you\u2019d think there\u2019s be some tension between the Scions who just spent 4 expansions in war and have killed dozens of gods, basically. But no. It\u2019s not really tackled at all in the first half of this msq. We just let this little lizard guy talk crap like he\u2019s not gunna get stomped on by us. \n\n2. Bakool Ja Ja kidnaps Wuk, tries to murder her, steals her keystone (that she\u2019s been collecting for the contest) and again, the Scions do nothing. It\u2019s not explained why Bakool is allowed to do all of this and not be disqualified while Zoraal Ja is disqualified for simply attacking a referee during a battle. Additionally, the entire Scions are allowed to assist Wuk in fighting her father, something required in order to win, while Zoraal had to do it alone. The rules are convoluted and written to make sense as to why the player character is here. It seems the writers just assumed we would be too caught up in the fun of fetch questing and making tacos that we wouldn\u2019t notice that the entire plot of this is an absolute mess. (Btw, this was said in another review but I\u2019m gunna echo it: we have an entire job that deals with cooking and there were two arcs about cooking food where we just run around and click sparkles on the ground. square needs to innovate their msq there\u2019s not excuse for that)\n\n3. Gulool Ja Jas brother [his conjoined twin] has been dead for three years and apparently this has zero effect on his health? Like his dead head has just been there, looking not dead. Not slouching. Not dangling. Just there like a normal head but with its eyes closed. I\u2019d think there would be some consequence of this as there is a dead head attached to his body but I guess I don\u2019t know the biology of large two headed lizard folk. Just seems like lazy writing. I think they could have  made this make sense by changing it to be that the brother had recently died and so Gulool needs to crown a new Dawnservant before he dies as a result of his body going into sepsis or something. This would add some real weight to what\u2019s going on. Instead, the story feels like something I\u2019d write in middle or high school on wattpad. \n\nOne other thing I\u2019ll throw out here is there are several scenes that are supposed to be serious but have jazz playing in the background. At one point you meet a treasure hunter and he gets killed (supposedly) and it cuts to black and the Jazz music starts. Another point Kriles echo sees Zoraal Jas future wars and she\u2019s having like a ptsd episode and again, the music is happy go lucky.

She doesn't bring anything to themes presented in 2nd half and even perspective she brings was based on events hours prior in msq which Imo doesn't earn her the right to speak up about it.

The story in Dawntrail is so infantile most of the MSQ script reads like an episode of the Pokemon anime show. It rethreads on a lot of themes and messages that were already covered in past expansions more than once, but in a more hamfisted way without much subtext to what message characters are supposed to convey.\nMost of your time as the Warrior of Light is spent babysitting a character that is essentially a repeat of Alphinaud and Lyse before they suffered their respective consequences for innocence idealism, and became better for overcoming it. Except this character doesn't really get challenged in that fashion at all... The entire world seems to bend to make sure Wuk Lamat doesn't NEED to change how she approaches things, ever.\nA lot of the new characters are very cartoony, with changes that happen too suddenly, or who don't get developed well at all, with the depth of a puddle.\n\nThey once again repeated the mistake of squeezing two stories into 1 expansion. As a result you have some of the most miserably boring experiences in XIV's history for the first 7 levels worth of MSQ, then a rushed and undercooked darker plot that gets resolved in the most Naruto-esque fashion.\n\nNone of the returning characters, aside from Krile and Erenville, get to be their own individual characters either. All Scions who show up are on auto-pilot and behaving like a hivemind or avatars to the mediocre writers. A couple moments are given for G'raha to introspect and give the kind of talk only he could do. Everyone else? Completely interchangeable, aside from the reasons they give to being there, which are arbitrarily picked by the scenario writers, with no weight on what they effectively do in the MSQ.\n\nSimply put the MSQ was tedious at best, trash at its worst. With few highs and a lot of drudgy lows.\n\nField zones are hit or miss as always. Dungeons are same old hallway simulators with trash mob to spam aoes and try not falling asleep. Music is great, better than Endwalker's. And boss fights are fun and pretty challenging... Except for the incredibly distracting text they now feature with some of the boss mechanics. The devs must have thought this would help more with telegraphing, but it only adds to the visual pollution.\nUnfortunately some of the postgame boss mechanics I found insufferable. Having recently played through all of Coils synced, what made those fights fun was the group coordination and complexity of how to HANDLE the mechanics. Current postgame in Dawntrail seems to prioritize covering every corner of the arena and outside of the arena with shit to look at and rotate the camera 360 degrees, and sometimes even apply a \"brilliant\" design of using orange markers to avoid on orange ground.\n\nThis expansion has killed my interest to unsub for a little while, assuming they improve things. If the MSQ is going to keep subtext and mature writing out like it has shown to since 6.1, and the cap-level mechanics are going to be a visual pollution mess, and you're not interested in the lifesim stuff, I don't think XIV is currently worth playing beyond the end of 6.0's storyline.\n\nThere are lot of single-player games better than what this tries to do as one. Easy 'don't recommend'.\n\nAnd by the way I spent around 44 hours on Dawntrail.

Gameplay is the same old and isn't covered too heavily.[/h3]\n\nI started the journey thinking Wuk Lamat is an okay, honest character that simply tries to put up a brave face to prove herself. This continued to be through the story... which became an issue halfway through it, as after our main task ends and we finally have as-small-as-they-come stakes story reminiscent of the promises of the vacation that I would love!... just to so we are reintroduced to a next big thing and our big cat friend is put back into our party and into every cutscene forward due to a convenience of her brother existing. Glad I get to hear 10 more jokes about her being sea-sick and how peace is good!\nSide note: I play with JP voice acting. Everyone did a good job.\n\n[i]That said, I didn't dislike learning about the cultures of the New World. It was somewhat cozy, even through the whole Trials part felt whatever to me and I somewhat-correctly predicted how it would end. I could definitely come up with an alternate story but this is not a place for it.[/i]\n\nSecond half goes over lessons we learned in the first half, that is: Death. Which seemed a bit too quick to bring up. Not to mention death was also a big element in two prior expansions. Sadly, this isn't the only thing the story keeps reiterating. We get a bit of world building for second to last zone, and defeat the bad guy. But oops, everything is at stake again, we are risking entire dimensions! Vacation? Low stakes? Building up a bad guy that will drive us like Zenos did? [i]SIKE![/i] \n[spoiler]And then we get put into the very last zone, an Amaurot-lite: a mix of Venice, [b]an amusement park[/b], hot springs and a botanical garden. I want to applaud writers for putting an amusement park into an amusement park MMO.[/spoiler]  The whole zone dragged here for too long and I for the first time in my XIV history, I wished it to be over already. Many things simply didn't make sense here: [spoiler]We are pretty much on a timer here but we hang out like nothing is happening[/spoiler] and [spoiler]the ignorant psychological torture from one of our party member's mothers[/spoiler]. I felt tortured as well, as I was literally fetching ice-cream cones in a main quest. In the final zone of the expansion. With the threat of the end of the world looming above my head. What. The. Fuck.\n\nCome final trial, we stand against it, alone, and using the Azem crystal TM we do the usual and use duty finder. Sadly the writers thought they could be clever and had our furry friend jump in mid transition and burst last 20% of the boss down for us. I was just so tired of her at this point, even through as I said, I started the journey being totally chill with her.\n\nAnd the final cutscene isn't even voice acted save for the final line, just like few other important dialogues in the main story.\n\nGameplay wise, I felt robbed of many opportunities for duty quests (that means the single player encounter fights). From ones we got: one felt awesome and I could imagine my WoL enjoying it as much as I did; one felt like a plothole and one had weird pacing issues with a meh choice for the final boss. We even get a much worse version of Thancred's stealth mission from EW, as a trail quest. There are two big points in the story where we should had played as our friends, but instead we just get a cutscenes during which we just stand in the back.\n\nDungeons felt good. As a midcore tank player (dunno how else to call myself if I do more things than casual players but don't do end game?) I felt like the difficulty was good. And the final trial packs a lot for something to be attempted blind, which is good! We need harder content in MSQ! And post-story dungeons are apparently pretty good as well (at the time of the writing, I went to do hardcore gathering instead of doing these for now).\n\nRandom thing, but I really wish they haven't teased Solution 9 at all, to make things more exciting, but oh well, gotta hook people on more things than just a new adventure in the MMO they like.\n\nNow something a bit subjective: OST wise only few tracks really stood out to me, that being Solution 9's theme, Vanguard's theme and level 99 trial. I would add Tuliyollal to the mix, but the day theme's loop takes forever to get going and gets old quickly when teleporting around. Aside of that, BGM ranges from okay to annoying. It is thematic, sure, but not my cup of tea and a certain Rak'tika-from-LIDL and the very final zone (and a custom BGM that plays during one FATE there) just made me go listen to songs from the prior expansions instead.

Unfortunately I ended up skipping many of the last cutscenes simply because I was fatigued by how little there was to gain from them, based on 90% of the earlier ones.

They finally got me interested and they blew it.\n\nI don't mind my character not being the center point of the story. I don't need a looming doomsday plot. The stakes don't need to be high for a good story. Just make it interesting, and stop repeating the same sappy \"Friendship conquers all\" concept every single cut scene.

The story feels much less mature, and every single time something happens, you get 10 minutes of everyone explaining to you what's going on. \"This means that, and that means this\", yes, I know..\n\nThen there are the characters. I actually liked Wuk Lamat at the start of the expansion, but I can honestly say that I now LOATHE her. She's a one dimensional character with a catch phrase that never evolves into anything.

The dungeons and trials both have had new and interesting mechanics that make me look forward to later raids.\n\nWhat I don't care for is some of the class changes; like Machinist feeling much slower to play than it used to be but Dragoon has become much more manageable. The music has been also been a mixed bag, as it was not nearly as impactful as Endwalker and Shadowbringers but has some genuinely good tracks mixed in with a lot of unremarkable ones. The voice acting has also been comparatively disappointing so far, but something which can be easily overlooked.\n\nWhat I lament is the expansion's story. This should come as no surprise to anyone who's been reading the reviews. I won't talk about Wuk Lamat and the power of friendship only because it's already been so thoroughly touched upon already. Instead, I will add a few other points that I've noticed that finally led to my writing of this review.\n\nTLDR: The primary fault of several of our new characters is that they are made out to be something at the start and turn out to be something completely different later on. You cannot promise something and then fail to deliver, or go back on said promise. \nDawntrail's story fell to a low I haven't viscerally felt since A Realm Reborn; it was hackneyed and in some cases senseless.\n\n[h3]  Spoilers, you have been warned... [/h3]\n\n[u]Characters[/u]\n\n[spoiler] 1. Bakool Ja Ja was poorly written because he's made out to be a thoroughly evil character from the start, even going as far as to release a Turalian primal for the sake of obtaining the throne. He laughs as he's releasing said fiend and explicitly commenting that he looks forward to the death and devastation the creature would bring, only to later have a COMPLETE 180 degree turn after being thoroughly bested. Not by you, mind, but by Wuk Lamat... [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] 2. Sphene, Queen of \"Reason\" in Alexandria. What we have here seems to be an immortal Mary Sue, though I am not certain who is self-inserting themselves into her role. Everyone seems to have some sort of unconditional love for her for reasons that are not apparent to me outside of \"she talks to us\", which did very little good when the tyrant of the tale decides it's time to kill everyone. She can occupy and fully control whichever mechanical mannequin she would like on a whim. By all available evidence, she could have embodied any number of the metal marionettes and used their capabilities to defend her people at no real risk to herself, yet she doesn't. When a story battle commences, she sticks around for reasons unknown instead of leaving, which puts her in danger of some kind. Otis, her long lost guardian, is killed in action trying to protect her yet he knew full well that she is virtually immortal. Otis' sacrifice could have been prevented in its entirety if Sphene simply left or allowed her occupied body to be destroyed; as far as we players know, it's not as if she could die anyway. From the moment I saw her garish outfit, watched her mannerisms, and heard her voice I was reminded of Ryne from Shadowbringers, a character who is emotionally driven and far too eager to please. This is a glaring, not endearing, flaw which tends to make associating with such a character far more trouble than it's worth; and I have no choice to disassociate myself with such a character. At least Ryne had the excuse of being young, inexperienced, and idealistic. Sphene has had centuries of conflict and tragedy to reflect upon, yet she's no better for it, which leads me to believe that she is willfully ignorant. As it stands, Sphene is not worthy of her title and I have seen little evidence to suggest otherwise. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] 3. Zoraal Ja, the main antagonist of the game, was made out to be a competent stoic leader with misguided intentions at the start of the expansion, but then somehow spending 30 years in a time bubble made him into a bloodthirsty imbecile. As King of Alexandria what he could have and perhaps should have done was confiscate the 'accounts' of the civilians or even the 'regulators' off their very heads by force so that he could have the souls he required to power his conquest. If the population revolted, then he could have gone about killing them for the extra souls. Instead he merely loses his patience and orders the wholesale slaughter to commence right off the bat, forcing existing souls in John and Jane Doe's possession to be consumed to repeatedly revive them. Essentially, he is losing out on 2+ souls in order to acquire a singular soul, a disgraceful waste of valuable resources. [/spoiler]\n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\n1. Several hours could be cut from the MSQ if the writers refrained from having the Scions or your Tuliyollan entourage pontificate on the importance of community and cooperation in every other quest. To paraphrase the late Stan Lee, you want to deliver a message without beating your audience over the head with it. The notion has become thoroughly waxed upon by the time you reach the halfway point, but it continues well into the latter half of the story.\n\n[spoiler] 2. The competition for becoming the next Dawnservant was a sadly hollow affair. Wuk Lamat was made out to be the underdog while her genuine competition, Zarool Ja, Bakool Ja Ja, and Koana were made out to be superior in every way. I understand that we can appreciate a good underdog story, but in the end there was no real contest, metaphorically and literally. The previews said that the Scions going to compete with one another, but there was never any combat against them, no philosophical debates, no battle of wits, not even an eating contest. Koana showed character growth and it would have been just as satisfying, if not more so, to actually see HIM win despite our best efforts and his shortcomings, but still realizing the value of having his sister serve alongside him. Instead, Zarool Ja is disqualified in what I believed to be an [b]uncharacteristic and sudden lack of restraint[/b] while Bakool Ja Ja, unsurprisingly, failed because he was just bad at everything he tried to do. Yet when it came to Koana he just gives up because he 'feels' like Wuk Lamat would be better, not because she truly bested him. He had a very solid chance of being able to succeed, learning from his mistakes and consulting others to strengthen his claim. Instead he chose not to and it 'feels' to me like it was for the expedience of the story. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] 3. I am not entirely certain about the political dynamics of Alexandria, but it seems highly arbitrary that they would be so willing to accept a 'King' from outside their own world to act as their commander in chief. For what reason was there no King from the onset? Were there no psychological screenings to determine the worthiness to rule? Was brute strength and the lucky possession of a literary McGuffin the only requirements? Perhaps this will all be explained in due time, but as it stands I am hard pressed to believe that a society so technologically advanced as to grant near-immortality as a matter of course couldn't have had countermeasures in place to prevent the potential abuse of powers. Yet this is exactly what happened.[/spoiler]\n\n\nAny other criticisms on my part from this point on would broach more into the subjective, rather than the objective. While I know writing a good story can be particularly difficult, especially when you have to somehow compete with the overwhelming success from Shadowbringers.

Dungeons are interesting and don't put you to sleep like they did in Endwalker, same for the trials, which makes me excited for the savage raids and ultimates to come. So if you enjoy FFXIV for the combat content you will likely have a good time.\n\nWhat's not so much fun is the main story. I don't even know where to begin without spoiling much, but the writing and pacing feels like a mess. There are sections where you spend at least an hour doing nothing but fetch quests, there's hardly any fighting to be done compared to the amount of chore quests and cutscenes. It takes around 3-4 hours before you reach the first dungeon. The story gets more interesting during the second half, but the first half feels like a slog with very little if anything at all to keep you interested. Krile and Erenville don't get nearly as much screentime or presence as Wuk Lamat despite their backstories being way more interesting plot points, it feels like missed potential. Wuk Lamat is also an annoying character you end up being stuck with for most of the story, to the point she's considered by many Lyse 2.0 . It also doesn't help that her English VA didn't do that good a job at voicing her, which could be a VA problem or whoever was supposed to be directing the voice acting didn't care. Wuk Lamat's english VA just seems incapable of putting in any emotion in their lines and it hurts to listen to when the context really demands that emotion, especially when [spoiler] Wuk Lamat shows up during the final trial, it's supposed to be a high energy, somewhat desperate moment with Lamat screaming to Sphene in hopes of reaching out to her even through Sphene trying to crush her [/spoiler] and it feels like lines are just being read from the script with no context given to the VA. It feels absurd to me that anyone in the office listened to these lines and thought this was good enough and didn't ask for another take. For comparison, you can check the VAs from the JP/FR/GER versions.\n\nSo all in all, as someone who wants to enjoy both the combat and the story, it's a very polarizing experience that doesn't leave me excited for more in the story department if not for the possibility that it can't get much worse.

TLDR at the bottom.\n\n[h3] Quick Overview [/h3]\n\nFirst off, I'll start by saying the new dungeon mechanics and trials are definitely good, they've taken difficulty a bit more seriously with this expansion and this was needed. I don't always agree with vertical scaling of difficulty but this did take a more lateral approach and added some creativity which was heavily lacking towards the latter half of Endwalker.\n\nSome of the zones are nice, I personally enjoyed Shaaloani the most. The music is hit or miss for me personally, the songs aren't bad, but some will become extremely obnoxious with time or do not fit their setting, especially the Crash Bandicoot theme of Tuliyollal, hub zones having drums that assault your ears are not hub zones I ever want to sit around in.\n\nThe graphics updates and the 2-channel dye system are a welcome addition, even if the dye is still heavily limited, it's still something. The graphics have gone a long way, the only negative I can say is that it's not ideal for those with lower specs, but there's so many layers to that onion that you can't necessarily fault SE for the change.\n\nNow to get into the real crux of the issue - the MSQ.\n\nI think it goes without saying that nobody was going into this expecting the next ShB or EW, it's unfair to say that anyone who didn't like the story didn't like it because it wasn't as spectacular as those patches. It's a ridiculous take, and disregards the concerns that most people have already brought forward.\n\nThe writing in this expansion was weak, it was all tell and very little show. It was very clear that they chose this medium to afford themselves the task of actually showing, through retcons such as using a voidgate asset as a portal to another shard (presumably the 9th), and having Y'shtola just randomly say \"btw not all voidgates go to the void\" the moment it's shown. \n\nYou spend hours in the early parts of the MSQ trying to learn about the world through being told about it and zero substance to back this up.\n\n[h3] The Chapters [/h3]\n\nYou go to Kozama'uka (bird village) with Wuk Lamat to be told that a storm had recently killed several people and ruined their homes. There's a few torn structures, but the real issue was the fact that no one acted like anybody died, even though they repeatedly tell you that this small village of people had casualties, surely someone would mourn or grieve, but instead you get silly little scenes where the main character of the expansion and the village people just dance around and smile and just have nothing to show for this devastation that was wrought upon them.\n\nThis chapter wraps up with a plot that retcons the way aether works, showing some dying crops that aren't fully grown, turn into fully grown healthy plants ready to harvest after 1 drop of aether and in another case, a transfusion of wind aether. Aether does not speed up time. Never in the story has aether ever been established as a force that can speed up the growth of things, by that notion you could force feed a child aether and they'd become an adult. It makes no sense.\n\nUrqopacha's chapter doesn't do anything egregious at first, but they tried to turn the MSQ into some kid's story book about the straw millionaire. It was long, and completely unnecessary. That entire chapter could've been written out and nothing in the story would change. The part that was really stupid was the kidnapping section, how are a group of scions standing 50 feet from Wuk Lamat, unable to see that she was taken captive by the equivalent of a trash mob. It was such a forced sequence that made no sense and the resolution was once again a tale from a kid's book.\n\nI don't have any real criticisms for Yak T'el, I think the development of Bakool Ja is welcome, and personally I enjoyed Shaaloani for the most part. \n\nI'm not gonna touch on the design for Heritage Found, Solution 9 and Living Memory, I was never going to be a fan of those to begin with but I'll keep my take out of this review as it's mostly personal preference, but I will just say the sense of urgency is so lost when exploring these zones. You're in the middle of a war and going shopping with the queen of the enemy nation is somehow a priority.\n\n[h3] Characters [/h3]\n\nLet's just get this out of the way right now, Wuk Lamat is a poorly designed character. This has nothing to do with the VA performance, I personally think they did a good job with the hand they were dealt, but Wuk Lamat as a character is insufferable. \n\nI don't think many people would've had a problem side-charactering for her if she just wasn't designed to be such a farce. Every 2 seconds she takes on a new anime protagonist trope, it's tiring, and fully lacks consistency. Remember how she's always been afraid of boats? Scroll up a sec and look at what she's doing 30 seconds into the gameplay trailer. Yep. Anyways.\n\nShe lacks any structured development, constantly wavering from serious to stupid, written like a child's picture book character, she's impossible to take seriously, even when we're trying to discuss how to help a land that gets ravaged by a storm and her people are suffering, she just acts like comic-relief without the comic or relief, it's so unbelievably forced and unwelcome.\n\nThe best I can say about characters in this expansion are regarding Bakool Ja and Koana. Both took on very big developments in their characteristics, none of which just happened overnight, they were well designed characters, seeing Bakool Ja slowly get humbled and still be himself but for the better, and Koana being a mystery that slowly emerged from his shell, these were great.\n\nAs for Zoraal Ja, that was unfortunately just a very typical villain story with no point. This antagonist tells us about his reasons for betraying his father, was because he wasn't given the throne, even though he had the chance to be given the throne and failed it. He resorts to betraying everyone at the end of the competition, murdering his companion and going into \"the golden city\", later returning to announce that he's powered up and has apparently still been harbouring this grudge for 30 full years, proceeds to kill his father in another dishonourable act.\n\nAfter all the transgressions and chaos, the innocents slaughtered, the city laid to waste, he could very easily have achieved his goal upon his initial siege, but he decides no. He must battle Wuk Lamat in an honourable duel later and cancel the siege... Very consistent. It also ends with us going 8v1 against him because of course it does.\n\n[h3] Worldbuilding [/h3]\n\nI see so many takes about how this is building a new foundation on the world, but nothing about how this is disregarding and throwing aside factors of the world that already exist. \n\nI've already explained my issue with the aether retcon above.\n\nMoving onto more serious factors, why is there no mention of the Final Days? The whole world was attacked by Meteion's assault, yes only areas weak in aether experienced the full force of the assault, but as the EW role quests had shown, there were still cases all over Eorzea of several people becoming Blasphemies, but this just didn't happen across the entire continent of the New World?\n\nWhat's going on with the (supposed) 9th shard? How does a shard with such an outstanding force, and such a huge advancement in weaponry not be noticed by the Ascians upon their initial plan to rejoin the source? The Ascians had always utilised the most powerful forces of nations to aid in their goals, but no one thought to go use space-tech that can travel between shards without the assistance of an Ascian to lay waste to anyone opposing them?\n\n[h3] TLDR [/h3]\n\nI have no more room to type so I'm ending it here.\nIf you like deep-lore, you'll be disappointed.\nIf you like Disney kids movies, maybe this is for you.\nDungeons/Trials are fun though.", "timestamp_created": 1720083261, "timestamp_updated": 1720083261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506719589233398438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168955508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363575002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The MSQ for this expansion is really not great.

For me, I don't like that I can't push those combo buttons freely. it takes too much of the work out of it.

But the story writing was subpar at most. A realm reborn & Shadow Bringers had much better writing to them, More structure with a much more pleasing build up. \n\nWuk Lumat came out as a hard ass, amazing adventurer. Warrior type with short temper and eager to get things done. And suddenly the new change of motive? Made no sense to me. Totally threw my original Views of the character when you first met them right out the window, From seeming so weak and vulnerable, And almost at their britches, in the lack of their problem solving skills during all these events. ( Like who hurt you during patch day for the two days we where gone ? )\n\nAll in all, Near the end of the expansion, I felt like they dragged it out way too long they slopped some bits and pieces together, And just said eh, \u201c Screw it, Lets just go with it and make it as long as freaking possible\u201d ( Filler Content ) \n\nThe whole expansion was very dialogue and cut scene heavy Most of it with repetitive nonsense that you heard ten minutes ago or read.  If you want a summary of all of this Just go spend 59.99 On Cyberpunk 2077 \u2026. You will get a much better story. \n\nCause that\u2019s what this whole Expansion turns into \u2013 FFXIV + Cyberpunk Ending + Uploading Consciousness to the cloud. And keeping the dead alive. I saved you nonsensical reading so feel free to skip the cut scenes  and not listen to poor dialogue.  It was just not for me, For those that do enjoy it good on you. Now lets get to the other nitty gritty of things \n\nClass\u2019s : Dear freaking god, They Homogenized classes even more. And made classes like BLM Clunky and useless, In favor of their new shiny class Pictomancer. Not much has really changed for other classes, A few little tweaks here and there. But Nothing has been gained out of it all. If not some classes feel more clunky than what they did in the previous class, Some classes having their abilities or things taken away like damage dealing gap closers that draw no more aggro, Gap closing can no longer be apart of your rotation unless you\u2019re a paladin and or warrior. \n\nPicto is a copy paste Summoner, with cast times. \n\nViper, Seems like it was all Hyped but no one really talks about it right now at this given moment, \n\nAll in all, I can\u2019t really Recommend this expansion to everyone, It might not be for everyone but it is also necessary to get because without it your not seeing lvl 100 anyways.  \n\nSo take it as you will. This is just absolutely subpar and unlike SE to put out something like this. I hope they make up on this with future patches and maybe expand on this cause it has felt really lack luster at most . \n", "timestamp_created": 1720076520, "timestamp_updated": 1720076520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524549782276153564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168948835", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978969288", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "What Dawntrail was advertised for was a :\n>Low stakes adventure \nThe idea of going from conquering stars, to go literally pick up bird shite or rocks doesn't sit well with me and this is important because we aren't talking about side-quests here, but the actual main-quest, the main dish of this expansion, its not an \"adventure\" and certainly isn't epic like it was advertise, it's standard korean mmorpg content that is done and redone.\n>interesting world and characters\nWoL takes a step back and becomes a yes man for Wuk Lamat for no good reason , its honestly humiliating considering i gotta suffer Wuk Lamat for the entirety of this expansion, collect bird shit and rock for her, essentially do what she was supposed to do, deliver her objective and got nothing in return, realistically is dumb but this is just a pattern for how things have stagnated with the game\n>the characters themselves\nWuk Lamat is an insufferable Mary Sue that ends up living up to her Disney \"I just want peace\" persona when the key of the castle are given to her, no sweat, this is reflected in one of the trials, in which we do all the work and she just has to watch and sample the fruit of our labor in the end, netting her ALL the credits even by the WoL themselves and do not let me started on the villains, literal saturday morning cartoon villains, nothing more or nothing less, there isn't much to say, these characters have no depth, they show up in cutscenes from time to time, do something silly and somewhat threatening only to end up looking stupid and moronic in the end, SquareEnix didn't learn a thing from ShB and why people love Emet-Selch so much. \n>that Trailer\nYou see that trailer, in which you see your companions going for treasure hunts, sampling food, visit bustling cities with huge festivals and huge crowds of people, the end result is just sad and pathetic, to surmise, the world building is just a pointless and sleep inducing drivel with no interesting characters to interact with and no side activities to do eve, it's just the same 10 year old MMO you know from before, what drives me nuts is that the world itself is just a useless set piece, to the point that even the monsters that roam the world are useless, whats the point of literally cluttering it if they serve no purpose whatsoever ? they dont give exp when killed, they don't have any loot and even for quests they don't matter because the quest itself will spawn a monster or two for you to kill, so again, what's the point of having huge regions with monsters in it ? \nTo Summarize : \nIt's a bad expansion, sold for 40 bucks on top of a subscription  fee with the most boring story line ever written for a FF game and even worse characters, what drives me nuts is that ... while my experience might be different for someone elses, a \"low stakes\" adventure doesn't excuse a dogshit storyline and badly written characters, you can have a relaxing bit of adventuring with a good story too.", "timestamp_created": 1720074686, "timestamp_updated": 1720074686, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51589202880859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168948702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046594847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Dawntrail is really a disappointment, we obviously expected a less rich story given that we had previously resolved approximately all the conflicts open since the start of the game, some things having been open for 10 years?

It has really high highs but also very low lows, in part because of abysmal pacing, terrible voice direction from the entirety of the new cast that makes ARR looks decent, inconsistency with what cutscnes are voiced and certain scenes where the devs don't take the situation as seriously as they should. For the first half things were pretty dull as it is if they just took 5 beast tribes and made it into the first half of the main story. By the time the story gets really damn good, Im at the level 98 quests and the game is almost over. It makes me wish they we couldve gotten an expansion about the stuff regarding solution 9 only and not Tural.\n\nThe new character Wuk Lamat is center stage instead of your oc being the main character. On paper its not a terrible idea, but in execution it leaves alot to be desired as the english voice direction for her is terrible (it got so bad I had to switch the voices to JP just to make her tolerable), repeating of the same tired jokes (gets sea sick and is a big scaredy cat) and constant talk about happiness and rainbows makes her character insufferable at times, however, when the story takes itself seriously, she has some genuinely great moments and you see her slow evolution from a spoiled brat who knew nothing about Tural into someone who knows more about her people and wants to keep the peace between them all. But those moments are few and far between. \n\nThe scions are such an afterthough that imo you could remove most of them from the story and nothing would change, theyre all pretty much there just to cash in a check. Gulool Ja Ja is an interesting character but like Ernville, Krile and Kanao, he doesnt get enough screentime to make him that interesting. I wish we had more screentime with them especially since at the end I found the new reveals about Krile and Ernville fascinating, and I wish they had gone into more time with them.\n\nWhen it comes to the combat and fight design however, I have nothing but positives about it. Fight design for the dungeons and trials is absolutely fantastic, bosses are frantic, chaotic and challenging with interesting new mechanics. Fights got so intense that I was running low on MP on a scholar from how hard I had to work to keep the party alive. Imo these fights are a huge step up from endwalker and give me hope that the raid tier will be just as intense and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1720061159, "timestamp_updated": 1720061634, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168937439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102403707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "While the new battle content provides challenge in a fresh, fun, more difficult and engaging way. The story aspect on the other hand is severely lacking in quality and nuance. The character of Wuk Lamat is forcibly shoved down player's throats causing her to become a tiresome and annoying presence throughout the entire story. If it was up to me, I'd rather go through the entirety of ARR story again because in there, our character is an active participant, not a mere bystander. I already set low expectations before for the main scenario since this was the start of a new saga but even then it still managed to hit an all time low I've never experienced before. Easily the weakest story expansion out of all releases. I'd rate the story a weak 4/10. It simply doesn't meet the quality and standard of a vibrant FFXIV story.\n\nOn the other hand, the battle content is a big step up compared to last expansion, Endwalker. Dungeon bosses and the trials ooze creativity once more and provides a challenge that is balanced for casual as well for midcore players. Fingers crossed and high hopes for the upcoming field operations and (alliance) raid series! I'd give it a solid 8.5/10 so far!\n\nAnd in all honestly, if it wasn't for the battle content, Dawntrail would've been an ultimate failure of an expansion.

But right now, as I proceed through the new MSQ, it is far from what I expected. The story is 95% cutscenes, with barely any interaction from the player between quests beyond the usual \"go here, talk to this person, now go here and talk to someone else\". \n\nI will give it credit where credit is due: the team did follow up on requests to have less solo content. Where I'm at so far, there's only been two solo instances. The scenery is by far the best yet, absolutely amazing for gposes and landscape screenshots. The new jobs are rather impressive, both being far more powerful than some previous jobs, even going so far as being able to easily draw aggro off a tank even with their tank stance turned on.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\nThe fights: while impressive, the fights are far harder than any previous content to date. What should take a party 15 minutes to complete can, and often will, instead take 30-60 minutes to beat, often resulting in members of the party struggling to keep up. Not only that, but they took away our good friend Invincibility upon Resurrection. A player can be resurrected, only to immediately die right as they touch the ground, there are no immunity frames to grant the player a moment to heal and prevent immediate execution by random boss attack. If you get rezzed, you're practically better off staying dead. Oftentimes it's rough on healers, as they run through MP so much faster due to the loss of those immunity frames. Long story short: everything is, difficulty-wise, as though Endwalker and Shadowbringers were mashed together to make one big, horrendously difficult love-child, one can only hope this is the result of a hidden \"challenge mode\" and that these things will become easier soon, otherwise I imagine many will be driven off.\n\nNew Players: As to be expected of a new release, a great many new players have arrived in Eorzea, many of which will grow angry if you are struggling with old content due to either having not done the content in awhile, or they deem that you're not paying attention, even if you are, they do not care, and will threaten to vote kick you, even at risk of other members of your party leaving should they actually do so.\n\nStory: The story is horrendously slow going for at least the first half (I'm just reaching the middle as I write this), many quests being either follow/lead X npc to Y destination, or simply talking quests. It would almost seem as though our time as the WoL is done for the moment, and that we are mentoring a half-baked character who seems to be a conglomeration of poorly written protagonists, more for her benefit than our own. We are not the hero here, but rather an observer and advisor, and there is little we contribute to the story beyond simple recommendations. Some dialogue choices that are presented to you do not even matter, as selecting them will simply result in NPCs telling you that you should wait a little longer before saying them. Alongside this, our fellow Scions feel far from themselves, often seeming just as bland and tasteless as the very apprentice the WoL seems to be mentoring. As mentioned before, story dungeons and trials are far harder than previous content, making even Endwalker's The Dead Ends look like a walk in the park by comparison.\n\nOverall, the expansion almost feels half-baked. The story is by far the most boring I've played so far. The dungeons are much too difficult for those wishing to simply play casually. The characters often seem more like stand-ins rather than the very characters we've grown to love in previous content. Locations are quite beautiful.

Spoilers Included !\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Wuk Lamat\n\nHave you ever wanted to experience becoming a secondary character in your own story? To feel what it must be like to be one of the NPCs following the great Dawnservant of Light. I know I haven't. But at least the music and combat is on point! \n\nWhen Wuk Lamat was first introduced I loved the character, she was a breath of fresh air and her jovial attitude made her likeable. I read someone compared her to the anime character Naruto which I can honestly see.\n\n[spoiler]\nFollowing the different promises during their rite of succession, we got to learn about the history and culture of the varied peoples of Tural. It was both fun and interesting to learn more about the continent and see how the characters both grew along the way.\n\nShaaloani ends up being a really nice zone, I found myself vibing with the wild west asthetic and by coincidence it's the zone Wuk Lamat doesn't assist you in whatsoever.\n\nThe succession happens and the tilted Zarool Ja comes to kill his father, after 30 years had past for him... This made little sense after obtaining a much greater power, but we'll chop that insanity and merely being used as a plot device to advance the story and introduce the Alexandrians. The mystery surrounding heritage found and it's people was was interesting, Solution Nine looked great and allows the game to introduce more modern glamour or future tech while being lore accurate.\n\nEven having not played much of FF9, Alexandria was hands down my favourite zone to inhabit. The people, music, design \n it was great and I really wish I could have seen more! It's a real shame to me that the most interesting zone is now completely dead and devoid of character and the only way to revisit it is via NG+. I completely understand from a story perspective why that choice was made.\n\nWuk Lamat being part of the party to defeat Zarool Ja made absolute sense, to get revenge for her farther and people slain and that's really where her participation should have ended, did she really have to come with us to Alexandria? She could have stayed in Tuliyollal and left it to the scions to deal with. During the Queen of Resolve trial, her coming in at the last moment to Mary Sue the party to victory was down right infuriating to say the least.\n\nA nice touch would have been the adventurer being immortalised in the stone plaques in Tuliyollal but instead it was the Dawnservents. The final cut scene does give me some hope that we can go more down the Azem route and explore other reflections as long as we can leave Wuk Lamat behind to run her city like we did Lyse.\n[/spoiler]\n\nIf I had to summarise my biggest issue with the story and in particular Wuk Lamat, it would be... Fatigue. By the end of the MSQ it had turned a character I loved into one I hated seeing on the screen. A character which had twice as many spoken words as the next character.\n\nLastly if you're going to make cities bigger, can we please at least mount up in them?

The content added in such as Dungeons and Trials is very entertaining and innovating and the gameplay aspect is wonderful, however, the dip in quality of the writing has never been greater. Not only has the voice direction for the new american voice actors for the EN voices been absolutely awful with the main character of the expansion not conveying any emotion for most of the expansion (the VA is very good however the voice director really wasted their talent by not conveying scenes correctly) but also most new characters never screaming and only 'talking in caps'.\nIn regards of the story itself, beware of spoilers:\n[spoiler] \nThe first arc of the story the sucession arc is the highlight of the expansion, it starts off as a slog like every other expansion in FFXIV but really gets interesting with each culture feeling brand new and makes you a bit attached to them. However there's a lot of moments in the story where they constantly hammer you with Wuk Lamat's confidence issues without being subvertive at all, it's like the scions are only there to state the obvious and to comfort Wuk Lamat whenever she needs confirmations. Also, the humor is very corny, fit for a manderville questline, not the main scenario quests. The new main writers have really outdone themselves in making the worst decisions for pacing, it's as if Ishikawa, the previous main writer for the past two expansions, gave them a general plot and made them connect the gaps between the main plot points and they failed to do so in any comprehensible way. Another problem with the quests is the huge amount of errand-boy, this being after HUNDREDS of hours of playtime you'd have to still talk to a NPC 3x, complete quest, walk a few meters and talk again complete quest, the huge lack of gameplay in the main scenario quests is palpable and they had multiple opportunities to add something unique, definitely disappointing.\n\nFor the second part, and what is the worst part of the expansion is the second arc: The very last zone Living Memory is just a rehash of the previous 2 expansions last zones, except inverted? Worse? The new writers were so lazy they couldn't come up with anything new and had to repeat what worked before but not get the reason why Amaurot and Ultima Thule worked out so good. Now after you finish the main scenario questline you're left not only with a disappointing story conclusion where everyone dies and you pulled the trigget to kill them but also one of the most beautiful maps of the entire game left into a monochrome .jpeg slapped on top as a repeated pattern texture, even the music has been almost muted!\n\nLastly, the one part that affected this expansion at every single waking moment: There's too much Wuk Lamat! Every quest she has to tag along with you, it's as if she's the new stand-in for the protagonist! She not only overshadows every other character but the player itself! The writers seriously overestimated how much she would be liked and don't get me wrong, Wuk Lamat is a nice character but not in the quantities presented!\nI've played this game since 2021 and have LOVED every expansion until now, but after finishing the new expansion's story today, I have been left disappointed.\n[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this expansion ranks the worst for me in terms of story, but only thanks to the very high quality graphical update and the awesome dungeons and trials it is passable.\nHowever this trend CANNOT continue and I seriously hope Square Enix listens to player feedback and doesn't repeat such mistakes in the upcoming post-patches for this expansion and future expansions.", "timestamp_created": 1720054120, "timestamp_updated": 1720054120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505831420421600342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168930470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971365021", "num_games_owned": 1035, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "My daughter and I have been playing FFXIV for a few years now.

Poor pacing in the first half of the MSQ filled with what must be close to 30 talk to 3 people, stand here for 10 seconds, watch this cut scene quests. Shadowbringers and Endwalker at least had stories that were up to the task of hiding the tediousness of these quests. \n\nI'd be shocked that people were surprised by the divisiveness of this expansion or its mixed reception, but the community has made it clear how they feel about criticism  for years.  Even now when you go through comments and the like on social media its plagued with, \"you're playing it wrong\" or \"you skipped all the cut scenes of course you don't like it\" and my favorite \"It's always been like this what are you expecting?\" \n\nThe writing was on the walls for weeks as well. I've heard Yoshi-P say the term \"8.0\" more times in most of his interviews than I heard him talk about this expansions new features. The vast majority of which weren't even shipped in the game and won't be added until future updates. \n\nThis repeated formula for the last 3-4 expansions has gotten tiresome and lazy. They even reuse music constantly in this expansion and new music (arguably the best part of it so far) is few and far in between. The expansion has to many cut-scenes that summarize the previous cut-scene writing is the opposite of concise and poorly paced. Without spoilers charter development for some of the mainstays in this expansion doesn't happen until the absolute last minute that it can, and feels rushed despite all the filler they had before they could have filled it with. \n\nGetting to 100 in a game like this should feel good but the lack of new skills and lame changes makes it feel like a an afterthought of an afterthought, and if you thought you'd have something new to try after the MSQ you're wrong. It's the same 3 dungeons as always four \"raids\" in a week and none of the other advertised features will even be here for another four months at minimum. \n\nIf this games development team wasn't so beloved by parasocial redditors I think the blow back would be a lot more extreme.

Hands down - the worst gaming experience in general. And it upsets me a lot because I love this game, yet dawntrail is a complete disaster. I wish i could enjoy it, and recommend it to people but unfortunately its a miss. \nI wont speak on the culture aspect since I'm not an american nor do I have any interest in N|S america in general, but it seems Like the only thing they nailed right. Yet beside that, it's so hard to find a single thing which is actually good about this dlc. I had low expectations, but they got broken too. To put pros and cons in simple terms:\n\n+\n1. Good location designs. the best in this game so far. The amount of care and details put into them is really noticeable\n2. Good dungeons, they've definitely improved from previous expansions\n3. Erenville\n4. Two dye system\n\n-\n1. Story. Having a bad story in a story based game is a crime. If you don't like the msq you are left with nothing quite frankly. I would give it a pass if it was a game for 12-14 yo kids, but its not. Writing team is so afraid to let anything meaningful happen. All your losses are superficial and in a game, which focuses on you own customization character, you as a player is here as a decoration. You are not a part of the story like at all. Every single moment is predictable in a not good way and every single problem is solved by power of friendship. My little pony done it better\n2.Eng dub. And no its not about Wuk Lamat's va. The entirety of English voice cast is the worst I ever heard. Don't know what went wrong this time, but switching dub language makes your experience less miserable\n3. Graphic update. It's now a wax figure museum. They promised to keep the identity of the game and failed on their words. If you are attached to your character a lot, yo will probably be disappointed.\n4. Gear. Most of the gear are reused assets. And they couldn't even keep one design philosophy for same sets. The difference between vanguard tank set and every other vanguard set is painful. You 're paying almost 40 for a dlc and won't even get a good looking gear. A lot of job gear also looks like half reused designs\n5. Wuk Lamat. I don't hate her. But I hope she will not take 90% of screen time in future patches. She is absolutely unbearable and is another victim of terrible writing. If you don't like her you will not like the story\n6. Job identity. Just forget it. It's gone and their team doesn't seem to care\n7. Music. The most forgettable soundtracks. And 10 years old music sequences are getting really old. Are no one tired of hearing same melodies in exactly same plot points? I've played this expac since early access and I can't remember a single one.\n\nAs a conclusion.

The first half is fine if you like the character but it does feel like filler so it may feel a bit slow. However, the second half is full of constant plotholes, poorly managed tension (the cast starts singing and camping out for a few days while people in need are in immediate danger), and inconsistent or otherwise insufficiently explained spirituality and lore that at best, completely disrupts the themes that they were aiming for, and at worst, leads your character to commit what I would consider to arguably be the mass killing of innocent people for no real reason. Even the reason for doing so, that the main character was given, is never brought up again and is never fulfilled, resulting in 6 hours of totally pointless quests with no impact on the story, even if you are invested. \n\nAre people considered living if they have a soul and memories? Great question, but the game simultaneously decides yes for some people, and no for others, without any discussion or reason why.

The story are somewhat complicated  like we know about Electrope and everything but Sphene being endless like everyone else and being the real final boss break my heart plus I dont like the fact about the soul collecting to become one with soul to gain power and erasing soul with memory in final zone which make me very angry than seeing 120 dead children in Skydeep dungeon so what Im trying to say here is it just not right with the story. \n\n3. The scions should have bigger role than short like Thancred, Urianger and Estinien if they can be more helpful like before and they could have included Raha and Y'shtola becuz they are part of the story too since the trailer of them appearance so that way we all can enjoy and laugh but in the end it was always short becuz like I said about the 1 part is always about Wuk Lamat, they should have let us play as Scion and heck even Koana becuz it would be so much better than Wuk Lamat. 4. Zoraal Ja intention was unknown to us becuz according to Zoraal Ja, he stated he want to peace and protect his peoples of Tural by become Dawnservent so instead of the writer who make him look evil, he should have been a hero like he helped us in Valigarmanda boss. honestly opinion I was hoping Sareel Ja to be the true villain but still no change thx to the writer. that is my real opinion about DT msq so it 4/10 to me", "timestamp_created": 1720043167, "timestamp_updated": 1722843848, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713229179382324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168919441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081514088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I miss Lyse...", "timestamp_created": 1720042356, "timestamp_updated": 1720042356, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53592604398727417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168918879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147224420", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1318142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11090, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "skipped the story, still felt like slop", "timestamp_created": 1720041923, "timestamp_updated": 1720041923, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434063702821731567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168918749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040211186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This is...

Yet Dawntrail's MSQ is just bad. Just because it's the start of a new arc doesn't mean it has to be so boring. If the biggest strength and central game of the game is bad, what else is there?\n\nYou're not main character in the story, but instead some annoying cat is. There was poll for most favorite character in the story, yet this cat didn't make it even into top 10. Keep in mind there's perhaps like 20 notable chracters in total. That's how bad it is.\n\nEverything evolves around this annoying cat. She says she has lot to learn, yet her actions are always perfect and she always knows what to do. No clue what player character's role is even supposed to be, we just stand in the backgroud most of the time. She's not necessarily bad character, it's just that anyone with so much exposition gets annoying very quickly. She became Poochie of FFXIV. EN voice is just terrible, I didn't know it's possible to shout in lowercase. Don't even bother and switch to JP.\n\nActual story is spread very thin, since there's insane amount of padding. No, it's not worldbuilding when you go to traders' village, and find out that... they do trade. It's nothing but waste of time. This keeps repeating, you keep going from village to village, find 1 or 2 uninteresting quirks about them, you solve their issue and you go to the next village. If that sounds boring, then that's because it is. First 2-4 hours have genuinely 0 gameplay, it's all cutscene after cutscene.\n\nBudget is so low. So many cutscenes are unvoiced, you can easily get 5-6 unvoiced cutscenes in the row. Luckily you know that nothing important will happen to them, so you can just skip it. \n\nStory gets better at 97, then most of 99 MSQ is back to padding, and then 100 trial gets ruined by the damn cat again. I hope we never see the Poochie Lamat again. \n\nJob design is atrocious. They doubled down on the already bad job design in EW and even straight up said they won't start fixing it until the next expansion, so please look forward to it in 2027. But fights seem so much better so far,\n\nThe graphical update is still not finished. It was initially meant to be released gradually in EW patches, yet whole expansion later, it's still far from finished, not even gear of the main NPCs is done. Same goes for the second dye channel, it seems like barely a quarter of all gear supports it, and even if it does, the second channel can be for some random details like tassels or strings on a button. After lackluster patches in EW, is this really all they've been working on?\n\nI knew that Shadowbringers was the peak and it would be hard to come close to it, but I didn't expect such a drastic fall from grace.

During early acess I grinded levels for pictomaner along with 2 vipers and a healer that was nice enough to help us get fast ques in roulette. Even though we 3 dps were still learing our new jobs that came out that day we had little to no issue finishing all the roulettes including a lvl 80 dungeon.\nNOTE we finished multiple dungeons including a high level one with no tank, this is a problem. At this point any content older than the current expac is just practicing your rotation with little to no chance of dying assuming you're paying the minimum amount of attention. But even the new 91-100 dungeons that people complained about being too hard are now just like any other dungeon now that people know what to expect and also having higher level gear. Throughout the previous expansions I got every job to 90 and now I don't have much motivation to get more than a couple jobs to 100\n\nI had plans to get back into raiding and finding new friend groups this expac back with the combination of the shitty story and content becoming so easy it feels like busy work or a chore I'm gonna unsubscribe and use my money for the subscription to save for better games\n\nEven when the next major patch comes out I'm going to wait and see if the story improves and if they make adjustments to gameplay, if not I'm gonna skip out on this expansion and accept I just wasted a good chunk of money for the expansion and the subscription", "timestamp_created": 1720036311, "timestamp_updated": 1724886053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168910028", "author": {"steamid": "76561199240089863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Wuk Lamat are so annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1720035080, "timestamp_updated": 1720035080, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588477373123168945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168909484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083145111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, since I've finished the MSQ I think its only fair that I give this a review and my thoughts on the matter. I've been an avid and dedicated player of XIV with over 400 days, 23 hours, 27 minutes logged on my account so I think I have just as much as a valid opinion on this expansion as anyone else does. \n\nOverall I think this expansion was...just mid at best. However I think all the negatives just outweigh the positives in this. So here is a little TLDR;\n\nPros:\n-More content to do in XIV\n-The dungeons and trials were good\n-Love Letter to Final Fantasy IX fans\n\nCons:\n-Horrible story pacing.\n-Story doesn't get interesting till the lvl 97 dungeon.\n-Wuk Lamat's EN voice is dreadful. An AI program could do a better job. (First time I felt I had to switch to JP VA).\n-Not a summer vacation as much as it is a babysitting mission.\n-A lot of what makes the later half of the story good will be lost on people who haven't played or know the story of FF IX.\n-Wasted character potentials.\n\n[h3]====THE MSQ====[/h3]\nThe progression through the MSQ was....incredibly slow and dull to put it bluntly. Like I get it, we are coming to a new location in the world of Eorzea so we have to be introduced to the people, their culture, and how things operate in Tural. However, the way it was done really struggled to keep me interested. I don't know what changed with the pacing and the writing because the way it was done back in say like Shadowbringers when we were learning about the First was way more interesting and engaging. This was just a bore to sit though. Hell I think the way it was done in Stormblood when we first came to Kugane and learned how things worked there was far more interesting. \n\nAnother point of contention I have with this expansion's story is that it was promoted as a 'Summer Vacation' for the Warrior of Light. This was anything but that; it was more or less an expansion long babysitting mission with the WoL watching over Wuk Lamat and only jumping in the mix when she needs help. Not the most exciting thing in the world honestly in my honest opinion. Another thing was that we were told that the Scions would be at odds against each other in all of this, and I was really expecting for us to have to fight the other Scions while competing for the title of Dawnservant. That never really happened, and I'll be honest here, I was expecting something a little more serious.\n\nWhich brings me to the next thing...the story doesn't get interesting till you get to the lvl 97 dungeon and doesn't really pick up until after the dungeon is finished. Which is really sad because that's like what.. 60-70% of the story? That's just really disappointing because this Expansion is supposed to be a love letter to Final Fantasy IX. I love FF IX as much as the next Final Fantasy fan, and I do think that the references and parallels to the story in IX were very good. However, if that's the only thing that Dawntrail has going for it then that's not a whole lot to go on now is it? Shadowbringers and Endwalker already set a bar really high that I kept my expectations fairly on the down low for this expansion I know that trying to compare this to those two is a bit unfair, but at the same time there's no excuse for the beginning half of the story to be this boring and the good parts just jam packed towards the later half.\n\n[h3]====THE CHARACTERS====[/h3]\nOh boy the characters....I want to say that there is like only 4 characters in the MSQ that are remotely even important? Wuk Lamat obviously, and then there's Krile, Zoraal Ja, and the Enigmatic Maiden ([spoiler]Queen Sphene[/spoiler]). Pretty much everyone else including the Warrior of Light (yes, you the player) felt like they're all just side characters in the grand scheme of this story. Because this story isn't about you as the WoL coming to the new world to just find the city of gold. This is Wuk Lamat's story. \n\n\nDawntrail's MSQ is mainly focused around Wuk Lamat. Which don't get me wrong its a nice and interesting twist on things and I'm no stranger to games or stories where the Main Character/Protagonist isn't the main focus. I just feel like it could have been done better. Now, a lot of people will have mixed feelings about Wuk Lamat; some enjoy her and others don't like her all that much. I do genuinely think that she is an okay and decent character. She may not be the best or well written character, but I do think that she is okay. For me though she is just not the kind of character I personally like or enjoy because of her unbearably naive way of thinking. That and while she may not have all the qualities of a Mary Sue, she kind of comes off as that way. That isn't my problem with her...my main issue with her, is the EN voice acting....I have absolutely no idea what Square was doing with the EN voice acting for this character, but Wuk Lamat's EN voice is absolutely god awful and atrocious. I couldn't hear it all that well from the Dawntrail trailer, but after hearing her speak in game I felt like my soul wanted to curl up and die. The voice just felt...completely out of place, stilled and was immersion breaking, it was so off. I immediately switched the voice acting to JP because there was no way I was going to sit through a whole expansion listening to...whatever the hell that is. I have never switched the Voice Acting from English for the longest time since I first started playing during Stormblood and thought the EN voice acting was okay. However this was a first I felt like I had to change the voice acting to JP. Which is unfortunate because again this whole expansion is focused on Wuk Lamat, so I have no idea why Square would do her dirty like that...Do better Square please I know you can deliver on high quality voice acting.\n\nWuk Lamat aside the only person that kept me interested in the MSQ was Krile and her part in all of this, I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil anything but she played a major key role in all of this. So much that I kinda wished that this expansion was more about her instead of Wuk Lamat. I just feel like her backstory should have been the main focal point instead. If anything I would say she was the one character I was more invested in and was cheering on the most in all of this. And I mean...come on its Krile we are talking about here, shes been through so much with the WoL (the player) that you can't help but hope things go well for her. \n\nZoraal Ja would be next on the list of important characters that played a key role in the MSQ. Listen, I'm just going to say it straight and forward. Zorral Ja along with Krile and the Enigmatic Maiden were the only ones keeping me invested in the MSQ. Krile I've already gave my reasoning. Zoraal Ja I was more curious about him because well...I wanted to think there was more to his actions, his reasons, and his words than what was being presented. To an extent there was, and in the end I wasn't disappointed with his role in the story. I will say however that I think there should have been a little bit more to touch up on his character a bit. Like tell us how he was like growing up, what his experiences were and such. \n\nLastly the Enigmatic Maiden...this part is going to be mostly spoilers but I'll try to keep it down low. I found her part in this far more interesting than anything else in the MSQ to be honest. Which like I said is sad because she doesn't become relevant till way later in the MSQ. Another thing is, is that while I like all the FF9 references being brought up from her introduction, at the same time all of this is going to be lost on someone who hasn't played FF9. With that in mind I fail to see how an average player who has no knowledge of FF9 in general can enjoy this part of the MSQ. Which, again makes it even more sad because the MSQ doesn't become interesting till she is introduced and you get all of the reference drops. That being said though I did enjoy her role in the MSQ overall and liked her character dynamic.", "timestamp_created": 1720034622, "timestamp_updated": 1720121282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420548766851425171", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168908125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106318599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing this game for 8 years and I don't think I've had a harder time getting through the main story as I have with Dawntrail.

Think you're getting the vacation expansion to have a low-stakes story and decompress after the back-to-back world-ending stakes of Endwalker from the trailer? Think again as Dawntrail has both world-endangering and world-ending stakes compressed into one plot. No breaks for us, nope! It's not like trying to get the player to take the main threat seriously after defeating the reality-ending force of existentialism itself is going to be very difficult when someone thinks about it for two seconds.\n\nGameplay during the majority of the main story brings up the question of \"what gameplay?\" since the majority of gameplay you get after walking around and performing \"talk to 3 villagers to understand an entire culture\" and the occasional \"follow/lead NPC to X location\" is just cutscenes. There's long gaps of time between the usual formulaic dungeon-trial-dungeon structure of the story where you rarely if ever actually use your combat skills leading to a good majority of the story simply an unbroken chain of fetch and talking quests. For the single-player instance encounters they pale in comparison to the instances that Shadowbringers and especially Endwalker had. The combat in those make some of the easiest instances I've played in recent FF14 history and lack of the spectacle or complexity means that neither your eyes or your brain are awed by it. The dungeons and trials at the very least this expansion's gameplay's saving grace, providing a higher challenge compared to previous dungeons for even me, a midcore player. As for job changes your mileage may vary. The changes to the jobs I consider my mains simply made them clunkier versions of their Endwalker iterations and only decreased my enjoyment playing them.\n\nAs for the story where do I even begin? It's no secret that one of the primary reasons for Dawntrail's mixed reception was the story and after playing through the entirety of it I now really understand where it's coming from. Firstly, the main requirement of enjoying this story hinges on the one, single question: \"Do you like Wuk Lamat?\". This is because she is stuck to you for an overwhelming majority of the story and breaks from her presence and spotlight are incredibly sparse and I don't say this as if she's taking only you, the Warrior of Light's spotlight, no, she takes [i] everyone's [/i] spotlight. Other characters that you meet and accompany are simply in the same boat as the WoL and are secondary to Wuk Lamat in every category, even Krile who had buildup to be important in this expansion but only receives a small portion of the story to paying-off that buildup. This results in characters which are introduced in this expansion being underdeveloped and unable to compel me in remotely caring and returning characters that I was attached to being nothing more than planks of wood that excuse themselves with contrivances to leave the party when they're no longer needed. While the WoL taking a secondary role happened in Stormblood to Lyse at least in that expansion we were given our own reasons to be invested in the story through the characters we met along the way and the WoL's dynamic with Zenos.\n\nWuk Lamat as a character herself has the writers put her in an incredibly difficult position to be likable from the outset with her hot-headed, enthusiastic warrior set-up in Endwalker's patch story being discarded to instead be a self-doubting sheltered kid that doesn't know the basics of her land and her people, somehow requiring us to babysit her as she learns something that should've been already known to her as a native. Her naivety results in her making mistakes including one which endangered her own life and somehow resulted in her not learning a single lesson as she carries the same naivety to the ending unchanged but without the self-doubt. And not content with simply being effectively mentally unchangeable she also grow substantially more powerful in combat prowess over the course of the story but us as the player don't really see why and how she does before being shown her being able to fight enemies she was previously unable to contend with. The story desperately wants you to like her and want her to ascend to being the next Dawnservant but gives no reason to trust her capability to actually rule other than her vague promises of peace and happiness for Tural which she repeats many, many times as if we don't get it already. This is in competition to three other contestants that are much more interesting in their goals but us as the player are given no option to support or find out more of as the plot confines us to supporting Wuk Lamat. And when she does become Dawnservant the different groups of people supporting other candidates stop mattering and suddenly love her despite not having a strong starting base of supporters and nothing she promises truly meeting what opposing cultures want. The differences between candidates is also diluted when her brother is fully converted to supporting her which leaves the competition to be framed into simply \"good vs. evil\" when previous political plot lines in FF14 were at least trying to be more nuanced.\n\nAt the end she's a generic shonen protagonist without the essential steps to being a decent shonen protagonist that also has the repeating joke of seasickness attached, because I guess they needed us to have that drilled into our head along with her goal of peace. And considering that she takes up most of the spotlight while other characters get benched, if I don't care about her what else is there to care about?\n\nAs for the antagonists they don't fare much better as the bunch of them either get converted to good by Wuk Lamat and then dropped from the story or don't have time to be developed before dying and receiving a last minute sob story to illicit a response from the player. One of them even gets a son that they severely neglect but somehow gets revealed that they cared about them all along in their last words despite it being emphasized earlier that they, the parent, was a horrible person. I sincerely don't know what they were trying to accomplish with that scene.\n\nThe plot itself for the first half is mostly uneventful, doing quests similar to beast tribe quests we would've done as side content in any other expansion. The second half of the plot felt rushed, hampered by the amount of time that was taken by the first half of the story and connected only by the off-screen actions of others and a thin thematic connection of memories and immortality while lifting story beats from Shadowbringers and Endwalker. Zones come and go as we don't spend nearly enough time to learn more about the local cultures and ends up making each culture that Wuk Lamat, and by extention the player, have to learn about be defined practically by one trait, a far cry from the amount of detail that non-city locations had in previous expansions. This isn't helped by amount of stating obvious subtext and redundant dialogue that really should've caught by editors that result in cutscenes of nothing that are longer than they should be and negatively affect the pacing (seriously, did you need to both tell and show me how something works three times in a row?). Overall the plot lacked both the highs and lows of previous expansions leaving it not just forgettable but due to similarities to Shadowbringers and Endwalker, derivative.\n\nThis expansion is substandard, a first in my experience with FF14. It doesn't respect the player's time, their intelligence, or characters that aren't Wuk Lamat. Maybe the patch story would be better, who knows? But this lack of quality shouldn't be the first step for a new era of FF14.", "timestamp_created": 1720033482, "timestamp_updated": 1720033482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503751039505004883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168907777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102266723", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is insultingly bad, I was watching Youtube during cut-scenes as I was so bored.", "timestamp_created": 1720033197, "timestamp_updated": 1720033197, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48067668080329895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168907748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004311443", "num_games_owned": 771, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "female hrothgar was a mistake.", "timestamp_created": 1720033179, "timestamp_updated": 1720033179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400864094495773315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168907310", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986094481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "90% der MSQ besteht aus Fillerquests und Wuk Lamat", "timestamp_created": 1720032842, "timestamp_updated": 1720277077, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510127246379852295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168906894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024387486", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely boring and dull storyline.

The questing however, is still as archaic and boring as it was in previous expansions. We're talking at least an hour between killing one trash mob that you'll put down in about 5 seconds. Best case scenario, you're a cutscene skipper and get to spend hours running back and forth from point A to point B to unlock a 20 minute dungeon that recycles the same gameplay pattern as all the other dungeons, but with some more interesting boss fights. Credit where credit is due, they are more fun than the previous dungeons which could be done with both eyes closed after the first run in most cases. Worst case scenario, you're watching The Wuk Lamat Show hoping for a glimpse at any form of combat.\n\nIf you're here for FFXIV's deeply praised writing and interesting cast of characters, turn back. There is none of that here. This is The Wuk Lamat Show, and if you don't enjoy this shonen protag furry woman talking to you like a child about the power of friendship and understanding and don't think watching her fall down or cry is the pinnacle of comedy, you will not enjoy the next 30+ hours of story. Think like a more preachy Jar Jar Binks. Wuk Lamat is a plague upon this expansion's writing. Everything revolves around her. Everything. Every conversation. Every cutscene. Every other character is a bland mouthpiece to shout words of encouragement toward her. I can't stress this enough. All the other characters, do nothing. If you were hoping for a character driven adventure through Tural, you will find nothing here for anyone other than Wuk Lamat. Even Krile and Erenville, who I was really looking forward to getting to know, have close to nothing to do other than be accessories to Wuk Lamat, giggling at her and scolding her as she has another bout of sea sickness or falls down another hole for the sake of \"comedy\". It is an absolute waste of potential.\n\nYou, as the Warrior of Light, aren't even there to mentor her. Instead, you listen to other characters spout off platitudes about the power of friendship and how believing in yourself is important and then smile and nod. Smile and nod. She then will voice those same tired life lessons back to you, and you will smile and nod. You are not her mentor. You're just her errand boy/girl. If your idea of good character development is going from liking peace and acting like an idiot to liking peace and being less of an idiot, you're in for a good time. Oh yeah, and you're also installing this moralizing Naruto wannabe as the leader of an entire country for no discernible reason other than the fact that she's nice and two of the other candidates are cartoonishly evil villains. It's like someone at the SE headquarters accidentally dropped their preteen daughter's fan fiction where the final draft of the MSQ was supposed to be, and now we're all stuck playing through it. This is Wuk Lamat's world, and we're all just living in it.\n\nThe plot is slow, as expected, but also written in the most uninteresting and infantilized way possible. Fresh start? New adventure? Nah. You play white savior to a tribe of bird people for a couple hours because they forgot how they harvest their crops every year, and their leader doesn't want to tell them. Don't worry savages, we're here to remind you of your own culture. We have ALWAYS, in EVERY expansion, been exposed to new cultures and peoples. Never before has an entire expansion had this much focus on that aspect of world-building and done it in such a simplistic and uninteresting way. There is one section that is decently written, and the rest are painfully amateurish. This is most of the MSQ until over halfway through where the writing gets more interesting but even less coherent.\n\nI won't spoil it, but the plot contrivances are massive and the pacing is god awful. There is no sense of urgency, and the tone is never consistent. And yes, Wuk Lamat is still hogging up 99% of the screentime with her god awful antics and childish platitudes in every scene. A villain with no intrigue or development is deus ex machina'd into the plot. The final zone has the potential to be interesting but is presented with absolutely no nuance. Never did I think I would be so bored and, at times, outright appalled by the questing and plot beats in the level 100 area of the game.\n\nDawntrail is an absolute embarrassment for Final Fantasy XIV. This isn't just bad writing by their standards, but by JRPG standards. ARR has excellent world building. Heavensward has a beautiful self-contained plot. Stormblood has a great cast of fun and interesting characters. Shadowbringers has amazing character development and one of the best villains in the series. Endwalker has crazy plot beats and story revelations that come together in an emotionally resonate if a bit messy finale. Dawntrail has a catwoman Naruto-clone dragging you around to do menial tasks and preaching about the power of understanding that ends in the most nonsensical way possible. Dawntrail not only sucks as an expansion, but actively hurts the world-building and writing of what will come after. I am hoping YoshiP and his crew manage to salvage something out of this dumpster fire, but for the first expansion in this new arc...\n\nDawntrail is a complete disappointment.", "timestamp_created": 1720025717, "timestamp_updated": 1720157067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 311, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628543198108673096", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168897856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014834298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "A very mediocre experience story could use a lot more work, with how some of characters are written it is very much a hit and miss.

Which is forgivable and not a big deal. I think we can overlook that part and understand the main message the game was putting out. \n\nGearing is another issue I have with FF14, nothing has improved in gearing and I feel like nothing will change in how we recieved our gearing or have optional ways of getting BiS. I may have to hit FFXIV forums about this topic.\n\nAs far as everything I found DawnTrail kinda stuck in mid, the culture of things is that many indigenous people of that time did not have \"colorful hair\" and I found this is strange as how the world see's us westerners,  I felt this \"identity politics\" are being overplayed here in the shadows of things and its getting out of hand that we as gamers are tired of this. \nAlso to mention that  I can say this that many indigenous cultures were very harsh and did bad things to their own people as a bad example (sacrificing rituals) and its gets pretty gruesome which I'm glad they did not added that bad stuff in DawnTrail.\n\nSo far I give the story for the most part an 8 out 10, 0 being negative and 10 being positive. for a good effort and  I do encourage try to get Voice actors from those areas that Tural represents someone who is from Columbia or has indigenous roots that may give more expression and life into those specific new main characters that DawnTrail has given us. \n\nAnd my dislikes are a lot that I can not provide here on this review that I need to  go yo FFXIV forums for. \n\nI can not recommend this game to anyone yet until they work somethings out ingame.

If I completely set aside the new story which to be honest I really have to do in order to continue playing this game then the music is good, dungeons i've played so far are interesting and the new scenery is beautiful. The new combat changes and graphical updates are good too. Then we have Dawntrail msq...it's a shell of what it could have been, it's far too centred on the one character who is not likeable but throughout you are forced to fully support which is very grating when they're obnoxious. The story has made me feel like i've gone from being this incredibly epic hero in Endwalker to an air headed cheer leader for Wuk Lamat who is even more empty headed than I am (all of a sudden- like why am I just all of a sudden floating around not really caring about what I am doing anymore?) but hey at least we want world peace or something....more importantly look a butterfly yey! Wuk lets get you on a boat again it's sooooo funny when it makes you sick. Another thing why would the Eorzean champion, god slaying WoL get involved in foreign political affairs? Whoevers team we choose (hah no we don't really have a choice but lets pretend) we are giving a crazy advantage it's pretty much a guaranteed win since i'm unstoppable ....I reeeeally should not be taking sides like this. The fact i'm unstoppable is well known to everybody except all these new people i'm meeting so i'm also now lying by omission. I feel like a bad guy. I've been downgraded from hero to some sellsword who will do whatever she feels like because she's all powerful! so basically i'm no better than the new 'bad guy' they've introduced who uses purely his strength to get what he wants. Also zero immersion for me personally when the english voices are completely mis-matching what characters look like...aside from the obvious wuk VA what the heck was the sailors voice at the beginning on the boat about?? he sounded rough as hell like some old 65 yr old smoker pirate but he looked 20 kinda funny but too weird if you want an immersive experience. I've never been a story skipper in any of the previous expansions i've played but this one i'm rolling my eyes and skipping scenes regularly just to be able to level my character. I don't know if the story will get better...but atm it's just not doing it for me. I think honestly they would've been better off going on with a story including Zero from the previous expansion somehow. Or for gods sake let me choose who I want to support in Dawntrail like Koana would make way more sense to me. They need to bring back the previous writer/s and fix the voice acting pronto. I'm going to keep going with it to the end of this part because well i've paid for it and it's too late for me but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless I was going to suggest skipping and getting it all out of the way and just focusing on the game itself...but even then..probs still wouldn't. Edited to say I tried to finish it (got to a part where you have to play as Wuk Lamat in a crappy fight what a bloody surprise) but it's just a waste of time it sucks I hate it so i've moved onto other games it's genuinely upsetting because the gameplay is still great but the story was important to me and something I really enjoyed before.

However, this highlight is not uniform across all characters, with some developments or character motivations, especially for two of the antagonists, being abrupt or straight up incomprehensible.", "timestamp_created": 1719992366, "timestamp_updated": 1719992366, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463308721780776978", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168856016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042905819", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 116036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 805, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "So people claiming people who dislike the story because its not about their character. Oblivion is one of my favourite games, where you play second man to the main character Martin Septim, so I don't have a huge issue with that. Its the quality of the writing where I take my umbrage in this expansion.\n\nYou are constantly told things and never shown them, you're told a character has grown or you're told how skilled someone is at something, they make sure to tell you but rarely ever show you anything. Which is in stark contrast to how characters like Emet-Selch were written who we were told little about, but showed us how capable he was.\n\nOutside of that, we're constantly having the same things reiterated to us over and over again, such as the supposed character growth we're being told about. They aren't respecting their audience enough to expect them to understand these things and need to not only tell them, but reiterate it over time and time again. It gets incredibly tiring.\n\nBeyond that, old tropes are used but with a very surface level understanding, its like the people heading this expansion saw what was done in Heavensward, the idea of resolving issues and having people cooperate but entirely tossed aside the nuance of that, since in Heavensward it came with consequence, not everyone was actually happy and willing to cooperate, here that kind of conflict simply doesn't exist.\n\nWe're expected to care about characters and a portion of the world we've barely been introduced to as if it was always somehow important, like we should be invested in this character they're trying to build up and care about these people we really don't know or have connections with and do a terrible job of actively trying to create that connection, its done with a bare bones effort and is almost a mockery of the writing quality that came before this. \n\nOutside of that, not only do really obvious plot points happen you can see coming from a million miles away, but the villains never succeed because they're smart. Instead the current writers somehow think by making our characters behave and do the most stupid things possible, which enables the villain. The villain is now somehow both capable and smart. We simply become stupid for the convenience of the plot.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the writing is that characters will suddenly gain character traits essentially maybe half an hour before we're shown why this character trait, they supposedly have the entire time, justified how they were behaving even if their behaviour before that point provided absolutely ZERO indication to this other than the one occasion where they're trying to convince you this was their motivation and an aspect of them the entire time. You're shown their villainy and bad actor behaviour, until a few moments before they want you to be sympathetic rather than having that sympathetic aspect always having been hinted towards.\n\nI unlike many others wasn't a massive fan of Endwalker, I didn't enjoy how rushed and poorly paced and cheap the attempts at emotional moments were in some parts. But I still enjoyed Endwalkers story ultimately, the characters felt like themselves rather than shades of themselves being used to attempt to breed familiarity. While I wasn't a fan of Endwalker, especially as opposed to Shadowbringers, I could see there were positive aspects of the storytelling, for the gripes I had with it, certainly not bad enough for me to leave a negative review, unlike here.\n\nThe second half of the expansion kind of comes out of nowhere with minimal but obvious build up. The quality of the writing independent of the annoying cat woman has gone thoroughly down the gutter and playing through it is an incredibly frustrating experience.\n\nAs for the mechanics, they're top notch. High quality, I couldn't have asked for more. Music and environments are similarly wonderfully handled, but those aspects don't make up for the dog water writing in this expansion.

But the cherry on the cake here is that this stupid fucking cat that you have attached to you like a tumour has some of the worst voice acting in the game. I'm sure there's some no named NPC what was voiced poorly in 2.0 or whatever I'm forgetting about, but they sure as hell weren't glued to you for a full expac!

Everything post Cowboy, starting with the Vanguard Dungeon up to the final boss battle i was very invested. The characters all felt great, and Wuk Lamat even had a few moments i enjoyed from her. I think if the expansion kept this the entire way through, it'd be better. Atleast i have higher hopes for post MSQ to continue this hype.\n\nThe Battle Content: It's all pretty damn good. Every single dungeon, excluding the first one, i thoroughly enjoyed. The challenge feels good, and especially the last two post MSQ dungeons feeling more difficult than an average dungeon. I feel like they nailed most encounters on the head with difficulty, mechanics and unique fights, especially after the lackluster Post-MSQ of Endwalker. Trial wise feels good too, the Trial 2 and 3 feeling great and 1 feeling, okay but a bit like filler. \n\nThe Class Changes: For the most part they all feel pretty good, or atleast look good. I haven't heard much complaint from most people, or atleast that most are Neutral, i'll list the one case which i think is bad below, but from the classes i've played, they've felt great.\n\nThe Areas- I think most of these are a pretty big hit, especially in the latter half of the expansion. The areas are gorgeous and although some feel a little bit same-y (the western-style area feeling quite bland and forgettable) i think overall i enjoyed them. Solution 9 is a massive step up to Radz-at-Han.\n\nBakool Ja Ja: I loved his redemption in the story, and the massive flip of a coin from him being a general dickhead to him just being troubled, with an awful spoiled upbringing. I think i really enjoyed what his character became, although i wish he was brought up more in the story. Characters reacting more to his change, and him needing to prove to people he wasn't the brute he was before.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1] \nThe first 70% of the Story: The first 70% of the expansion is absolutely horrendous, equally as bad as some parts of ARR or Early Stormblood. Early ARR has the excuse of being a different time, less experience, and the weight of 1.0 entirely on its back. It was also responsible for the immense worldbuilding of the game. For Dawntrail this is also true, it being a new era of the game, Post Hydie and Zodie-arc as the new expansion to introduce the next segment of our story. However even with now years of writing under their belts, it's so poorly don\n\nWuk Lamat: *close up shot of her fist clenching* Annoying. Incompetent. Forced down our throats for the entire expansion and even after her annoyingly forced multiple character arcs are over, she still shows up to steal the spotlight over and over. I wouldn't mind if they made her character better, but it's just not. Most of her growth feels strange, and very lopsided. One moment she's feeling worthless but then after two words she never looks back to that ever again until it's brought up later, but she brushes it off.  The Voice actor is sub-par and really shows a lackluster performance next to the other Scions she's so constantly put beside. Most people recommend using JP acting just for this, but even then i find Wuk Lamat to be annoyingly forced upon every single scenario. This is further exasperated because of...\n\nThe Warrior of Light: Useless. We're turned into this floppy bystander who is useless as absolute sin. The writers clearly didn't know how to handle our power level in this so they turned us into a braindead puppet. So many times we're forced to sit and watch as something awful unfolds and instead of stepping in and doing something we just watch with our mouth agape like it's something new. Watching Zoraal Ja murder his father as we sit there, watching the entire time even before being told not to, and then just letting him walk away because...we're braindead i guess? It's awful. Many other times problems could be solved by just jumping into action but instead sitting there drooling on ourselves. I'd atleast forgive it if they did these things when we aren't around, like the Blue Roegadyn guy getting backstabbed away from us. But instead of all this happening while we were in Cowboy town, they make it happen after instead of during, which makes zero sense.\n\nThe Filler Cowboy Arc: After dealing with Wuk Lamat the entire expansion, we finish her dawnservanting things and get to explode an area with Erenville, an NPC who i enjoy, but never got to do much in the first like 60% of this expansion. We get to an area that is extraordinarily boring, with a story and plot point that serves no purpose. The characters are boring that they introduce until they re-hash a problem from Shadowbringers, even referencing it themselves. The Train characters are...okay, the Hrothgar carrying with his voice acting, but every single character involved in the Sheriff/Deputy/Guy with friends wrongfully jailed feels bad. The entire idea behind it is also just...bad. The final parts with the train are..fine, and beefing up the train was cool, but it felt so awful and pointless. Very forgettable area.\n\nOtis: Why. you introduce an amazing character, with amazing voice acting. and then IMMEDIATELY waste him. You fight him in a cool fight, he comes back to our side, then DIES TO A RANDOM NOTHINGBURGER LIGHTING DOG MOB PROTECTING SOMEONE WHO IS INVINCIBLE ANYWAYS AND CAN JUST TELEPORT TO A NEW BODY. THE CHILD WHO HE WAS PROTECTING BARELY CARES HE DIED, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING TO REMEMBER HIM BY. Eventually you come across him later in the endless afterlife and he doesn't remember you until you tell him after some play thing, in an ATTEMPT to redeem him and make him feel better but this is all pointless anyways because they didn't do anything useful with an actual good character anyways. Glad he died for absolutely nothing. Would've been actually cool if he showed up in the 2nd trial and died there atleast doing something, maybe protecting the kid from his abusive father like he failed to do the first time. \n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1] \n\nSummoner: Summoner is by far the worst class for new things this expansion. They got two upgrades and a \"\"\"new\"\"\" Bahamut form at level 100. They barely had anything to say about the class, even though Endwalker left it in a troubled state post rework. It's boring. They gave it a great class personality and wonderful things, but made it so boring, that it's barely a caster. It has no depth besides holding Festers for Searing Light, and a a New Bahamut is absolutely boring as hell. It doesn't do anything new, and feels like the only class that genuinely got shafted. Like they forgot about it a month before Endwalker release.\n\nThe Unlost World: A Beautiful area made into a wasteland via the story. They did the opposite of this in Endwalker, but was done well. Here, if you want to go back to any of these areas you have to go back to NG+ to experience anything beautiful there. Doing it post MSQ for a dungeon, and Fates makes the area feel...ugly. I get the idea was that you destroyed and ended it all, but i desperately hope they do something with bringing it back to it's beauty in post MSQ or maybe a beast tribe, because as of now it looks just awful.\n\n2nd Dye Channels: I really really am disappointed with a lot of these. Not with what they chose, but with what they made dyeable on some pieces. Lots of pieces randomly have teeny tiny parts made dyeable, despite better choices existing. It's insulting to see some of the choices they made like the Adventurer's Jacket or Fat Cat Pajamas. I hope this gets improved in the future. (i know about the whole dye regions/texture limits and what not people mention, but these could clearly be updated and fixed around for pieces with awful choices.)\n\nFirst 70%: 2/10\nLast 30%:

uno de mis juegos favoritos de toda la vida con mas de 2k de horas metidas en el creo puedo dar un opinion sin que me gane la benda en los ojos de mi amor por este juego, voy a empezar con lo bueno de este expansion y de ahi remarcando lo malo\n-Lo bueno: Excelentes Dungeos y Trials, me parecieron muy divertidos, mas retadores que anteriores expansiones y mas agresivos\n-Lo Ta bien: si bien Soken nunca falla en su apartado audio esta expansion tampoco es la excepcion, muy buenas canciones y temas de batalla, aunque mi menos favorita es la que parece sacada de libro de la selva o esa que tiene tipo enfoque de disney, tal vez es porque la usan en momentos donde se siente anticlimatica oirla :s\n-Lo malo: Entiendo que la historia despues de terminar 10 anios de lore/plot twist y demas puede resultar muy dificil hacer algo nuevo y agradable pero de verdad que no puede ser mas aburrido el inicio me atrevo a decir que peor que ARR, muchas cosas innecesariamente alargadas que no aporta absolutamente en nada mas que alargar la duracion de la expasion, hay conversaciones que se repiten parafraseando lo que ya habian dicho en otra quest sin mencionar el exagerado uso de Quests basura \"habla 3 veces con estos tipos para que los conozcas\"\"consigue 3 piedritas para hacer un fueguito\", tiene algunos puntos buenos en la historia o interesantes como la historia de Kryle pero hasta ahi...\nLo peor: W-u-k L-a-m-a-t, no hay personaje mas insoportable en el juego, no se que enfoque le querian dar a esta \"protagonista\"pero a veces es tan incongruente que quiera ser lider de una nacion y ser tan ingenua y tonta y lo peor es que en toda la historia no mejora en NADA, siempre con la idea ridicula de que todos somos familia y amigos y asi que podemos ayudarnos aunque el enemigo  halla dejado en claro que nos va a petatear, sin mencionar la terrible voz que tiene, parece la voz de un tipo intentado hacer voz de mujer, que sea mal personaje tal vez sea culpa de los escritores pero no quita que su actuacion de voz tambien afecte el impacto de como la persives...\n\ny eso es todo, mi recomendacion es Skipear las primeras partes de los hombres pajaron y los peruanos, no te pierdes de absolutamente de nada, ya ahi mejora un poco la historia pero siempre re cae en ese circulo de querer hacer interesante a Lamat siguiendo sus ideales de hueva, la historia es una montana rusa donde hay mas momentos bajos que altos...\n\ncomprenlo en rebaja\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1719981961, "timestamp_updated": 1719981961, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

Personally, I didn't mind ARR, HW, or SB. Everything after that seems to be on a steep downhill trend with Dawntrail being a vertical line down instead of a slope.\n\nI know we're currently in a state where the \"big bad\" is gone and we need to pivot the story in another direction but... you're not even the main fucking character. Yes, the Warrior of Light - Saviour of several worlds, slayer of Gods, bringer of peace and destruction now relegated to being a side character to a furry with the most irritating voice I've ever heard in a video game. And I've played FF12 multiple times. Yes, \"it\" is worse than Vaan by astronomical units.\n\n\n## Class Changes\n\nTo give some context, I've been playing this slop for 10 years so I do remember how ARR/HW played.\n\nOnce again, healers are carbon copies of each other with very few distinguishing characteristics. AST got shafted again, somehow, and the others are just as dull as they were last expac.\nTanks, once again, are all carbon copy Warrior clones so you're not missing anything there.\nI can't speak for most of the DPS classes as I've not leveled them yet. However, BLM, once again, got basically nothing. Remember when we got Despair and it turned out to be just another generic combo ender? Well in Dawntrail you get... another generic combo ender. They also screwed mana regeneration on BLM. They also removed Sharpcast from BLM because juggling procs is too hard for the average person, apparently.\n\nAs for the new classes, Viper is dragoon and Pictomancer runs on a priority system similar to classes like MCH/BRD when they were actually fun to play.\n\nSo, all in all, you got mostly nothing from this expac except the number next to your level was increased by 10.\n\n\n## Battle Content\n\nAs usual from SE, this expac is just like every other expac after ARR. You get a dungeon every odd level, you get 2 trials during the campaign, you unlock 2 dungeons and 2 Extreme trials after the campaign.\n\nIt's been nearly a decade since HW launched and this company can't seem to shake up anything except lower your expectations.\n\n\n## Other Content\n\nThere is no other content.\nYou can level your DoH/DoL just like every other expac after SB - spam turn ins for scrips, maybe do your GC dailies, etc.\n\n\n## Overall/Final Comments\n\nThis expansion is version 7.0. It's been 5 expacs since ARR was a thing and this company is still putting this game out on a schedule that's almost a decade old. As noted previously, every expac after HW seems to homogenize the roles even more. Job identity has been thrown out the window in pursuit of streamlining everything into carbon copies. I've been maining BLM since HW and the class hasn't fundamentally changed. I created an alt character to main healer roles in Savage raids and they've homogenized ALL the healers to a point where it's just not fun to press the same button for 90% of any content. I can't even get excited for my favorite tank, DRK, because I remember how much fun it was to play before it became a WAR clone.\n\nThis game isn't taking any risks. It's not innovating. It's not doing anything new. It's the same stale crap with a new wrapper. The only risk SE is taking is letting a transwoman voice the main character in this expansion since you're just being carted around on someone else's story. A boring, bland fucking story.

This will be an ongoing review and I will update this likely after 7.3 and 7.5. This is a very, VERY mid expansion at best. There are definitely some good things about this expansion, but the bad vastly outweighs it in my opinion. \n\nLet's start with the good. The dungeons and trials are arguably some of the best the game has ever had. A perfect mix of spectacle and difficulty mixed with an amazing soundtrack really keeps you hyped up through the entire time. The zones are (mostly) beautiful. The graphical update really makes everything look so much better and I really enjoyed marveling at all the new textures and lighting effects. The music is also (mostly) good. Soken rarely misses with his tracks, but some don't quite hit the mark, but i'll get to that soon. The role quests are also really enjoyable, but that may be just because it gave me an excuse to leave behind the MSQ for a bit. \n\nNow on to the bad. The story is, for lack of a better word, bad. At best, it felt like I was playing through a long chain of side quests, and at worst, a poorly written, self-insert fanfic. I genuinely believe that this stems from the change of Main Scenario writers that happened after EW. I'm fully aware that more often than not, a writer change after finishing a major story can be good to bring fresh eyes to the story going forward, but this didn't feel like a good move here. And before people say I rushed or skipped cutscenes, no. I watched every single cutscene and played through every dungeon and trial that I could with NPC's to keep myself immersed. The story just wasn't good. Wuk Lamat was a fun character at first that felt like a shonen anime protagonist, but the more time I spent listening and interacting with her, the less I liked her. Her character growth happened early and she never really grew after that. She was the epitome of every boring shonen anime trope rolled into one character. Family and friends are her power and everyone is her family/friend. I want to like her, I really do, but I just don't. \n\nUnfortunately, she's not even the worst character of the expansion. Zoraal Ja and Soreel Ja are arguably the biggest wasted characters. I won't say much without spoilers, but the \"twist\" with these characters was only shocking because of all the lost potential. Also, you remember when everybody was excited to find out about Krile's past and see how she grows as a character? Yea, that mostly happens off screen. She definitely got more screen time, but mostly in weird ways, like giving her an Echo vision just for her to tell us that Zoraal Ja is super emo. Not what I would call character growth if you ask me.\n\nI mentioned some of the music being subpar before, so let's touch on that. Some of the music, specifically the music used at the end of the Succession Rite and after defeating the final boss during Erenville's monologue, just feels very out of place. It has a weird Lion King/Jungle Book vibe that just doesn't fit. Sure it sounds victorious in a way, but it also just doesn't sound like it has a place in this expansion. \n\nI will end this by saying that I genuinely hope that this is just a Stormblood situation where the story is mid (although I really liked the Stormblood story) and the combat and post-MSQ stuff will carry it, but for now, this ranks at the bottom of my FFXIV list. I genuinely enjoyed ARR more than I did this expansion so far, and I hate saying that. If you did enjoy it, I'm super happy for you that it struck your fancy.

The characters are neither as enticing as in previous expansions, nor are their motivations well-established. I find it interesting when the Scions interject in the dialogue with, \"Hmm, wait a minute. I was thinking that if you do this, won't you just be doomed to fail?\" Meanwhile, the antagonist of whichever storyline would just scoff and simply say, \"Whatever, bro.\"\n\nGood writing is characterized by several key elements that enhance clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. In past expansions, relevance and depth were key points that established why the characters would act in a certain manner. This expansion maintains that in a very sporadic manner. Some antagonists do have their motivations and reasoning, but they lack sophistication. They act like toddlers, which is strange given that previous antagonists all had some sort of reason for their actions. Even in the 6.x patches, the characters had this basic fundamental.\n\nI see a lot of reviewers pointing out that this isn\u2019t Endwalker; it\u2019s a new chapter, etc. But tell me, when an author of a book changes their writing style, appeals to naivety, and references the previous expansions poorly, why is this given a pass? This isnt ARR, which is funny because the narrative of ARR builds upon the events of 1.0. Characters who survived the Calamity often refer to the past events and their experiences during the original game's timeline. Scattered throughout the world of ARR are memorials and remnants of the original game. These serve as in-game acknowledgments of the past and the transition to the new era.  Why cant it be done here? This new chapter in our adventure? \n\nI won't continue to explain why the expansion is a bad addition, but when I talked with someone else, they brought up an interesting point. This isn't XIV for those who played the game and waited for the expansion. This is XIV for those who are new and have completed the story and crave more content. I can see that being a valid case. However, the characters and the story itself are too poor. It's as if you were served a five-star meal and then given a two-star appetiser. For us, we were waiting a while for the five-star appetiser. Instead, we got something moldy and uncooked.

I have always played XIV for the story & plot that has been robust over the years (even with weaker entries such as Stormblood), but never has it reached the abysmal level that even I am skipping cutscenes for the first time in my XIV history.\n\nThe first half of Dawntrail's story is mind-numbingly boring with genuinely 0 interesting characters or any worthwhile developments - to call it a \"necessary lore dump\" because it's the start of a new story arch is immeasurable cope. For hours on end, you are doing nothing more than running from A to B, listening to Wuk Lamat talk about how she respects people and wants peace, you kill 1 quest enemy, then rinse & repeat for 20 hours. \nOther reviews have already pointed out how Wuk Lamat is a comically bad character from a writing standpoint, rightfully earning her the Mary Sure title (something that other characters are vying for in this expansion.)\n\nAt risk of potential spoilers, the antagonists of Dawntrail's story are no better than the main character (which is not the player, mind you, but one of the worst written characters I've had the displeasure of having to see). The second antagonist is marginally better, but still lacks any interesting or redeeming qualities, going so far as to feel like the male equivalent of a Mary Sue, going from 0 to 100 power in a matter of 1 quest. (If you know, you know)\nWithout going into too much detail, the final part of the story serves no purpose and feels like nothing more than a time waster - 6th zone & it's story could be cut from the expansion and nothing would change. \n\nTo summarize the story & narrative aspect of Dawntrail, I genuinely believe after 3000-ish hours of playtime that this is the worst written, lowest quality, least interesting *slop* that has somehow managed to see the light of day. \n\nThis is not to say that Dawntrail only has negative aspects - both the leveling and high-level dungeons, and trials are refreshingly enjoyable to run, seemingly achieving the wanted \"middle-level\" difficulty between an AFK-run and an extreme trial. The mechanics (a lot of which are reskins / reused, mind you) are enjoyable to play with, and provide just enough difficulty to provide a healthy challenge without going too far into sweat territory. \n\nTo wrap up a mostly negative review - the characters & story is nothing but a shadow of it's former self, but the gameplay side of the expansion does bring welcome additions to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1719956514, "timestamp_updated": 1719957019, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508915305137634277", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168823156", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971280361", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat don't feel i need to say more.", "timestamp_created": 1719956190, "timestamp_updated": 1719956190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472391843795776367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168822067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041822580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's boring.

Endwalker was amazing and the story has always been something I have thoroughly enjoyed. However, as much as I wanted to like Dawntrail (Coming in knowing full well the story wouldn't be as grand as Shadowbringers and Endwalker), I sadly cannot recommend this expansion. I have completely finished the MSQ and done some post content and the expansion just falls flat. Many of the new zones are way too similar and the story can be incredibly dull at times.

Wuk Lamat overstays her welcome and just never ceases to talk over other characters and hijack their storylines. \n\nThere are signs here that this expansion wanted to do something new.

Shifting the player's position within the storytelling from a sidelines character like in ARR, Heavenward and Stormblood to the center stage main character within the story. I was hoping that while Dawntrail was expected to be relatively low stakes, you know summer vacation after saving the world. I was expecting a light-hearted fun romp through the Main Scenario Quests, but not this.\n\nDawntrail's story has done the complete opposite tonal shift, and it does not do it well. It could've been executed better, but the jarring shift of the Warrior of Light character from main character back to side character is the biggest note that this expansion type is returning, probably what was seen as the 'safest route' at the time since everyone has to cut their teeth when working on a MMO with a core foundation in story, to the roots of the storytelling. This is the Warrior of Light's summer vacation, but you're no longer the main character. You've been sidelined to probably the goofiest furball of shonen anime tropes that I've ever seen. It's not even the good tropes that make shonen anime characters memorable, it's all of the bad ones. Not one ounce of Wuk Lamat is redeemable at this point, unless there's a severe story shift for her story at the start of the Post Main Scenario Quests that should be starting up in 7.1.\n\nTruly the first time I've ever had a mixed feeling on the overall story, no spoilers, but while it is the longest slow burn to start it picks up fairly quickly, encounters a slight stall to pad out the story while introducing the most stereotypical american tropes, and then overstays it's welcome near the end. \n\nNew dungeons are fantastic, environments have never looked this good in any expansion for FFXIV previously. The new Trials are very interesting and mechanically sound, I think there's been a slight random number generator applied to bosses for when to use their abilities. They truly feel randomly applied rather than following a mindnumbing scripted sequence of execution as in previous expansions. I love it. I'll edit this once I've experienced the new raid.\n\nNew classes are great, but have downsides. Two red dps classes means that there's a low population count of people playing blue dps or green dps so queues are much longer for duty finder, but this should even out fairly quickly. While I haven't played Viper myself yet, all of it's abilities make it seem like it's a very fast combo oriented class.\n\nPictomancer, however, is my new main job for FFXIV going forward. It is a fantastic blend of high damage numbers from Black Mage, support abilities from Summoner, and utility of Red Mage. It is the most interesting caster job in FFXIV to date, and I hold it highly because it's so comically, and beautifully executed both in class lore, spell animations, and mechanics. You have your long cast ability, whether it's the combo that cycles through fire, aero and water abilities to generate white paint so you can use a AE ability, and adds paint to the meter so you can use subtractive palette to grant access to 'darker colors' to deal even more damage through a combo rotation of ice, earth, and thunder magic. There's motifs that are long cast spells in combat, and instant when outside of combat that prep you to use your power 'drawing' spells, the bonk hammer is amazing. I recommend Pictomancer to anyone who has been put off by the other selection of casters within the game. Oh, and there's moogles that fire laser beams from their faces.\n\nDo I recommend Dawntrail? Not really, it's definitely on the low end of my list but I am of the player base that didn't like Stormblood all that much either. Unless you fancy to have a trip through Tural with Furry Jar Jar Binks. There's one character that is introduced as an antagonist early on, and I hope that the Post-MSQs focus on that character more than Wuk.

Sadly, my WoL gets dialogue options that simply shit on that character, and these reactions just exist for the previously mentioned polarizing character to show us the power of friendship, which instantly turn the flawed character into the most loyal and best friend, within a single cutscene, all with the power of talk.

In terms of encounter design, this is the best base-expansion so far; all of the dungeons are high quality as well. Everything reeks of effort, and you can feel the developers flexing their 10 years of experience in every fold of its design. This applies to everything\u2014except, unfortunately, the story.\n\nIt's a very unusual experience for me to come away from an FFXIV expansion launch impressed by everything except the one thing I expected to be impressed by. If you don't care about the story, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this expansion. However, if the story is the primary draw for you, then you can probably sit this one out.\n\nI didn't expect the story to match the highs of \"Shadowbringers\" or \"Endwalker,\" but I had at least expected \"Heavensward/Stormblood\" quality. Yet, what I got was a story that struggled to compare even to the mediocrity of \"A Realm Reborn.\" Every part of the story and storytelling felt amateurish and uninspired. All the subtlety of the previous expansions' writing seems to have left alongside Ishikawa. Characters will look directly into the camera and explain themselves, multiple times. I'm unsure if this sudden twist on the old \"show, don't tell\" wisdom is because the writing team collectively forgot how writing works, or whether they think I'm a cognitively maladapted troglodyte incapable of understanding implication or subtext. Either way, writing of this poor quality is not what I've come to expect from this development team.\n\nThe traditional cast of characters is all here, yet all of their complexity and personality have been unceremoniously stripped away. This is fine, I suppose, considering none of them had the requisite screen time necessary to explore their characters anyway. \"Dawntrail\" sacrifices everyone and everything for the sake of giving Wuk Lamat more screen time, a baffling decision considering how much of a non-character she is. If you don't love Wuk Lamat, which admittedly some people do, then this expansion has nothing in terms of story to offer you. Besides, of course, a final villain with a philosophy so vacuously grandiloquent it feels written specifically to imply something profound is being said, while desperately hoping you don't think too much or too critically about it, lest it shatter under the mildest reflection or scrutiny.\n\nThis is the only MSQ, ARR included, from which I came away having enjoyed no part. At least \"Stormblood\" had its moments, as did ARR, but \"Dawntrail's\" story offers me nothing: mediocre at best, 2009 YouTube machinima without the charm of novelty at worst. The only way I can explain what the \"Dawntrail\" story is like is to imagine \"Stormblood\" without Kugane/Doma, Azim Steppe, Sadu, Magnai, Hien, Yotsuyu, Zenos, or Fordola. It's just Lyse, being duct-taped to you for 30+ hours straight. If you *really* love Lyse, that might sound appealing. If you're planning on playing \"Dawntrail,\" you better pray to God you end up *really* Loving Wuk Lamat, because if not, you'll be in for an experience that will redefine your understanding of the term \"obnoxious.\"\n\nAnd yet, with all this being said, I can't help but still be optimistic for the future. I love this game and always will, and I have full confidence the team will learn from this failure, or at the very least, fire the lunatic responsible for this abomination of an MSQ.", "timestamp_created": 1719926682, "timestamp_updated": 1719926682, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474774658679962158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168780527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963480120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hay un poco de gameplay en mis cutscenes de relleno.", "timestamp_created": 1719925886, "timestamp_updated": 1719925886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426384836435317993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168780342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025449935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "if you enjoyed endwalker post-msq, you'll enjoy this. you shouldn't have enjoyed endwalker post-msq.\nHopefully post-msq can save it like stormblood.\nDragonflight tier writing, Wuk Lamat obnoxious but ignorable.

A secondary character in a story dedicated to the adventure you have. I was sceptical about it but it kinda makes sense. If you actually did it right. \n\nSo now the strongest thing in this expansion is Wuk Lamat. Excluding the drama about VA and all that crap. This character is poorly written and fleshed out regardless of growth over the expansion. The main driver is that the individual believes they can achieve peace through resolving everything via boring you with (fetch quests, being secondary, hanging out with them 24/7, listening them to solve problems and forgiving people for serious crimes.) \n\nHere's the most common example I can think of ahead in the story with spoiler tags.\n[spoiler]Take Bakool Ja Ja who releases the van bird in trial 1, he gives you a sob story of why he's such a piece of shit and then everyone goes from kill this fool to i forgive you bro\". Like what? Are we forgiving the potential of secondary assistance to mass genocide now?[/spoiler]\n\nFinal Fantasy: Recycle Content\nOnce more we don't innovate and keep to the same working strategy. 10 dungeons, 3 trials, same quests, no dialogue expansions. Innovation is limited to a graphical update. (pssst, did you know gshade existed for many years and did all this?) [spoiler]even the final trial is just FF14 Shadowbringers Normal Shiva cutscene when gaia breaks the glass ceiling to enter the fight and carry us to win!!![/spoiler]. Same grind again.\n\nThe Slog Story\nHalf of this story surrounding the ascension revolves around watching Wuk Lamat grow into a leader. But it's watching a series of luck and unrealistic ideals. Meant to attach you to the character but instead pushes you away because they're so pathetic and the humour is forced. The other characters we love get minimal screen time because you split up 24/7 and its you and wuk and my sanity dying.\n\nThe good story shit thats short for no reason\nThe second half is actually interesting, [spoiler]the new faction that comes into play and the realm is so tiny. It's limited to a merging of worlds and one complex of cyberpunk-ish like world. This is way more interesting. Flying bikes? robot warriors? the soul system? give me this! Why is this so short? So we can listen to Wuk Lamat thats why. Thats the budget. Pray for patches. This faction is so interesting. [/spoiler] This should've been 3/4's and prefably  [spoiler] remove wuk lamat from the party after ascension[/spoiler]\n\nI will say the fights, trials dungeons are fun but I don't think they're innovative. They just throw piss orange on the floor. But I guess we've exhausted creativity.\n\nSoken music bangers as always, but cannot carry the other problems in this expansion.

The patch content is promising a lot to do for endgame which is awesome especially since we're getting away from EW which had the worst endgame to date. \n\nCon's: You probably already know what im going to say but im going to say it again. This story is borderline hot crap, i mean a real dookie on the pavement, having done the pre-release i was extremely hype for this, but i found myself contemplating on quitting the game over how garbage the beginning of it was. By almost all standards this was one massive beast tribe quest. I had more engagement and interest in ARR then i did this expansion as far as the story goes. Please tell me again why the main character is goddamn Wuk Lamat, like every. goddamn. cut scene. had this dumb annoying terrible VA character in it and i found myself skipping dialogue at times because i could already guess what she was going to say. The only redeeming part of the story was anytime that we were about to do a dungeon/trial, every other part was a fetch quest/filler.\n\nAnother issue is classes, this has been a on going issue with almost every expansion, every expansion the classes become more and more of a snooze fest, tanks are absolutely in a abyssal state rn with their abilities being the most boring simple thing ever, dps rotations are becoming almost as easy as a tanks. Now as far as healers go this might get me in hot doodoo with the community but they have no room to complain, the dungeons minus the first one had very hard and punishing raid wides, and as a dps main i dont pay attention to my health, so if im noticing my health going down then yeah its getting a bit freaky.\n\nMy biggest concern/disdain for the state of the game currently however is the condition of the game for new players, im talking people starting in ARR, we've got 5 whole expansion after ARR that new players HAVE to go through in order to get to good content, i get it, its a final fantasy game, the story is going to be very important, however the average person does not want to sit through hundreds on hundreds of hours of dialogue just to get to good/current content. Not allowing new players to start at a expansion that is meant to be a completely new start for the game is very concerning, if they keep this up the game will not last.\n\nOverall i'd rate this a 7/10, the gameplay is amazing, the map design is amazing, the graphics are a massive improvement, and the fights are badass.

If you pick this up, do yourself a favor and SKIP through the story and just read the cut scene summaries at the inn.\n\nThe Good:\nThe visuals are gorgeous. The graphics update is amazing.\n\nThe class mechanics are smoothed out for the most part.\n\nThe new classes are fun.\n\nThe dungeon fights are a challenge now.\n\nTrials have brand new mechanics.\n\nThree expansions of story in one.\n\nWhat few action scenes there are, are really well done.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nThe main gameplay loop outside of instanced dungeons is a downgrade from the previous expansions. Back to lots of talking, with very few action scenes.\n\nYoshi took the #HealerStrike personal. Bosses will have three or four mechanics launch at the same time. Getting hit by two is game over. The Warrior of Light meets Cup Head.\n\nYour character could be removed from the story and nothing would change.\n\nThe story is in three parts: A tour of the new land, the people, and their culture based on South American history. An invasion from a \"foreign\" power for part 2. And... something out of an acid trip for the finale.\n\nThe pacing is bad: over 2/3's of the story is spent on the first act. It is a slow, painful slog to get through it all.\n\nThen there are two entire expansion packs worth of story packed into the last 1/3 of the story. Characters are introduced, then act like they are best buddies, then stab you in the back, then die in an \"emotional\" scene in the same quest.\n\nThe voice acting from the entire cast ranges from \"I'm here for the paycheck\" to \"oh god my ears!\" Honestly, AI voices would have been better 90% of the time.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe story is horrendous.\n\nThe overall story is about a girl boss whom everyone loves, can do anything, is the key to everything, and whose \"arc\" is learning she just needs to gain self-confidence in her girl boss powers. Slay queen, slay! Think Lyse from Storm Blood but way worse.\n\nAnd yes, you are side lined in your own story. The Warrior of Light goes from \"I eat gods for breakfast\" to \"I better stay out of this fight, I might get hurt!\"\n\nThe first part of the story is a tour of a land based on South America. SE was so afraid of the woke mob that they had \"consultants\" help. I looked them up, and the only Latin American experience they have is the drive thru at Taco Bell.\n\nSo first part feels like a combination of someone pulling data points from Wikipedia, combined with what a Hollywood writer thinks about Mexico. And in typical Cali liberal fashion, it tries to avoid racism so badly that it loops back and becomes racist. The merchant clan all have big noses and are obsessed with profit! The culturally significant cuisine is Tex Mex. Whitey doesn't spice their food. etc.\n\nAdd in the girl boss doing cute girl boss things, and boy howdy is the first act a boring slog.\n\nThen, people say things pick up in the second act. They are wrong. It is a barely disguised allegory for Western Colonialism. You literally have a \"technologically strong foreign power from the North\" that was built using slave labor and needs to exploit the 3rd world to survive, complete with a FREAKING BORDER WALL that you smash down with an Underground Railroad! Oh, did I mention the Trump stand in? Yes, we get TDS in this expac, complete with a J6 election denial allegory!\n\nAnd of course you join the communist \"rebel\" group to take the place down from the inside. While Girl Boss is being bestest ever buddies with the evil colonial leader at the same time! It makes no sense beyond \"the story has to have evil colonialists in it because West is bad.\"\n\nAnd what would be an entire expansion's worth of lore is smashed into one zone. I'm kind of thankful for that, as there is less pain.\n\n\"Surely things couldn't get worse in the 3rd act, right?\" Oh, how about literally deconstructing Heaven so you can fight Chat GPT! And yes, it comes out of nowhere. Literally beating the boss of the 2nd act, and everyone is like \"where'd character X go? Oh, must be in this AI generated afterlife in this space ship that crashed decades ago that we just learned about!\" Yes, it is that jarring. No, there is no further discourse on the issue. Just \"we beat Trump!\" to \"we have to beat up girl boss Jesus in the alien AI afterlife.\"\n\n*head desk*\n\n\nIn short, the story is hot woke garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1719900273, "timestamp_updated": 1719900273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432708054780960083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168753500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072353528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Where's Poochie?", "timestamp_created": 1719899383, "timestamp_updated": 1719899383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504869997501373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168753495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077533409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Escort Wuk Lamat.\nTalk to Wuk Lamat.\nBaby sit this mother fucker for the entire story. \n\nMinor combat changes, nothing to call exciting.

I like taking a slower pace for an expansion, it feels like a return to ARR. I like the glam, the quests, the story, it's all fine so far and I'm excited for what new patches and expansions will bring. \n\nMy only point of contention really is the horrible character we are bound to for the entirety of the story, it's not even the character really it's the fact that I have to play with the audio on mute. I disliked Minfillia's flat tone, but I would give anything to have Bolton back voicing Wuk Lumat instead of Bryer. They don't have any range, the accent is weird, and their poor voice acting stands out badly. I feel like I'm suddenly playing something straight off of Josh Strife Hayes 'Worst MMO's Series'. For a game that typically has fantastic casting with characters such as Venat, Graha, Estinien, Haurchefant (and the entirety of the Heavensward cast tbh), Zenos, Lyse, Papashan, Raubahn, etc, etc I could go on and on. This really is a weird casting choice for someone so central. To the point I wonder if they did ANY play tests with people who were not US loca employees. If it were a more minor character or a side character it would honestly have been a fine casting choice, but the amount and range the role requires, and how much we are interacting with them, really make the many flaws stand out.

This has nothing to do with \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" - this is straight-forward laziness. There is nothing even remotely interesting new going on in the crafting & gathering department. Battle system changes have made combat even more boring and streamlined.\n- Apart from the two post-MSQ dungeons, which introduce at least some new, fun mechanics, the instance fail to break out of the stale \"double-pull -> mini-boss -> double-pull -> mini-boss -> double-pull -> final boss\" scaffold. Missed opportunities and, again, laziness whereever one looks.\n- I have never seen so _little_ action going on in the main story quest. It is as if the content creation department had been halved and replaced by AI-bullcrap dialogue generators. This has, to some degree, been present in 6.1 to 6.55 as well, but it is worse than ever before.\n\nAs a Veteran in this game for 10 years now, I can say that this is too little to carry the game for the next two years.

But it's a lot more of the same wrapped in what could possibly be the most boring storyline of the franchise, surpassing even Stormblood. To call it a \"slow burn\" is being generous; it's unintentionally comical how uninspired it is. I had my first concerns when the trailer's music had lyrics reminiscent of a children's Saturday morning cartoon show, only to be confirmed by how aggressively dull and irrelevant the MSQ is. For these reasons, since the story is the bulk of the expansion's content and the gameplay has received very little innovation, I give it a thumbs-down.\n\nJob updates are a very mixed bag, with healer mains seeming to be generally disgruntled and/or bored. I can't speak much on that from recent experience, but the healer subforum is worth a read to understand their woes. Seems a real shame, as I've long considered FFXIV healer jobs to be the most fun of any healer classes I've played in any other game, but I suppose the proof is in the pudding now that I just don't play them. However, as a RDM main, I'm pretty happy with the new 90-100 stuff, even if it doesn't expand heavily on the job's complexity. The addition of Grand Impact via Accession is the biggest winner for me.\n\nIt's worth noting that this \"healer strike,\" while it may or may not be as prevalent as the vocal minority would have you believe, has *some* effect on the queue times for DPS, which at present are often atrocious. This is only compounded by the fact that both new classes are fighting for DPS spots too.\n\nThe new dungeon/trial bosses are fun, but dungeons in general are more of the same. While that cookie-cutter format is to be expected, and I suppose I should judge based on their visual quality, the enjoyment I get from some of the game's presentation is marred heavily by how little I enjoyed the rest, propped up only by the mostly bangin' soundtrack, as usual.\n\nIt just feels like some of the magic is gone. \"Maybe it's just me,\" I thought, but the reviews already posted here confirmed my hope that it wasn't. I mean, really, why did we even go to this continent whose name I fail to remember? Even with (and partly because of) the tedious world-building, I couldn't muster a care about Wuk Lamat, which led me to skipping nearly every cutscene before it even gets off the ground (moreso after realizing they almost never do). The worst offenses of the MSQ are the unskippable history lessons (there's even a quiz) and the sneak-behind quests which are, at least, thankfully short.  \n\nAs mentioned in other negative reviews, the WoL and the Scions take so much of a backseat they may as well be off the bus, and in an attempt to get us acquainted with the star of the show and the culture of the continent, it turned into a long filler episode. Towards the end it gets flashier and more interesting, but that's a loooot of skipped cutscenes.\n\nSpeaking of Wuk Lamat and unintentional comedy, I *did* watch the entire cutscene of her [spoiler]inviting the Warrior of Light outside to talk about something in private. I half expected some sort of awkward love interest, but instead was treated to a montage scene of the last couple hours of story, including something that happened just seconds ago, followed by her big reveal on how life-changing it's been. How old are you, and how long did that take you to realize? I had to put my controller down and have a bit of a sad chuckle to myself. It's not like she's lived in a particularly hostile social environment. Her character doesn't make much sense, and all of her supposedly emotional moments felt very... modern Disney.[/spoiler]\n\nMy only intrigue at this point is the upcoming patch content, which will eventually include an Alliance raid based around FFXI's Vana'diel. But knowing me, I suspect it'll be too little too late to keep me justifying a sub. \n\nDevs, please listen to your community now that we have our hands on this expansion.

That's not to say that Wuk hasn't earned what she has gained but, given she pretty much completes her main goals by the time you are completing the level 94 MSQs, to me at least it felt as if her story is a bit undercooked, she pretty much stops growing as a character by this time too, despite the claims made by said character in dialogue during cutscenes.\n\nAs for the WoL and returning cast they kind of have very little relevance to the story moving forward outside of Krile and Erenville; the story fails to establish any form of attachment or meaning for the WoL to even be present or involved, so far I feel as if my WoL is but a mere bystander or observer to what is unfolding. If anything it reminds me of how WoW does their \"stories\" in which for WoW the player character is entirely absent from cutscenes or has little to no involvement in things moving forward other than a minor mention; this isn't entirely the case for FFXIV: Dawntrail but it definitely stepped in that direction which is not a good sign.\n\nSimply put, it's incredibly mid at best, possibly worse than Stormblood's basegame MSQ overall. I do believe this is quite possibly the weakest expansion MSQ-wise we have had so far.\n\n[hr]\nFor the dialogue and English voice-acting, the voice-acting is alright for the most part however for Wuk Lamat specifically seeing how she is essentially the main character for the expansion pack, the voice actor for Wuk Lamat did an okay job overall for the voiced scenes but comes across as very monotone/flat in some instances. I believe they could have done better but I'd chalk the shortcomings on the possibility that the voice actor was not given enough direction during certain segments. \n\nAs for the dialogue for both voiced and non-voiced scenes, the quality seems to have been eroded somewhat in comparison to Endwalker, with certain elements straying into Stormblood's morally preachy themes albeit being more hamfisted and put out with far less grace but with also very little relevance to the player's own WoL or their party for the most part; as if the NPCs are simply saying, 'this is what I want', 'this is how things should be', 'this is what is right', without very little feedback from the player. Your WoL's agency as a character is greatly diminished as the passivity of the WoL has been increased a lot more, allowing other characters to take the initiative more often than not; but to also state or do things without consequence, as your WoL just stands there watching things happen, good or bad, instead of engaging and taking action right the way. The WoL has become for the most part in Dawntrail, incredibly almost purely reactive to a fault.\n\nNow, as for the gameplay side of things? I mean, it's alright. At least they've made normal dungeons not as boring as they were in Endwalker and the new trials are fun.\n\nAs for the graphics update, it is good. Things look nicer for the most part, it's a step in the right direction.\n\n[hr]\nBut to be fair, seeing how this is the start of a new 'arc' for FFXIV, this is a very rough start so far, especially if we compare this and every other new expansion pack to that of Shadowbringers and it's MSQ, which was pretty much the best thing since sliced bread. \n\nAnd before anyone decides to go ahead and mention \"But A Realm Reborn\" or even bother comparing ARR to DT, ARR was a brand new game and back then had a different design approach and a different set of design goals. DT is merely an expansion pack and can take advantage of the newer design approaches and goals that CBU3 has for FFXIV. \n\nYes, 'A Realm Reborn' was a slog at parts and it was very long, but it had to do a shed load of world-building amongst other things; Dawntrail isn't an entire brand new start for the WoL or the returning cast, or even the world of FFXIV, it is built upon the foundations of what came before it, so it at least has a solid starting point that ARR generally didn't have, especially since the New World has been talked about in FFXIV before Dawntrail entered production. \n\nDawntrail being a 'brand new arc' is not a valid excuse for this expansion not walking out the gates with a stride and not avoiding fluffy sloggy story-telling; especially due to Shadowbringers, with that expansion having to world-build the entirety of The First ontop of everything else which is impressive what they pulled off; lightning in a bottle? Probably.\n\nSo since they've already showed us what they are capable of with Shadowbringers; it's safe to say that Dawntrail's start is lacklustre which is only made worse with the pacing and tempo being very inconsistent, dragging on a lot due to the amount of fluff jammed into the MSQ; the main selling point of the expansion pack for a lot of people. Which was a problem at the start of Endwalker's MSQ too for some players, myself included. However, Endwalker's MSQ was like that of a snowball getting bigger and faster, as it gained momentum going down the hill, accelerating as it headed for the finish line. Dawntrail's MSQ seems to just not know what kind of pacing it wants to go at.\n\n[hr]\nHere's hoping this is another Stormblood situation, where the post-launch content rocks, cause so far the start of this expansion hasn't really impressed beyond how it looks. But just because it looks pretty, doesn't mean there's much beyond past the surface, so yes, Dawntrail right now is as shallow as a shiny puddle.", "timestamp_created": 1719875836, "timestamp_updated": 1719890648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507466316223144531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168733446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980326592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Good lord, this is terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1719875755, "timestamp_updated": 1719875755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464551806449890137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168733362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091719433", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat is literally insufferable", "timestamp_created": 1719875659, "timestamp_updated": 1719875659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501382887363433838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168732790", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993458450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Does not even come close to living up to the writing of Shadowbringers and Endwalker", "timestamp_created": 1719875039, "timestamp_updated": 1719875039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410554260015487671", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168730868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059204805", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an expansion where you need to go in with a different lense than before;\n\nNo longer do you enter an expansion story with the stakes and everything being known.

This is a new story, and people need to understand this. Having said that... the story is clearly split into two parts. Without giving too much spoilers, the first part feels great at first. Then it drags on, and the Scions are basically irrelevant. It's super annoying. But then you enter the 2nd part and things start going HARD. While at a micro level you can say X Y or Z are annoying, like the Scions still not being relevant or used for anything other than Trial Trusts. Overall I enjoyed the second part WAY more. You will know when you get there.\n\nFirst part story: 4/10\n2nd part story: 8/10\n\nDungeon desgin: 8/10 (only downside is some really awkward 2-unit packs. Feels like we ARR again...)\nTrials: 8/10\nRaid: 8/10\nOverall combat experience: 8/10, really refreshing combat mechanics add this expansion. You can really see their new philosophy.\n\nClasses are OK, nothing really changed too much. Feels like they didn't want to change too much so they could focus on the job changes in 8.0 without having to worry too much changing balance in Dawntrail. 6/10, just more Endwalker, but better QoL.\n\nMusic: 9/10, except for that stupid High School Music song with the vocals. That specific song is an actual 1/10, muted the game every time that came on. Extremely cringe.\n\n_____________________________\n\nAs you can see, most of it is good. I timed it and the entire MSQ took me 47 hours and 5 minutes. However, I spent a good 30 hours not liking what was happening, actually feeling like I was back in Stormblood questioning wtf the writers were thinking. Feels like World of Warcraft writing.\n\nBecause of those horrible 30 hours, I'm giving it a thumbs down to send a message to the writers. Again, EVERTYHING ELSE is GOOD, if not the best version of it we have ever had (combat). But I shouldn't be required to sit through 30 hours of WoW writing for it.

I didn't go into Dawntrail with the expectation that it would blow my mind with how amazing it was, I was expecting something similar to ARR. Instead I got something more frustrating and boring then SB, which prior to this release was by many considered the worst instalment.\n\nI am also not opposed to the notion of getting to know different people's belief's and culture, this has been a staple of FF14 since ARR and is enjoyable to a degree. My main problem is with how forcibly they inserted this into 2/3rd's of Dawntrail's story and kept repeatedly preaching the importance of acceptance and understanding. It makes me wonder just how much was changed and influenced by DEI consultation firms, and how much more this game will be influenced in the future. I have to deal with these topics on a nearly daily basis, and having it forced in my face with obvious resemblances to groups in reality is too jarring and an obvious ploy to push an agenda.\n\nThat tangent out of the way. the entirety of the story is an unmemorable escort mission. You spend all the time up to level 98 visiting the many different tribes doing tests that all boil down to one thing, learn about that tribes history and culture and prove Wuk Lamat's intentions to rule while continuing to respect their ways of life. Once the ruler of Tural is decided the story does start to pick up, mostly cause of how different it is compared to the previous 30 or so hours of content. Sadly the lectures of friendship and understanding doesn't quite end even as your fighting a world ending threat, so while I did enjoy the last few hours it doesn't make up for the rest of the expansions story.\n\nNot much to say about the gameplay, as I'm sure anyone reading this review is well aware of how ff14 plays at this point. I do however want to say that despite what the developers said they wanted to make the content more challenging, I haven't noticed any improvements in that regard. Though that might be thanks to the 9,606.4 hours I spent into the game, this might change once alliance raids and savage comes out.\n\nFor these reasons I can't recommend this expansion to people that like and care about story in their games. For people that don't care these reasons won't apply, as they'll be skipping all the text anyways.

In short, its... Meh.\n\nThe start of the Story is REALLY REALLY SLOW and tedious, i was never bored more in my life than here. After the Initial entry and on the way to the mid part the Story starts picking up the pace and becomes much more interesting. Personally, i have no problem with Wuk Lamat and everyone who say like: \"Our character and the others didn't do much here\" Yes, because its at that point not really our story, we are the sidekicks or \"the Friend of the Hero\" at this moment. I really like how the Siblings worked together to beat that Sky Snake and it appeared everyone of them actually has Proper Motives. Koana i like a lot, Wuk Lamat comes over as compassionate and Zoraal Ja is a Dick but it appears there is more behind that Cold shell of his... Haha... we will come back to this piece of Dumpster Fire character later. \n\nI liked a lot how we got to know why this one tribe so much Believed in Two-Headed Ja\u00b4s to be superior and fixed that as well. The Doungens so far were quite nice and okay. At the End of, let's call it Part 1, was VERY Satisfying. Wuk Lamat has grown a lot, same has Koana and I really loved how Wuk Lamat wanted Koana to be with her Dawnserpant, Head of Season and Resolf like before, two Head to Rule the Country, each of them complimenting each other. \n\nHaha... Now we come to the Dumpsterfire that is Part 2... And Holy shit... they fumbled the Ball so badly i kind of dont want more of that story...\n\nIt starts very Tame, we go to visit the other part of the Country we wanted to visit at the very beginning, do some Cowboy stuff, its quiet nice. \nThen the DOME appears and thats where the action starts. The City gets attacked by Robots and People fucking Die! We see a Random Girl, completely out of place in a fancy dress looking very concerned, but we dont mind at all and Head to the Palace where Zoraal Ja gets booty wopped by his Vather because he is a traitor and kills his own people coz he is the King now of a Cyberpunk Race... That has so many problems it's ridiculous... Gulool Ja Ja didn't need to die here for the story to work, he only died, so they could take the easiest path and send Wuk Lamat on a Path of Revenge THAT MAKES NO SENSE to her character, it incredibly forced and the entire rest fo the story, would function without the extremely forced Death of Gulool Ja Ja. Zooral Ja gets his boot kicked by his father and fucking DIES! Uopsm no he gets revived, a power up! and kills his father all while we watch like Suprised Pikachu face... This is where OUR part as the MC gets ridiculous and pathetic. Zoraal Ja should have never won here, Gulool Ja Ja should have beaten his Ass even in the Power up state, to fuel His \"Rage\" let's say, more and let him retreat. \n\nBut let's go on, we find out the dome is the Headquarters of the enemies, and we go there Epicly with a Boom Rain to Boom open their gates. We get... a good Doungen, the bosses are good, except the last one, but the middle bos was actually fun (this is with most bossed in this DLC in the dungeons so, fun, somewhat challenging GREAT!)\n\n We learn that another shard and this have kinda fused together in a way, where learn of Sphene and all the other shit thats going on here. sphene is the Queen and Kinda now, because Zoraal Ja is the current King so she is literally \"useless\" the whole story and can't decide things for herself because she is Powerless. \nBut she is really nice, a gentle soul, made for us to Love and Like her! And yes, she is an interesting character and compelling. What is not compelling is how they handled her. Sphene is a tool, nothing more, to bring somewhat of a motivatio? I guess?\n\nSolution 9 is a great city and ARE SPHENES PEOPLE, they solely Focused on the part about the \"Endless\" and Wuk Lamats Revenge against Zoraal Ja, that they fumbled multiple story points so badly. Drama... is good, it makes a story interesting, but if you have: Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama, Drama. \n\nThe story loses its Point... The Last Area and last parts of the story, were only: \"OH let's get to the next Sad part! And the next and the next!\" it became so numb, I mean... what should I expect? I mean, yeah the whole last Area is just a big Sad story. But they could have done it all so much better... The second part of the story... is a Dumpster Fire of half-backed Ideas, missed principles, and stupid storywriting. They can really see, that the second part of the story, is probably where they need to get the game done and shipped finally, it feels so rushed... for the first part I needed like 3 Days to finish. The Second part is a single day, and thats where the most interesting stuff should have been...\n\n\nBut enough talking... Someone would now say: \"Ah if the story was so bad, how would you do it, huh?\"\nYeah, i know how. Done kill Gulool Ja Ja, that would bidder Zoraal Ja even more furious that he still cant beat his father after all he achieved and give a good reason why to fight Tural and wait with his invasion to prepare a proper attack where we come into play to inflate the stuff. The Resistance was a joke in the story, we saw them do NOTHING of importance, just that they exist and welp, thats it. Make is a BIG part that they IS a Resistance and regularly manipulate Zoraal Ja's invasion plans, making the initial reason why Cahciua is \"Hiding\" Make Cahciua a real Resistance Leader and with a more prominent part and... Dont make her be dead and remove that insignificant time skip that actually serves no purpose, but inflicting \"DRAMA\" because ohno... people aged inside the dome... \n\nWe kill Zoraal Ja like usual because he was so pissed and pathetic, he still got his outburst against Sphene, started to kill her peale in solution 9 and gets so beefed up on soul juice, he became a trial.

Sphene deletes herself, but here is the difference, actually not because she could bring herself to really do it but takes on this hard shell. We beat her in the fight, Wuk Lamat tries to reason with her and tells her THAT SHE STILL HAS PEOPLE IN SOLUTION 9 THAT NEED HER AND SHE APPARENTLY FORGOT ABOUT THEM. She realized she failed her Duty to her people and sustaining the endless only would have never worked anyway, because what should she do? Once she sucked up all shards in existence, her race is fucked anyway. She was just prolonging suffering. She realized she needed to be there for the people she still has and protect them, which would also technically not violate her code since she sees them as People of Alexandria as well. Have a Figurehead that now is owning up to her mistakes and stubbornness, building up the story of Tural more and the unusual union Tural is building with actually another shard that kinda fused into their country, which would make so much sense since Tural is all about peace and maintaining it and befinding others...\n\n\nEnd Result:\n\nFirst Part: 7/10\nWuk Lamat: 9/10\nOur MC Score: Holiday More\n\nSecond Part 2/10\nWuk Lamat: 3/10\nOur MC Score: Utterly useless Bafoon\n\nRemember, this is almost only a Review about the story, not the gameplay itself.

And I am hopeful that the raids, future patch MSQ trials and dungeons and so on will be similar. Would I recommend you pick the game up now as a new player simply on the promise of these things in Dawntrail? No. But there is plenty of other content in the game for a new player to enjoy, so I wouldn't shun the game on the whole. But this expansion definitely kinda sucked.\n\nThe graphics improvements are... okay. They are made less impactful by virtue of many older gear sets not getting texture upscales/not getting multiple color channels for dyes. Nevermind that the color channels for various new gear is rather wanting/questionable decisions were made about what things should or shouldn't be separately colorable.\n\nAs it pertains to the story, I am very disappointed. SE clearly missed the mark. I think that the plot would have worked better, and people would have been more accepting of it, had they buffered the story of Dawntrail in such a way that we would have had more time to get to know Wuk Lamat that felt less forced. Basically, given us a reason to want to help her, rather than forcing us to hard carry a stranger to the top so they can become a monarch on the promise of a good time.\n\nIf they had done that, and did a better job writing her character so she didn't seem so flat even after the character growth and development she did experience during this MSQ, I would have fewer complaints even with all of the front loaded lore dumping they did at the start. I have no problem riding shotgun to someone else's story after the books more or less closed on our own. But the game didn't win me over with Wuk Lamat's personality, the only thing she had going for her, and therefore it made me less motivated to slog through the quests. It does get better in the latter part of the story, but the better part feels... very forced. It almost felt like it should have been extended out over the patch quests, but I understand that would have mean't [spoiler]not being able to reveal at least two separate environments until after the end of the 7.0 questline[/spoiler] which with how the story is written at present seems unreasonable.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1719853128, "timestamp_updated": 1719853128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505066573619842529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168706856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050130907", "num_games_owned": 1251, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 229212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The world was ending and no one seems to have even had a single pot break from it. \n\nNo one is having more than petty problems unrelated to anything.\n\nYour actions meant nothing.

I finished MSQ this morning, and it's left me sitting with a lot of complicated feelings. This expansion has some of the absolute best gameplay content, duty design and set dressing, but it's absolutely hamstrung by a lifeless MSQ riddled with pacing issues and bland one dimensional characters. The spark feels like it's gone from the writing team, like they don't know what direction to go in, or worse - are afraid to take a risk.\n\nThis whole expansion could have succeeded even if the WoL wasn't there. At every moment I was shackled to Wuk Lamat, sometimes having several entries in my journal with a variation of 'Speak to Wuk Lamat again'. There was no character development for any of the scions, there was no chance for growth or any room to talk about recovering from what happened in Endwalker. Character moments (unless they involved Wuk Lamat) were few and far between, and often felt very shoehorned in. This is not an expansion where the WoL has an active role, even a secondary role - DT defenders love to talk about how 'the WoL has always been secondary!' yeah, they have, to Aymeric, to Estinien, to G'raha, to whoever, but at least we were secondary! This time, the narrative just has the WoL watch!\n\nEncounter design is fantastic, dungeons feel rewarding, and I'm excited for Arcadion Savage. Like I said, the GAMEPLAY is excellent, it's just sandwiched inbetween a mess of a main story that doesn't know what it wants to be, and I am such a FFXIV fan, I think most of the disappointment comes from seeing the brilliant potential vs the poor execution.", "timestamp_created": 1719840604, "timestamp_updated": 1728653528, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531548380851745605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168691729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047638458", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 121000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, this recommendation is solely based on the MSQ's story. The trials, dungeons, and new areas are quite fun, so if you never cared for the story, you will probably still have a great time with the expansion. Unlike a lot of people, I do not mind the slower pace or lower stakes. There are, however, three points that made me dislike this story in general.\n\nFirst, you are no longer the main character this expansion. By that I mean, that unlike in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, it doesn't feel like you're the big hero those games set you up to be, with the story instead super focused on Wuk Lamat. Moments where you would have expected your character to step forward and save the day like in the previous two expansions are instead almost totally absent or diminished by the participation of other characters. This is a big shame, because FFXIV always stood out to me compared to other MMOs due to the fact you felt like the main character in the story rather than just a passenger. This expansion takes a huge step back in that regard, and it feels as if the whole story could have happened without your character there.\n\nSecond, some cliche themes and characterization around Wuk Lamat, the main character of this expansion. Mind you, I know FFXIV always had some rather cliche themes like the power of hope and friendship, but in the previous two expansions it felt like it was addressed really well and balanced with some darker and more realistic themes. Here, though, Wuk Lamat feels like a ray of sunshine that constantly repeats the same thing about peace, and the perceived flaws she does have are overcome in ways that don't feel earned at all. She never feels challenged in her ideals, and although I don't mind the character, she is someone who I imagine most people will find grating, which won't help in others' enjoyement since she is there all the time in all the big moments.\n\nThird, retreading themes. This one is a spoiler, so I won't get too much into it, but this expansion addressed a lot of the same themes that we did in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, which feels completely unnecessary after we closed that arc. Not only that, but it also fails to be anywhere as nuanced or as good as its predecessors, and the villains simply do not measure up to what we had before.\n\nOverall, it's a big disappointment for me and a bad way to start a new arc.

The writing is horrendously bad, with awful pacing, nonsensical character motivations and an overall story which just feels pointless and tedious. Every other NPC interaction throws you into a 5-10 minute long cutscene which adds nothing to the story and only serves to cripple the pacing while the characters just reiterate what you can already see directly in front of you or you could easily intuit by yourself.\n\nLet's address the main problem people have with this expansion: Wuk Lamat. In my opinion she's not an offensively [i] bad [/i] character per se - certainly not as bad as Zero, but the fact that the entire story revolves around her character development makes the player character's role feel insignificant. What is the point of us even being here if Wuk Lamat has to do everything on her own and she's the centre of every cutscene?\n\nAbysmal story aside, there's one other major issue I have with Dawntrail, and that's the class design. Class design has been a growing concern in FFXIV for several years now, with more and more classes becoming homogenised and simplified versions of what used to make them fun. The issue isn't that the jobs have gotten worse, it's that [i] nothing has changed about them at all. [/i] I'm a tank player primarily, and we haven't had a meaningful update since Shadowbringers, leading to the role feeling incredibly stale and repetitive. I can't speak so much for other roles or jobs, but tanking in particular has sorely needed some updates for several years and has only been seemingly ignored in favour of pushing new flashy DPS jobs.\n\nOverall I'm thoroughly disappointed by Dawntrail. After the awful 6.x series I was really hoping for a fresh, exciting new expansion but what we ended up getting was a watered down, half-baked story with shallow characters, poor writing and some of the slowest, dullest pacing I've ever seen in a game.", "timestamp_created": 1719830633, "timestamp_updated": 1719830864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 201, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568952322006225586", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168680765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128248654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a camera man", "timestamp_created": 1719829703, "timestamp_updated": 1719829703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559417784214019775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168679873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311379310", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "always the same, at this point its not even worth expecting something to change within the games structure.\nlove the game but i wanna see it get better not stay and become more bland with every expansion.", "timestamp_created": 1719828690, "timestamp_updated": 1719828690, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550584197044372559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168679567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134153567", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "First off let me just talk about the positives\n-dungeons and trials were great, fun mechs and some cool armor sets to glam\n-99% of the va work is excellent, really knocked it out of the park with casting for the most part\n-zones are interesting enough, better than endwalker at the very least\n-the music was incredible as always\nand that's all i can think of off the top of my head. now for the negatives and oh boy i have a lot to say\n-ill get the worst offender out of the way first, Wuk Lamat is a terrible character. her VA is a poor choice and the work feels uninspired and off putting at times. She's so naive its nauseating, I don't know if the robots at square enix have ever attempted to try and learn how real people act, but it certainly doesn't show with her. She has a tendency to say the cringiest possible thing you could expect of her, and in turn ruins nearly every scene she's in. The expansion literally would have been better without her at all, let alone as the main character. You want me to help her, but I legit can't think of a single character i would want to help any less than her.\n-the story is uninspired and the \"twist\" at the end when you think you won but \"omg there was an even worse villain all along ahhhhhh\" was the most lazy, cop out, pad your playtime ending I've ever played in a game. Sphene's entire story is so whatever. like why should i care? you have given me no reason to care about her at all.\n-the quests are some of the most boring shit I've ever had to sit through. I have never complained about ffxiv quest design before this xpac. But the run here, talk, watch a cutscene but read an entire book during it, is so ridiculously lazy this time around its insane. tell me the story THROUGH THE GAMEPLAY, don't just make me read everything that's happening.

Far larger a part than one would expect of someone supposed to be guiding us. For example, we go to a Moblin village and begin to talk to one of them. We ask about the village, and instead of the Moblin answering, Erenville answers. Why? Could the Moblin not have given us that information from HIS village?\n\nSo the Warrior of Light goes to this new land to hopefully have a nice, casual adventure.

Most of the story that doesn't involve Wuk Lamat is pretty decent, and her character does improve a little near the end.\n\nNow for what is middling, the zones are take it or leave it, it also feels like you're done with an area way too quick and you barely have done anything in those place, also a lot of the area's are really samey until the later half.\n\nThe reason why I have to not recommend this game, the story in the first half is abysmal, this will contain some minor spoilers so don't read if you care. First, the biggest thorn in the room is Wuk Lamat, the story hinges on her being a good character and if you enjoy her the first half will be better, in fact the entire story, since she is the only character that really maters with some other new side characters, the old characters pretty much get sidelined. There is a high chance you're going to dislike her, because her only good trait is being nice and she is very quirky, it doesn't help that every other character treats her with endearment or the fact that she becomes instant best friends with the main character if you hate her, it really hurts to go through this.\n\nHowever even if you like Wuk Lamat, I believe the first part of this story is going to grate on you, most of it is like being guided around a museum about things you don't care about, they go way too indepth about lore that you yet have to care about because you're new to the place and have no investment in it, it's slow, tedious and boring. It's hard to care about cultures and history you have 0 investiment in and this is basically most of the first half of the story, told to you through droves and droves of text. The writer for the first half of the game should get fired.\n\nIn the end the story does pick up a little and becomes so-so, but it's entirely likely you won't care for it anymore because of the bad foundation and low investiment, you won't care about most things that are happening because it doesn't really affect your character or even much at all, still if you're in it like me for the combat and dungeons, it'd still recommend it, but if you are in it for the story, probably wait until they put it on a sale.\n\nFinally, I don't think the future isn't as bleak as people say, they still have good writers it shows from time to time, they really just need to fire the main writer or give him/her a smaller role. The next writer literally can just ignore everything from dawntrail and make an actual good story next time, nobody or barely anyone will miss it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1719793958, "timestamp_updated": 1719793958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539247810840606689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168649868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389264329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Lyse, perhaps i treated you too harshly!\nWuk Lame't\n\nJokes aside, this Expansion is VERY BAD, i do not recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1719793155, "timestamp_updated": 1719793554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48776400089263916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168648490", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987597969", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Wuk Lamat, eres el personaje m\u00e1s insoportable de la expansi\u00f3n.

But that's about it. For a story driven MMO and after the success and experiance which I had in ShB and EW I'm absolutely disappointed in the mess that we've got presented in this MSQ. It's such a lackluster and unfun that it made me outright bored and even angry at times. Sure we've been told that it's going to be a new beginning and a slow story, but even then it missed every single shot.\n\nFor one the main problem of the DT MSQ: Wuk Lamat.\nNot even does she feel (or basically is) like a horribly written character, the VAs also failed to do their job propperly besides in the JP version. So much even that I either turned the volume down or skipped the voiced parts as fast as I could. Adding the bland and sometimes annoying voice acting with the way she's written as a character was a pure setup for failure from  the beginning. Also the way the MSQ revolves purely around her and her quirky and clumsy behaviour only for her to then have multiple characteristic aweakenings only for acting clumsy in the next scene once again.\nOverall it feels like this MSQ and main character was written as a fanfiction for teens where the power of friendship makes one a hero over night and saves the day again and again. And it so.. SO bothers me that she ruined even the absolute last part of the story with her sudden appearance and \"friendship and love is magic :3\" attitude. But who knows, maybe it's then again the VAs fault for not delivering.\n\nIn addition that the way the story progresses makes little sense and has -so- many loose ends and feels simply rushed on so many occasions while being stretched with unneccessary fetch, follow and hide quest that even ARR looked like an action game. And even though worldbuilding for the open world was never one of XIVs strengths it feels like they've put as little work in it as they possibly could, leaving many places completly empty or putting towns which should be far apart from each other not even ten seconds in walking distances away.\nThen there is a content and item void outside of the MSQ, with reskins from older expansion being the this ones gear and nothing else really to do besides leveling up other jobs. Barely any new items, hairstyles, emotes, etc.\n\nThe only positive thing so far was the graphics update for me. Things do look better here and there and the new grass and foliage system really makes a few spots look great though. But other than that I can't really find anything else positive to say. That's it. Sadly not even the music could carry this one since everything sounds way to simmilar or doesn't at all, like electric jazz for a tribal city like Tulliolal? Huh?\n((also did the MSQ and first lvl. 100 with AST and they've butchered that one with the cards update, it hurts))\n\nOverall a 1 out of 10 Expac and it saddens me.\nI really hope Wuk Lamat doesn't show up in the 7.x patches with us and that the writing get's back on it's ShB / EW level.\nLooking forward to the planet exploration and field mission content.", "timestamp_created": 1719788145, "timestamp_updated": 1719788145, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445094496011734009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168642907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972780007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "filler expac; just as bad/pointless as stormblood", "timestamp_created": 1719785751, "timestamp_updated": 1719785751, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461776256561279297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168642589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052974531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Long AF queues coupled with unstable servers is not ok.

Coming off Endwalker, I don't believe anyone was expecting another world ending event etc, but the story presented is exceptionally poor. We've been exposed to numerous ways they could have started a new story from scratch; a new shard, an alternate reality, separating WOL from the prior cast via some sort of abduction to introduce a new one and drip feed the old cast per expansion etc, digital landscapes like OMEGA. However, we are presented to a...Mayan / Western / Cyberpunk setting for reasons...? \n\nThe first city hub is clearly where the developers really front loaded everything, it is the best location in the expansion. The music being jazz for a Mayan-esque area is odd...but it's good jazz so it's fine. Every other region is devoid of life, barren and spacious with little to no reason to ever return. The end city hub is monstrous in size, but absolutely empty. Honestly, it looks awful, the color scheme, smooth texture-less surfaces, the spread out vendors, it looks like a ghost city as there are next to no NPCs walking around or existing. The empty space is jarring from a design perspective, I find it hard that someone looked it over and approved it, but a lot of other city hubs in prior expansions suffer the same. Realistically, you'll resume AFK-ing in Limsa so what does it matter?\n\nThe entire expansion is literally walking three feet, clicking spots, waiting, turn in quest. Which is par for the course with every expansion, but it is exceptionally worse in this one, think ARR all over again. It takes hours to get into the first dungeon, and subsequent hours between the other dungeons. The WOL that effectively has killed numerous gods and saved the world countless times is now effectively back to Level-5 doing fetch quests. The out of dungeon / trial combat is incredibly sparse, much more than prior expansions. This could be summed up as a walking simulator, mixed with a VN. \n\nThe story is incredibly dry, filled with padded conversations that have no bearing on the overall narrative, which also is very uninspired and boring. It picks up slightly around level 96-97, but by that point your brain has shut off and you're more likely than not just skipping the dialogue due to how poor it is and how unlikable the new escort companion, Wuk Lamat is. \n\nYou can tell that either all the development time, I believe two years, was spent on the graphics update, (which effectively turned the Early Playstation 3 style graphics to Late Playstation 3 style graphics, not bad or unwanted, but still...), or this was a throw away story written prior or alongside Heavensward and scrapped for one reason or another. There are tons of issues with the story, but to list them all would spoil things.\n\nThe dungeons and trials, on the other hand, are pretty fun and challenging. I don't have too many complaints in that regard, and at the end of the day, that's all that matters as you'll be spamming them for dailies at the end.\n\nMechanically, there is nothing really new, no overhaul or different way to play / interact with the game, just more of the same which isn't \"bad\", but after so long some innovation might be nice. Endwalker brought in new players who had never played the game at all, this expansion seems to be pushing out the existing players the further they get into the expansion.

Ever since the StormBlood class reworks every expansion has homogenized, simplified and streamlined classes more and more. Tanks and healers have it the worst. Every healer plays basically the same, every tank plays almost exactly the same. They have the same defensive cooldowns, the same damage abilities. It's just unbelievably boring. The bi-annual astro and monk reworks also make another return to no avail. Square still has no clue what to do with these jobs and Monk has been dumbed down even more to a simple 1-2-3 class.\n\nEvery expansion the only new thing added is another high potency 30/60sec cooldown to press. It's unbelievably boring. If next expansion they dont step away from this formula this game is doomed. I've been playing the exact same jobs with nearly no gameplay or rotational changes for 4 years now, and it's going to be another 2 years of the exact same thing from the looks of it. \n\nThe main story is also a joke, it's poorly paced, the first 70% of the story is an extremely boring tournament arc/ coming of age story of Wuk Lamat's coming of age story but is incredibly uninteresting. I don't want to post any spoilers but what happens with the \"gate\" and the Zoraal Ja makes absolutely 0 sense. \n\nThe graphical and engine update is absolutely amazing though.

Just gathered these 5 flowers? nice, how about you go talk to these 5 people that you don't care about & will never see again :) After that, go walk to the other side of the map to talk to 3 more people :))\n\nVoice acting is subpar, especially for the supposed main character of the Dawntrail story. Trying to traverse the new maps is like trying to find your way through the Himalayan fucking mountains, and places where you think you can jump off of (and be at your target location way faster), you face invisible walls, well fuck you then square! Some maps have bad aetheryte placements as well, forcing you to walk from one side of the map to the other and sometimes all the way back again BECAUSE THERE IS NO AETHERYTE NEAR THE QUEST!!\n\nJobs (especially healers) have been so homogenized in Dawntrail that there is literally no difference between them anymore. Healer level ups literally have not had any impact on your gameplay on healer since Shadowbringers. Every level up is just 'Skill X gains one more charge', 'Skill Y gains 20 potency', 'Duration of Skill Z's effect is increased by 5 seconds'. Classes like Astrologian and Monk have been reworked so many times that they've completely lost the identity they once had, and square STILL DOESNT KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO WITH THEM. In Stormblood, Astrologian had different effects for each of their cards. They could augment the effects of their cards, due to their RNG mechanics every pull felt different, there was risk vs reward. Monk had the identity of having different rotations it could follow; it wasn't bound to a single flow, it could adapt to fights easily. Now it's just a reskin of every other 1-2-3 combo class in the game. It's lost it's identity.\n\n The gameplay pressure that the game once exerted at a good level (Shadowbringers/maybe Endwalker) has been watered down so much that you can just alt tab every GCD and be completely fine, missing 0 damage on the boss. Just delete half the classes at this point because obviously you can't introduce any form of innovation anymore. After being a diehard Astrologian main for 6 fucking years, I can't take it anymore.

It made me remember how horrible the story of Dawntrail was, something I was actually in the process of forgetting due to how fun the fight was, and solidified this as the first horrible expansion for this game. Boss fights were otherwise decent, all trials were good, dungeons are horrible overall due to what feels like even more forced single pulls against hp sponges without mechanics than usual.\n\nClasses continue to be universally pushed towards the same level of boring instead of adding some variety in difficulty between the classes for people who enjoy different things: Just let some classes be super simple and let some have some funky optimizations to do for those that want to. Let some classes have low APM and some classes have high APM. If this causes \"unfixable\" balance issues: stop backloading fights and throw in a soft enrage at the end or something.\n\nSomeone thought it was a good idea to remove the damage from the two higher APM tanks' gap closers without letting the role who is supposed to protect others at least target their allies with them to compensate. Also since they don't generate enmity now things feel weird as you jump to an enemy and it runs off to punch someone else unless you manually hit it with a different ability too.\n\nOverall the other system updates all fall short too:\nNew dye channel doesn't let you choose if your black and blue dress should be white and gold but rather if it should be white and then have a tiny gold button you can't see. This seems to apply to like half the gear with the second channel. \nTwo new classes ([strike] of which the one I've tried at least seems kinda fun, if super simple. [/strike] EDIT: They have now announced they're dumbing it down.) but no new glamour plates so you can't have a unique glamour per combat class anymore.\n\"Movement from wind will appear more consistent at high frame rates.\" but Movement Physics are still tied to framerate so hair/ears/clothes etc are still super stiff or even immobile as you go above 60fps.\nNew AO option is excessive and has weird haloing around some objects\nThings are weirdly blurry at times, even when turning off raidal blur. Probably due to the new AA setting (that at least fixes flickering in foliage and stuff) but it seems excessive. Personally think it looks better if turning the 3d render resolution with FSR to 99% so its sharpening filter turns on.\nDLSS doesn't seem to have any quality/performance/auto etc options so it'll turn the game from 1440p to 144p if it feels like it.\nGraphics update is hit and miss: some hairs' color is weirdly different from the color of Viera ears making those hairstyles look very strange. Some faces still give of quite different vibes from before the update even after the second benchmark's fixes.

It was an easy bar to reach, and square barely managed that with how the NPCs are constantly reminding eachother and myself about how strong I am. And so far all I've done is walk around, and watch other people do things! \n\nEven the bad guys aren't really bad guys, they're just friends we haven't made yet. It's so lame. Any hint of combat is quickly squashed with yet another cut scene and maybe a quest where you go pick grass or some nonsense.

I went in very excited for a multidimensional character with strengths and flaws and secrets. But instead we just get a cat-shaped nuisance with the emotional intelligence and charisma of a wet bag. And we just have to follow this person around while they go do things, or wait around for them to come back from doing things without us. \n\nI'm still holding out hope that it gets better, and if it does, I'll update my review.

Wuk Lamat is probably the most annoying, tedious, and op character I've ever seen. Lymle from Star Ocean is a less annoying character. The story is uninspired, and at some points it doesn't seem like they know what they want to do with it? \n\nIf you still wanna play all the other Dawntrail content, skip the cutscenes and just read a summary. You'll suffer less. \n\nAlso, the fucking walking. It seems like they knew they didn't have enough content, and decided to remove some aetherytes to drag it out longer. At least Garlemald was flat and you could autorun the map, the new area have a lot of vertical points, so be prepared to not use autorun. The most painful filler I've seen. You could probably make some Gil flying someone around tbh.\n\nSome of the class changes are heartbreaking. I've been an AST main since stormblood, and this expac I dropped it after attempting to play in one dungeon. The changes are absolutely awful. I know this isn't just an SE thing, as lots of game companies have been doing this, but dumbing down classes is absolutely stupid: why are these companies catering to the most lazy of players? The ones who don't want to try to put even a token amount of effort in? These players aren't the ones sticking around and playing the content. The AST changes nearly made me quit the game - I was so heartbroken by the absolute gutting of the card system. \n\nThe post MSQ dungeons, extremes, and new raid tier are pretty great though. They have a bit of challenge, so we all know that means its going to get nerfed after the lazy ones complain its too much effort to learn - so get in there while you can. \n\nI have really high hopes for the new tier.

This might be competing with Stormblood for the worst FFXIV expansion so far.\n\nI've been playing since 1.0 beta and the only other time I've felt this ammount of tedium coming from the main scenario quests is when 2.0, A Realm Reborn was still a thing. Even now its a sludge to progress through it and regrettably, it feels like this expansion is following its misguided vision.\n\nTo elaborate a bit: The new zones are amazing and I love them, specially since I'm mexican myself, but the questing and pacing of the msq (main scenario) is a pain in the ass. Not only is there very little combat at first but there is a shit ton of dialogue and cutscenes that feel like chaff. Nothing interesting is really showcased except some of the rather plain personalities of the princes and how immature Wuk Lamat is... If you ever felt that G'raha Tia and Krile have gone through some sort of retardation and went from being cool characters (such as being the Crystal Exarch) to dumb toddlers, well... I have a nasty surprise for you... The new character suffers from the same crap treatment and is probably the worst of them all.\n\nIts a shame because the new areas clearly have a lot of work to them and there are some little details that are really cool but the msq is such a boring endeavour that, for someone who never skips cutscenes, I'm always wondering if it wasn't jsut better to skip and be done with it... And don't get me started on one of the villains' logic: \"We should wage war to teach our people the horrors of war itself, that way they wont want conflict anymore...\" Truly a genius, this guy, who wrote the character profile.\n\nThe new jobs are kinda great but nothing to write home about. Maybe Viper is the best of the two of them, in my opinion, but again, just like in Stormblood, the release of 2 DPS jobs brings chaos to the daily roulette system. Unless you have friends who are willing to play the much sought after healers or tanks, you can spend a lot of time waiting for a queue to pop and do your dungeons and roulettes.\n\nAlso a big fuck you to SE for showcasing \"tacos\" as some sort of TacoBell TexMex bullshit.

Shifting the story focus away from WoL to instead focus on an annoying and pathetic character that follows an incredibly overplayed underdog trope (Wuk Lamat), while also trying to build a new story ark, was a horribly poor decision on SE's part. The dungeons and trials are great, and the graphical and technical changes are nice as well.\n\n\nHaving now finished the expansion, I am thoroughly unimpressed. While the story had a few high points sprinkled throughout, they were far too sparse to make up for the otherwise lackluster experience. I commend the development team on the duties, near all of which were quite interesting, challenging, and enjoyable, as well as many of the system and technical changes. The graphics overhaul is proceeding beautifully, and I'm excited to see the later improvements that come with this.\n\nI hope that moving forward the story shifts away from Wuk Lamat and on to more interesting things where the WoL plays a more significant role, rather than babysitting an immature and incompetent brat. I also hope that rather than simplifying things to the lowest common denominator like they have been, the team will instead require that actual skill be necessary to be exemplary at each job. If that makes people upset, all I can say is too bad and get good.\n\n\n-- Update 2 --\n\nApproaching the end. If the first half of the expansion was 2/10, the second half is maybe 5/10. There have certainly been some more interesting and engaging parts, however the main character is still primarily the boring and bland Wuk Lamat for much of it.\n\nThe dungeons and trials here have been for the most part great as well. They've really done a good job here!\n\n\n-- Update 1 --\n\nNearing half way through, there have been a few brief parts of the story that were enjoyable, nearly all of which have been when Wuk Lamat was not present. Still plenty of dull moments where I find myself drawn to skip cutscenes and dialogue as I simply cannot be arsed to care about Wuk Lamat or that which revolves around her.\n\nThe dungeons and trial so far have been fantastic. Far more challenging and enjoyable than previous expansions!\n\n\n-- Original --\n\nAs much as I love FFXIV, this expansion really is missing the mark.\n\nAfter a few hours of playing, I've been met by a storm of cutscenes, lengthy dialogue, and fetch quests. The primary NPC, 'Wuk Lamat' is boring, uninteresting, and follows an overplayed and bland underdog trope. I find myself wishing I could be participating with one of the far more interesting and unique competitors than her.\n\nI understand that as Endwalker brought the closure of nearly a decade of story and world building, that now we must begin a new cycle, so there's going to be a lot of information being thrown at you, but I wish it was more engaging than it has been so far. This feels more like doing chores than a game. ARR felt more enjoyable than this, even the second or third time through...\n\nAs it stands I am but a fraction of the way through the expansion, and I hope that it gets better further in, I will update this review as I approach its end.", "timestamp_created": 1719709266, "timestamp_updated": 1720303153, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452783018350601196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168544318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113092827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuk Lamat", "timestamp_created": 1719707944, "timestamp_updated": 1719757742, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168543019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880289226", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "after playing some time with dawntrail; im finding the story really boring and none of the characters interesting, which is really weird knowing i had enjoyed all of the other expansions from ff14\nmaybe i'll try it out again once the patches come out but i have no idea at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1719706407, "timestamp_updated": 1719750467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501812517642974854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168542835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076764120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "4/6 new zones are filler and wuk lamat exists. \n\nHopefully savage tier and eden ultimate can salvage\n\nNews sources say the local trash dump is filled to the brim with BLM and MNK jobstones.\n\nEDIT: 8/24/2024: new savage tier did not in fact salvage this expansion.

It also gets into the origins of the lizard people's practice of eugenics, the reason? They are incapable of figuring out farming, that's why they sacrifice thousands of kids for their search of the supreme supersoldier. \n\nDuring this time one of my friends finished the expansion and told me \"It only gets worse\" before cancelling the subscription and uninstalling the game. At this time I thought he was being over dramatic, because sure, it was bad, but it wasn't THAT bad... yet.\n\nWhen you get to the second half of the story it does get better for a while, Wuk Lamat matures and is no longer the butt of the joke, and it even presents mildly interesting topics that will catch your attention, not because it is good, but because it is better than what you experienced before.\n\nBy the time you get to the level 99 MSQ quests the writers decide they want to see the world burn, throwing out of the window the values that FFXIV has been adopting for over a decade, things like hope, never giving up and searching for solutions that try to maximize the wellbeing of as many people as possible. \n\nThe writers decided to pull a 180\u00ba while trying to copy the same message Shadowbringers tried to send us, about how the Ascians need to let go, that their time passed and they need to accept it, that the Source and Reflections have their own right to exist. However, their new version of the Ascians (Endless) and Amauroth (Alexandria) tries to do the same as Shadowbringers and Endwalker did... culminating a decade long story, but in six (6) hours instead.\n\nNot only they managed to spit on the fans of FFIX with extremely poor fan service, they did it while forcing you (the WoL!) to commit genocide against the people of another reflection, the writers only had six (6) hours to try to make you feel bad about committing genocide using cheap tactics like very bland emotional manipulation: What if you get to know this people before you murder them? See? They are people just like you!\n\nDoesn't really work and I have to admit it was extremely upsetting to see how the writers were forcing me into perpetrating genocide as \"it is the only option!\" in a game that has been pushing values and principles like being hopeful and finding ways to co-exist with others. There is no attempt to co-exist with anyone, there is no attempt to look for alternatives, there is nothing, you are going to commit genocide and you are going to enjoy it.\n\nThe moment the happy music kicks in as soon as the credits start to roll was insulting, no one, not a single character bothers to mention what happened, no one cares, no one shows any kind of emotion, it just happens, congratulations, you won and nothing happened here! Not to mention how tone deaf the characters are during this last six hours of the story, not only tone deaf but outright offensive, only Erenville showing any kind of human emotion while the rest of the cast treats this as a regular Monday.\n\nUltimately, I REALLY wish the expansion was about a vacation, a REAL vacation, you are lured in with the promise of adventure and relaxation after over a decade of over the top constant apocalypses threatening the Source. Instead what you find is a MSQ about how you are forced into manipulating the elections to the throne of South America by \"cultivating\" a suitable ruler AND committing genocide in the last six (6) hours of the expansion without ANY kind of depth, commentary or emotion. \n\nCongratulations, you \"cultivated\" a suitable ruler to the throne of South America and eradicated the entire population of another Reflections, here is your orchestrion roll with the song \"Smile\".\n\nI can't express how as a writer this MSQ makes me feel because Steam is rated e for everyone, so I will just say that I HOPE this MSQ was written by Chat GPT because the Cryptobro CEO of Square Enix fired all writers, because if a group of human beings are responsible for the writing of this expansion, I'm out, there is no way someone read the script and said this was okay, not only because of the poor dialogue, the illusion of choice, the false premise of a vacation, but because this is downright the most offensively bad writing I have seen in a videogame, it puts Dragon Age 2, FFXV and Emil Pagliarulo to SHAME.\n\nMaybe I have been spoiled by games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Arknights among many other extremely well written videogames that masterfully touch all kind of themes, tragedies and hopes for a brighter future.\n\nPeople who believe Dawntrail to be a good story really need to read more and demand better stories from Square Enix, because better stories are better for everyone playing the game, not only for the people who doesn't care or don't even know what they are playing.\n\nDawntrail is the last nail in the coffin for me, I don't believe Square Enix as a developer is capable of making a good game, let alone art. \n\nI was looking forward to Dawntrail, a new beginning, a fresh experience, a future for the MMO I fell in love with during Heavensward and lost all interest for by the end of Stormblood.\n\nWe got the most offensively, violently bad writing the XIV team has ever delivered. The classes remain the same as they were in Endwalker, we are going for another two years with the exact same classes we have been playing with for the last three years. The music is completely forgettable, it is not good. The dungeons were somewhat interesting and some new mechanics are great, but they are overshadowed by a new design philosophy that forces you to get hit by them first before you can learn them. The new maps are big, some of them are beautiful, and some are a huge wasted opportunity (Alexandria).\n\nAt the end, this is the most disappointed I have ever been in FFXIV and the only option given to me by the devs and the community is just to not care, because no one cares, the devs don't care about their own game, and the community doesn't care about what they get from the devs. \n\nSo why continue playing? Why look forward to Savage? Why look forward to anything story related? The devs don't care about the game they are working on, the community doesn't care about the quality of the game they play, you will be shut down the moment you suggest they deserve better. \n\nI postponed Elden Ring's DLC for far too long now, it is time to move on.

It's an improvement over shadowbringers and endwalker! Which means it's still steaming dogshit. Still the same formulaic timelined dances everywhere with no unique takes on the formula, you just stand in the right place at the right time while pressing 1 2 3.\n\nThe job design? I didn't think it could get worse than endwalker but they did it! The two minute meta that killed every last part of any job's uniqueness is back with a vengeance, ruining your damage profile so that they can cram in a hundred flashy finisher moves in to your two minute burst window.\n\nThe world and areas? Visually, they're quite pleasant. Shaaloani, Yak T'el, and Urqopacha are brilliant, while Heritage Found and Kozama'uka are still pretty decent. Let's not talk about the last zone, it was terrible.

The writing took a serious hit. Long gone were the stakes, everyone just lived because of the power of friendship. The literal world ending scenario was there and gone again in a matter of cutscenes and there was little to no lasting effect on the populace at large. The blue feeling twitter bird big bad was just terribly executed and the writing took a nosedive.\n\nThere was also the SEVERE lack of content in EW - the last 8 or 9 months saw very little to nothing being added, EW also brought with it the most EGREGIOUS homogenisation of classes we had ever seen and made the gameplay a snoozefest outside of Ultimate encounters. The quality of the raids also took a serious hit in the methodology and overall world-building that went into them.\n\nAs a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series and an avid player of FFXIV, I couldn't be more disappointed with the newest expansion, Dawntrail. This supposed epic journey into new realms has turned out to be nothing short of a tedious slog through uninspired writing and lackluster characters.\n\nLet's start with Wuk Lamat, perhaps the most irritating character ever conceived in the Final Fantasy universe. From the moment this cringe-worthy NPC graced my screen, I was subjected to incessant chatter that served no purpose other than to grate on my nerves. Wuk Lamat seems to exist solely to annoy players with repetitive dialogue and a personality that makes Jar Jar Binks look like a paragon of depth and sophistication.\n\nAnd speaking of depth, or rather the lack thereof, let's talk about the main character's journey in Dawntrail. It's astonishing how little there is to care about. The narrative lacks any compelling twists or emotional resonance. Instead, it unfolds predictably, as if ticking off boxes on a checklist of RPG clich\u00e9s. The supposed \"emotional moments\" fall flat, leaving me more indifferent than invested.\n\nThe writing in Dawntrail is where the true disappointment lies. It's as if the writers took a collection of generic fantasy tropes, threw them into a blender, and poured out a lukewarm sludge of clich\u00e9s. Dialogue feels forced and unnatural, characters lack depth or development, and the overarching plot fails to inspire any sense of wonder or excitement.\n\nIt's not just me that feels this way either. Across the internet, other players echo similar sentiments. One review aptly describes Dawntrail as \"a soulless addition to an otherwise beloved franchise,\" while another critic laments, \"I've never been so uninterested in the fate of an in-game world.\"\n\nIt is a monumental letdown. From the grating presence of Wuk Lamat to the shallow narrative and uninspired writing, this expansion fails to capture the essence of what makes Final Fantasy great. Longtime fans deserve better, and newcomers will find little reason to stay. Save your gil and your time for a journey more deserving of your investment.\n", "timestamp_created": 1719681002, "timestamp_updated": 1719681002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393218159675598145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168513593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990058469", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 145788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "with almost 2500 hours in Final Fantasy XIV I just cannot recommend this expansion in it's current state. the Main Story Line Quest is painfully boring.

FIrst of all, MSQ really was exceptionally weak this time, but for me the problems seem to be opposite from most people. I really don't give a shit about Wuk Lamat being shoved into my face every cutscene and having her regurgitate things that should've left up to to make conclusions about (Even Stormblood got this part right, there was no moralizing and telling me what I should be thinking even on heavier topics such as how the hell Doman Culture managed to create people like Yotsuyu even at times of peace, or having some character TELL ME how I should be feeling about things). For me, Wuk Lamat was more of a symptom of a disease that the writing had, rather than disease itself. If anything, I think if they kept her personality the same, but toned down on the screentime they were giving her, stopped her from taking spotlight from every other new character introduced and even the Scions and have her repeat everything we've done in dialogue, she would be OK in my opinion. \nMy biggest gripe with the story is that I would genuinely enjoy it if whole of it was like the first half. Give me adventures in new continent, let me explore things and experience new cultures, hell, I would've had a blast if I was doing what Estinien was doing - killing things and eating sabotenders. But instead, halfway through, I got thrown into a shitstorm that made absolutely zero sense, and as much as I enjoyed the zones and aesthetics, I was left sick from the tonal shift and another realm endangering bullshit rather than having a single chill expansion where WoL could have adventures and experience new things together with his fellow boomer Scions, like my boys Estinien, Urianger and Thancred. To make it worse, none of it made any sense whatsoever, the second half plot was absolute bullshit, that I couldn't even digest even with suspension of disbelief. The antagonist for the first half has proven himself to be extremely competent and could've been absolutely amazing, and with his competence he could've achieved so much more and be an absolutely compelling character. Instead, he suddenly turned into an idiot with YEARS of prep time, he didn't even feel like the same character anymore. Then the whole business about the people in the new zones, it once again lacked any kind of sense, which unfortunately I can't talk about without going into full blown spoiler territory, and any kind of \"moral dillema\" it had is actually not a dilemma whatsoever if you dedicate even a moment to think about it with philosophy beyond that of a middle schooler. The only silver lining about story is that it introduced quite a few characters I liked a lot, such as Wuk Evu and Cahciua. I also think certain princess that makes an appearance later is hollow and I felt zero sympathy towards her, honestly I have no idea why people like her and why some people even dare to imply that second half is when it gets better when for me second half is what pissed me off the most about the story.\n\nI am ALMOST tempted to give this expansion a positive review, because I really enjoyed the hell out of new zones, dungeons, and HONEY B. LOVELY (I am a good little worker bee) almost made me give a positive review single-handedly, but in the end I'm leaving negative review because I am absolute pissed about Squeenix, their incompetence, and their tired old excuses. A third world modder in his basement does more than squeenix on daily basis. I get it that the engine and spaghetti code is an old amalgamation, but you can't possibly tell me that multi million dollar company can't hire a few people to figure out a way for us to have essential things like GLAMOUR LOG instead of this garbage archaic glamour system we have now where we have to keep physical copies of items and the amount of them we can store into our glam dresser being extremely limited if you play more than a few jobs.

I have no issues with those.\nGlamour options are the usual reskins with a few awesome new ones included.\nMap design is great even if the first two & the first city are uninspired.\n\n\n90-94 is essentially a collection of irrelevant side quests masquerading as main story content.\nI was personally bored to tears doing these quests but I found a coping mechanism a few hours in. I loaded up Stargate & binge watched it whilst essentially ignoring the cutscenes & text. That is something I never would have dreamt of, even back in ARR. The quests were just that dull & honestly, if I wanted to be bored doing repetitive tasks I'd just go to work & get paid.\n\nIn my opinion 90-94 can safely be skipped without missing any story at all and if you're on the EN dub I would actually recommend you doing so.\nIf you enjoyed the pre-nerf cheese quest at lv30 in ARR then you'd enjoy this.\n\n\n94-97 is Good. This however is locked behind 10h of previous content so if you value your time more than I value mine you might just not bother getting to this point.\n\n\n97+ is Very Good. The zone designs, fights & enemies here are fantastic & are clearly designed by a team exceptionally competent at their job. If you're a gpose addict then this is the place in the story you will need to reach.\n\n\nNow, the controversial part.\nWuk Lamat is just a bad character. She is a poorly written Mary-Sue who showed up out of nowhere in the last Endwalker patch, pushing two good potential new characters to the sidelines & removing the potential for the expansion to be about them.\n\nThis expansion is entirely based around Lamat & your character probably has less written lines of dialogue options than this paragraph.\nI've seen a few reviews mocking people for saying this expansion is about Wuk Lamat but if I wanted to sit back and do nothing for hours on end without any involvement from me I'd just go and re-watch Lord of the Rings. Player involvement is what sets a video game apart from other media & Dawntrail fails to realize this.\nIt's okay to have the player character take on a more passive role but that doesn't mean we sit on our hands whilst following her around. It means we take a different route to the usual & perhaps organise the evacuation or protect a supply chain instead of fighting this expansions big bad guy.\n\nLamat's VA appears to have no vocal training whatsoever. This just isn't the kind of voice acting we've come to expect from this game since A Realm Reborn & quite frankly it's incredibly jarring to hear Krile or Erenville put on a fantastic performance only to be followed up by what sounds like some complete amateur they found in the bushes outside their office.\nI had to swap to JP voice acting for this expansion which is a shame as I've loved the previous EN voice actors but it was so immersion breaking that it just made sense to do so.\n\n\nThis review will remain negative until the positive story content outweighs the negative in further patches.\n\n\nTl;dr\ncat hate\ndungeons r cool\nYou're probably still going to buy this anyway if you're a FF player.", "timestamp_created": 1719663452, "timestamp_updated": 1719966816, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534678876399993896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168490060", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999992331", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "burn the furry and roll back playermodel changes", "timestamp_created": 1719663407, "timestamp_updated": 1719663407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.323609322309494019", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168488958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139228248", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Very bad MSQ, it feels like ARR all over again...\nEdit: It's way worse than ARR, at least ARR didn't have Wuk Lamat", "timestamp_created": 1719662490, "timestamp_updated": 1719860730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488543242216110229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168488428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010606834", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible story with boring, bland writing, nonsensical character motivations (WHY are we agreeing to help an absolute rando win the throne of a country we know nothing about), MSQ is a barren wasteland of fetch quests akin to ARR.

The first few hours drag on with barely any combat. And while the main city is visually stunning, its sprawling map and verticality becomes annoying to navigate. Support jobs feel homogeneous and uninspired. I was excited for Viper, but even it falls flat for me personally.\n\nTo give credit where it's due, the dungeon and solo duty mechanics were fun.

I have finished the MSQ and just been collecting gear since. I'll keep this to the points on why this expansion is just a full blown PTSD flashback of ARR (which is well known as the worst part of FFXIV, granted that was when they were learning what to do. There's no excuse, it's been many, many, years since then.)\n\n* This is not \"It's a new place, WOL is on vacation! People are just mad there's no world ending threat.\" Once you play the story you realize this isn't the case. It's simply such a slow, boring, plot that you >hope< that's what's going on.\n* You spend your first few hours looking at frogs, picking plants, and playing a minigame where you look at some rocks and then confirm that yes, that boat.... is in fact a boat. Yep, that sure is an Alpaca. Etc.\n* You spend several, several, hours simply doing fetch quests. It's boring. In fact you do it through the entire expansion.\n* The entire \"storyline\" if you can call it that, is very predictable as soon as you meet the characters in the first 2 hours of playing.\n* You are shoehorned into being unimportant - Your character, who you pay a subscription to play, is made to feel unimportant and act as a side character. You're made to feel unimportant.\n* The main city design is horrid. It's so frustratingly painful to navigate that I gave up on even exploring it. It's just stairs.\n* The NPC (Wuk) they want you to care about is insufferable. When you meet them they are \"ha ha silly personality\" and it becomes \"Hey, Champion, babysit her.\" She goes from being unable to deal with very basic situations to stealing every single moment in the spotlight from you, the WoL, after you do absolutely all of the work. In fact at the end of the MSQ you go through ALL of this trouble as the WoL to set everything right and she literally bursts in and steals all the credit. And we're supposed to enjoy her? Okay. \n* Wuk is literally shoved in your face at every single turn. You become the B team, and all of your favorite companions that you have grown to love over the years are put into a C team position. It's like being tied down, force fed, and being told \"enjoy this food.\" The fact they simply shove you to the side and force this character in your face trying to DEMAND you enjoy them and bond with them actually makes people despise her. On Twitter you'll see people talking about how they enjoy her. In game? Here on steam? Forums? She's universally disliked. They really dropped the ball on how to introduce a new character.\n* Some people complain the Voice Actress who did the English voice for Wuk is bad, I think they did >okay<. Not amazing, not bad. But the character is so poorly written and forced onto you that you just don't care. \n* The zones are very mid. \n* The dialog is very poorly written. At one point there's a cutscene where someone says \"There's a time to fight and a time to withdraw. That time for you is now.\" And while I understand what they MEANT....okay. Which time is now? You encounter things like this quite often.\n* Events feel very disorganized. \n* You, the savior of the star. The ender of calamities. Slayer of various gods.....are demoted to a babysitter. You're actually a babysitter. \n* The \"visual upgrade\" is much worse than anything you can \"alter\" yourself. Definitely not mindblowing or exciting.\n\nGood stuff?\n- SE Music team has never failed us. Several of the fight OSTs are absolutely on my listen to list daily.\n- The Trial fights are actually fun, with the last one being kind of bonkers.\n- The Dungeons are pretty decent, even if they went with a \"Boss attacks, does 1 big AOE, does 2 mechanics, repeats\" style.\n- Some of the new gear is absolutely awesome looking.\n- You can seriously skip every single dialog option and cutscene and still understand what's going on.\n\nTL;DR - Overall, this expansion doesn't warrant being $40. It's $19.99 at best. It doesn't even feel like an expansion. It feels like an MSQ patch. There's 100 quests and they're all abysmal and boring. They should have made this entire thing a Post-Endwalker update and worked on something else.\n\n\"Talk to Wuk\"\n\"Look at this boat\"\n\"Find this rock\"\n\"Fetch Quest\"\n\"Fetch Quest\"\n\"Fetch Quest\"\n\"Watch 7 long cutscenes that are absolutely unimportant between each quest\"\n\nAnd that's the entire, ENTIRE, expansion.", "timestamp_created": 1719650214, "timestamp_updated": 1719901122, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168476000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216690097", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay so this was pretty ranty, so I'll summarise it (rants at the bottom)\n\nI'm about 40 - 50 quests at time of revision (rant was about ~30).\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nSo the new dungeons and raids are legitimately fun. Up to the third and they are pretty much the only thing getting me through MSQ. While some of the class changes are.. whatever I'm sure this is where most of the fun will come from.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nSucks. It is decent at the 40-ish mark where I'm at, but everything before feels like filler. The lack of being able to hear / read dialouge when going from a to B means you need to have these constant pit stops where the characters say the most mundane things.\n\nAlso the story kinda forgets you exist? Given our feats why do we just stand by and do nothing half the time? Literally just watch as preventable things happen? I've gone back top my ARR head-cannon where my character is just propping out a cardboard cut out during these events, and is really just fishing nearby.\n\nI feel like at least three hours has been cut-scenes that are just observations about point B or the trip there \"Wow is that an X, what a lovely shade of blue!\"  *Characters slowly emote and look at each other for 40s before camera cinematically fades up*.\n\nAnother downside is the [spoiler] Succesion contest [/spoiler] (Spoiler for the quest right before Dawntrail I guess?). We aren't exactly there to explore, we have a task that needs to be completed. We are supposed to adventure and explore but are forced [spoiler] to participate in essentially The Greatest Race [/spoiler]. Kinda feels like we were lied to.\n\n\n\n[h2] Environment [/h2]\nBig, kinda interesting and cool. But the scale serves 0 purpose other then to make travelling back and forth unbearable. I just had to auto run for 4 minutes strait (no riding map) To get to a quest marker... again. You have to do this 4 min walk of (basically) silence twice in the same zone (hell within ~5 quests in between) because the map is so large for no reason and convenient aetherite scary I guess.\n\nFinding the fishing spots is fun! Aether currents less so but it gives you an actual excuse to see half the zones. \n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nIt's frustrating because I kinda want to change to a recommend, I know I will enjoy gearing and doing high level content, but the slog of the MSQ is so dissapointing. It feels like that had to reach a certian run time so padded it out to 100 quests, when the first 30-ish quests could have been over in 10.\n\nIf your in it for the end game and gameplay you will probably enjoy this, but you will need to slog through a story that waits ~10 hours before being \"decent\". \n\n\n[h2] Rant [/h2]\n\n[strike]\nI get not raising stakes even further, especially after last expansion. \nBut The story starts off really Meh. and it looks like they went bigger (but barren) = better.\n\nGiven who we are, being sidelined and having to take crap from characters we can stomp (and if we can't then that's just power scaling BS ) is grating. If any of the antagonists are supposed to be intimidating, uh they're not. I was kinda hoping for like, political intrigue and being torn between who to back etc etc.~~\n\n Unfortunately it's just a lot of shonen anime weak protagonist crap with 2D villains, where we only ever hear about how cool people / things are and it's assumed we want to help and will always root for the protagonist, despite no real leg work being done to make them likeable / explain why the hell I'm okay being dragged around on their \"adventure\", doing boring busy-work.\n\nThe best part (story wise) is probably the first dungeon, it is the first engaging thing in the expansion and kinda has \"Wacky Races\" vibes which is cute and adventure-y. \n\nWhen they said getting back to our roots as adventurers I was expecting more new undiscovered places and... IDK exploring? Not 3 hours of fetch quests / go here quests then a kinda fun dungeon.\n\n\nAll of this is amplified by the lack of walk and talk. Walk to point A BLABLHABLAHBLAH walk to point B, BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH, Crawl half way across a map in silence to point C BLABLABLAH... you ghet the picture. So much time is spent in silent transit, then dialouge dump then silent transit. A lot of the (lets be real padding dialoufge) could probs be played while moving but that requires A). voice acting or B). smarter auto walk that avoids mobs and goes from a to b while I read text.\n\nSuper upsetting that, if I wasn't with friends and looking forward to raids etc. I probably would've dropped this expansion already. Seems some people think this is just a filler ark so we shouldn't expect anything... like that's a good thing?\n\nI'll change this if it gets good enough to warrant such a meh start, but the whole mindset of oh it gets good eventually so put up with being bored for several hours.... not a fan.\n[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1719650043, "timestamp_updated": 1719823698, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502854466438293457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168475857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040860130", "num_games_owned": 2165, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "During Endwalker there were only 4 tank, 4 healers but had 12 DPS, somehow they think it's a good idea to add 2 more dps making this the second expansion to only have new dps, this makes the dps queue almost unplayable.

We already had this damn story element in the other expansions. And let's not forget about the voice acting, not great. Change it to JP for something a bit more tollerable.\n\nThe story itself is slower paced, which isn't bad by itself, but the writing has to back it up, which it just doesn't. It stuff we have already seen before in other expansions.

But it's very often a case of the good parts being good enough to overshadow the bad parts and the tedium of FFXIV's \"Go to place, talk to NPC, pick up item, give item to NPC, watch 5m long unvoiced cutscene, talk to next NPC\" storytelling. It's a very fine line FFXIV has generally managed to stay on the good side of... until now\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here, too much for this review to not end up as an essay. I'll try keep it short. Wuk Lamat is a brand new character who has clearly ended up rubbing a lot of people the wrong way with how she is characterised in Dawntrail. The issue is the writers have gone all in on her, making her essentially the main character AND main focus of the story. Our story is meant to be 'low stakes' but this ends up as the level 90-96 story mostly consisting of performing menial chores for the sake of Wuk Lamat. \nAt least one could praise it for having the courage to be a low stakes story after Endwalker... except then the level 97-100 story happens. If anyone tells you Dawntrail is 'low stakes', you can safely assume they have not actually finished the story. Some people might prefer this leap back to high stakes - to me it's just the writers committing to a bit for 2/3 of the expansion then chickening out at the last moment because they don't have faith in themselves to write an ending that doesn't involve saving the world. \n\nAs admitted by the developers themselves, job design is not the focus on this expansion. If you have played Shadowbringers or Endwalker, you have essentially played the Dawntrail version of the jobs already. \n\nSo all we have left is the raiding. And after finishing both EX trials, I can safely say.... it's good? They both demonstrate a level of creativity that I found completely lacking in Endwalker's fight design. If the savage raid design is of the same quality as the EX design, I might be able to say \"Dawntrail is a good expansion for raiders\". \n\nBut raiders are still a minority of the players, and raiders will still have to go through the story. Is it worth paying full price to play through what I feel is by far the worst writing in FFXIV? No. Is it worth skipping through it to get to the endgame? Maybe if the raids are good enough. They're going to have to be good enough, because this time around \"the story is good\" is no longer something FFXIV can rely on.", "timestamp_created": 1719636910, "timestamp_updated": 1720238967, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497217237949371338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168463915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997376058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty boring story so far \n\nNot much has changed so i guess if you liked the last few expacs...well here's more.\n\nI dont much care for Erenville and they kinda force him down your throat", "timestamp_created": 1719636777, "timestamp_updated": 1719636777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494798749685287476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168462226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991221713", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 15744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 0}, "language": "latam", "review": "Compre pensando que podia jugar la nueva clase y parece ser que tengo que tener un trabajo a nivel 80 :/", "timestamp_created": 1719634886, "timestamp_updated": 1719634886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354998886585235596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168459026", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999715960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait until at least 7.1 or 7.2 to buy. Out of all MSQ's, this one is easily the worst in writing and pacing; previous expansions we got to the first dungeon pretty fast and they all kicked off with a banger - Holminster and Tower of Zot were both amazing intros. This expansion, the first dungeon takes about double to triple the normal time to even reach and all the quests leading up to it are not the most well paced and written (you literally do 2 escort quests back to back and then go collect random crap to complete the XIV equivalent of One Small Favor which spans 2 whole quest arcs and then you will finally do the dungeon).  New characters are also not the most well written either. Some scenes will make you cringe because of how poorly acted or written it is. Pretty much the only thing that will save this expansion are the raid and savage tiers.\n\nEdit: I also have over 6000 hours in XIV and I will defend my statement that this MSQ is seriously the worst they've ever done.\n\nEdit 2: Getting over the initial slog, there are some genuine good bits to the writing. However, we are now back to where we started with ARR. It's not fair or right to tell people they have to suffer through hours and hours of absolute garbage to get to the good parts. As to Wuk's voice actress, the lines themselves aren't bad and she did a good job with some of them.

The music is great. On to the downsides:\n\nHere are some principles to follow for a story-based MMORPG - principles, I must add, that were demonstrated very well in every previous FFXIV expansion:\n1. MMORPGs are about combat first. Not the MMO part nor even the RP part - but the G part. The game. The fighting. The part of the product where you are [i]doing[/i] something.\n2. The characters that are key to the plot of the story must be interesting. They don't even necessarily need to have \"character development\", although it is a good idea. Character development is meaningless if the character is uninteresting in the first place.\n3. The player must be made to feel that their presence in the story is meaningful.\n\nDawntrail is a narrative disaster that fails on all of these principles. My disappoint is immeasurable and my day is, as you may expect, ruined.\n\nIt fails on principle 1:\nBecause combat is treated more like an inconvenient necessity in the MSQ than as something you should ostensibly enjoy. You can proceed through the ENTIRE MSQ having defeated fewer than 100 enemies outside of duties - I'm pretty sure I did, and not because I wanted to avoid fighting! In fact, there is a noticeable scarcity of unique enemy types present in EVERY Dawntrail zone. Hope you like the cute bat things in the final zone, because they're one of only 5-6 \"standard enemies\" in the zone, total.\n\nIt fails on principle 2:\nBecause every important character in Dawntrail is bland or self-contradictory in a manner that indicates incompetence. But for the sake of keeping this review from spilling into novel-length territory, yes, Wuk Lamat is the greatest offender. She only has one character flaw (insecurity about how she is perceived as a would-be leader) and that becomes resolved early on in the MSQ. For the entirety of the MSQ, she is a perfect little cinnamon roll, a hecking wholesome chungus worth all the updoots. She just loves her nation's people so much and cares about every little thing and always knows the right thing to say! Everyone loves her (except the bad guy)! Don't you love her too?!? \n\nThis is commonly known as a \"Mary Sue\". \n\nWuk could have had an interesting flaw, or multiple flaws, and developed as a person over the entirety of the MSQ. She could have been arrogant and had to learn that to lead a nation requires a balance of pride in nation and humility in self. She could have learned that her cluelessness about how to lead indicated that she was uneducated in things like economics, logistics and the needs of a diverse people. She could have been racist and had to learn how all of the nation's peoples were valuable contributors to the nation's welfare! But no. She throws pity parties, until she doesn't, and then she's a blameless, faultless Hercules. \n\nWuk Lamat has a lot of fans, which I am certain is for two reasons:\n1. She is the player's introduction to the long-awaited female hrothgar.\n2. She's cute and sweet (although I don't see the cute part outside of the kitty face).\n\nThat's all it takes to have your character praised if you've got the kind of audience before which you can simply jangle keys. Jangle them keys.\n\nIt fails on principle 3:\nBecause your character well and truly does not matter. It's not your story in any regard. Heavensward is the story of the long-running animosity between the knights of Ishgard and the dragons, and you play a key role in that. Shadowbringers is the story of a world fallen out of balance by nefarious forces, and you play a key role in that. Dawntrail is the story of how a perfect little princess goes on an adventure, and you... are dragged along for the ride. With such consistency, I might add, that there is very little relief from the 'babysitting' that many, many other reviewers mention. And it is relieving indeed. \n\nThis is a product for which the Jangling Keys Enjoyers have had to issue a great volume of what's known as \"cope\"; poor rationalizations for why it's ok that this product is bad, and that it's good, actually. Unfortunately, all of their arguments boil down to saying, \"you expected to be a hero like in the core game and the last 4 expansions? You expected the story to involve you? Heh, don't you know that your WoL is on 'holiday'?\"\n\nNo reductive smugness will change that my Final Fantasy involves going on adventures and being a hero, but unlike ARR, Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers AND Endwalker, this doesn't feel like a very fun fantasy. I'm just glad that my MSQ is over.\n\nOne final sad note: This is well outside the scope of product for which the reasonable reaction to dislike would be to simply not play it. Because Dawntrail is a permanent part of the game, now. It's now a black mark in the process of experiencing the game. You'll have to grimace at every new player you recruit, knowing that when they come off the high of Shadowbringers and Endwalker back-to-back, they can look forward to several hours of the game's weakest-ever content. I wonder if it's possible for Yoshi P to pull a second ARR. I'm speaking in serious tones because I love FFXIV as a whole. I think it's the greatest MMORPG of all time, and I have played a whole lot of MMORPGs. XIV deserves better than Dawntrail, and so do the Warriors of Light that have journeyed through an epic's worth of curated story and the hundreds of duties that came with it.\n\n====================\n\nOriginal review follows below:\n\nThe story is all about the worst main character they've ever written and the long beginning stretch of the story involves learning about peaceful cultures where nothing, or close to nothing, is going wrong, while you fight nothing. The early zones are not interesting or dangerous in any fashion, and the cultures you spend the time getting to know are simply not enough to carry the experience.\n\nI just have a sinking feeling as I continue.
